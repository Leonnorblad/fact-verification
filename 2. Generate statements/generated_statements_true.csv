SC-40 was a wooden-hulled 110-foot (34 m) submarine chaser built at the New York Navy Yard at Brooklyn, New York. She was commissioned on 13 February 1918 as USS Submarine Chaser No. 40, abbreviated at the time as USS S.C. 40.

In 1919, Submarine Chaser No. 40 participated in North Sea minesweeping operations to clear the North Sea Mine Barrage after World War I.
When the U.S. Navy adopted its modern hull number system on 17 July 1920, Submarine Chaser No. 40 was classified as SC-40 and her name was shortened to USS SC-40.
On 14 October 1924, the Navy sold SC-40 to the Florida Boat Company of Washington, D.C.

Taxi 5,"Taxi 5 (French: Taxi Cinq) is a 2018 French action comedy film directed by Franck Gastambide.  A sequel to Taxi 4, it is the fifth installment of the Taxi film series and features different characters.


== Plot ==
Sylvain Marot, inspector of the Paris police, is considered one of the best police officers in the French capital, who dreams of serving in the special forces. After it is found out that he slept with the Mayor's wife, he is transferred to the municipal police of Marseille, whose mayor is the former Commissaire Gibert. While chasing a taxi driver, he ends up drowning the patrol car and as a result enters into a skirmish with the city police.
Gibert informs the team about a ""gang of Italians"", who use two powerful Ferrari for committing their crimes, and instructs Marot to arrest them. Due to the local police cars being under-powered, he realizes he won't be able to keep up with a Ferrari. Alain, a colleague of Marot, tells the newcomer about the legendary taxi of Marseille and about the adventures of Daniel and Emilien.
But years have passed: the car is now in Morocco, Emilien has left the police, and Daniel lives in Miami. Sylvain and his team find Daniel's nephew, Eddie Makhlouf, who was the taxi driver he was chasing. Sylvain offers Eddie a deal; find his uncle's taxi, and he will be set free.
Eddie makes a counter-offer, stating that he wishes to be the driver of the taxi when they find it. They find the car, but it turns out that the nephew does not have the talent of his uncle. The next day, they begin operation ""Mafia"", as named by Gibert. As the thieves are escaping, Gibert makes a mistake leading to a car pile-up, one of the victims of which is revealed to be the Minister he had met previously.
Sylvain chases after the thieves, but is still unable to keep up with their cars. Realizing that the car needs more modifications, he ends up leaving the taxi with Eddie's sister, Samia. Sylvain is immediately smitten by her and tries to make a move but is turned down. He goes with Eddie to meet an ""Italian"" Rashid, who informs them about a place where the Italians train - an abandoned racing track. Sylvain and Eddie go there and win the race. One of the robbers, Tony Dog, a former driver for Formula 1, offers Sylvain a job and invites him to a private party.
The entire municipal police team is sent there. Eddie, disguised as a waiter, enters Dog's office and finds the plan for the next robbery - the theft of a diamond ""Cassiopeia"". He shows Sylvain the evidence, but when they hear someone coming, they try to hide in the room. Both overhear the robbers speaking to two corrupt city cops. Because of Eddie's stupidity, they get caught and Eddie ends up revealing everything to one of them. After Sylvain escapes through the window, Eddie is rescued by one of the police officers.
On the day of the robbery, the diamond ""Cassiopeia"" arrives in Marseille by helicopter. Before it can land, the robbers threaten to blow it up using a stolen military drone. After blowing up a couple of police cars as proof, the pilot is forced to fly the helicopter to a yacht. Sylvain and Eddie chase after the helicopter along with the cops.
The corrupt cops are stopped by Eddie's friends while clearing a path for the taxi. The cops commandeer a civilian vehicle, but they eventually get stopped by the municipal police while the robbers continue their pursuit of the taxi. After opening fire on the taxi, Sylvain uses the boost to gain more speed and as a result the taxi is sent flying off a cliff and crashing into the back of the yacht where Rashid has already claimed the diamond from the pilot.
The gang is then arrested, and the diamond is returned. Sylvain heads over to Samia to tell her about the car, when she reveals that it's already over the news. Eddie is shown on television pretending to be a cop while taking credit. He thanks Sylvain and Samia before ending it with a proposal to his girlfriend. In the hospital, Alain, seeing the broken taxi, is upset. Later at a ceremony, everyone involved is awarded.
Sylvain arrives in a Lamborghini confiscated from the Italians, followed by Samia in a new car she had been working on. Both then proceed to race to the airport.

Alan Robertson (geneticist),"Alan Robertson  (21 February 1920 – 25 April 1989) was an English population geneticist. Originally a chemist, he was recruited after the Second World War to work on animal genetics on behalf of the British government, and continued in this sphere until his retirement in 1985. He was a major influence in the widespread adoption of artificial insemination of cattle.In addition to his work on agricultural genetics, Robertson undertook extensive studies 
of other branches of genetics, developing an influential secondary theorem of natural selection. He acquired an international reputation, receiving state and academic honours from Europe, America and Asia.


== Education and early life ==
Robertson was born in Preston, Lancashire, the second and only surviving child of John Mouat Robertson, an employee of the Post Office, and his wife Annie, née Grace, who was the younger sister of the University of Cambridge mathematician John Hilton Grace. Annie Robertson died within days of his birth, and Alan was brought up by his aunt Bessie Grace on the family farm at Halewood, near Liverpool. He was educated at Halewood village school from where he won a scholarship to the Liverpool Institute High School in 1930. He distinguished himself there in languages and in science under the tutelage of the chemistry master L. A. Naylor. In 1938 he won a scholarship to Caius College, Cambridge to read chemistry. He graduated in 1941 with an upper second class degree, and became a research student in the Department of Colloidal Science at Cambridge.During the Second World War Robertson served in the Operational Research Section of Coastal Command. The head of the unit was Conrad Hal Waddington, who after the war invited Robertson to join him in a new research body, the National Animal Breeding and Genetics Research Organisation (NABGRO). In an obituary study of Robertson, William G. Hill wrote, ""At this stage Alan could have had no more than a passing acquaintance with genetics, but he did have a firm understanding of practical farming. … Waddington wanted to apply operational research methods to animal breeding and recognized Alan's mathematical talents and ability in operational research.""


== Research and career ==
After spending nine months in the US receiving training in genetics and animal breeding with Sewall Wright and Jay Laurence Lush, Robertson took up his work at NABGRO, based in Edinburgh. The organisation was split into two parts, and Robertson became a member of the Unit of Animal Genetics, where he spent the rest of his career. At first he worked on improving dairy cattle using mathematical and statistical methods to devise the most effective breeding programmes. Away from the everyday work of the Unit, Robertson also worked on evolutionary biology, studying how variation is maintained in populations, and particularly the roles of mutation and of stabilising selection. Hill writes that Robertson made ""original contributions to the theory of genetic change in small populations and introduced a theory of limits to artificial selection … a combination of mathematical insight, quantitative genetic principles, and practical context, of which only he was capable.""Robertson continued to work on dairy-related research and wider theoretical studies. He did much to introduce widespread use of artificial insemination in dairy cattle, and worked for many years on estimating genetic effects that influence quantitative traits, and he developed what became known as the ""secondary theorem of natural selection."" He held the post of Deputy chief scientific officerof his Unit, and kept away from administrative duties. Hill recalled that Robertson ""remained informal, approachable, and 'Alan' to all. His influence was through his papers, as a scientific referee, by personal contact (particularly in his famous morning coffee group), as a conference speaker and organizer, and as an example of efficient (if not organized) hard work."" His doctoral students included William G. Hill, Trudy Mackay and Paul M. Sharp.


=== Awards and honours ===
Robertson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1964. Two years later he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE). He was appointed Honorary Professor of Edinburgh University (1967), and received honorary degrees and memberships of the United States National Academy of Sciences (1979), the University of Hohenheim (1968), the Agricultural University of Norway (1984), the Danish Agricultural University (1986), the University of Liège (1986), and the Genetics Society of Japan. He was appointed Order of the British Empire in 1965, and received the Gold Medal of the Royal Agricultural Society (1958) and the Order of Isabel la Católica (1974).The Alan Robertson chair of Genetics at the University of Edinburgh is named in his honour. As of 2016 the post is held by Paul M. Sharp.


== Personal life ==
In January 1947, Robertson married Margaret Bernheim, a NABGRO colleague, with whom he had two sons and a daughter. He was a member of the Farmers Club. Robertson retired in 1985, and died in Edinburgh in 1989, aged 69.

Arthur Robertson (athlete),"Arthur James Robertson (19 April 1879 – 18 April 1957) was a Scottish runner who competed at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London. He won the gold medal in the 3-mile team race and a silver in the steeplechase.


== Career ==
The son of a Glasgow doctor, Robertson was educated at Kelvinside Academy, Glasgow, before moving to King's School, Peterborough at the age of 14.  A brilliant all-round sportsman, he initially concentrated on cycling and only took up serious athletics at the age of 25, after a cycling injury.In 1906, he joined Birchfield Harriers. In March 1908 he won both the English and International Cross-Country Championships and a second-place finish in the 4 mile race at the AAA championship earned him a place at the Olympics.
Robertson won easily in the first round of the 3200 metres steeplechase, finishing in 11:10.0. In the final, he trailed for most of the race.  At the bell, he passed one of the two then-leaders, American John Eisele.  Robertson was not quite able to catch the other leader, however, and trailed fellow Briton Arthur Russell by two yards at the finish. His final time was 10:48.4. At the same Olympics he won gold as a member of the 3-man 3 mile team race; the first Olympic gold won by a Scottish man and the first by a Birchfield athlete. He also participated in the five miles event and finished fifth. His brother David was a member of the British cycling team at the same olympics.On 13 September 1908 Robertson set a world record at 15:01.2 over 5,000 metres, running on a concrete cycle track in Stockholm. He retired from athletics after 1909 season and returned to cycling. Later, together with his brother, he ran a sports shop in Peterborough, and then passed it over to his son.Robertsone was posthumously inducted into the Scottish Sporting Hall of Fame in 2004. In January 2010, a new J D Wetherspoon pub in Perry Barr, Birmingham (close to Perry Barr Stadium, the former home of Birchfield Harriers) was named 'The Arthur Robertson' in his honour.

Adrien Silva,"Adrien Sébastien Perruchet da Silva  (French: [adʁijɛ̃ sebastjɛ̃ pɛʁyʃɛ da silva]; born 15 March 1989) is a professional footballer. A central midfielder, he is known for his dribbling and passing skills.He began his career with Sporting CP, making his first-team debut at the age of 18. In ten years with the club he played 237 games and scored 39 goals, and won the 2008 and 2015 Taça de Portugal trophies. He had loan spells with Maccabi Haifa and Académica, where he won the Portuguese Cup again. He signed with Leicester City in 2018, then served two loan stints at Monaco.
Born in France, Silva won 46 caps for Portugal at youth level, including 13 for the under-21 team. He made his senior debut in 2014 and played at Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup, winning the former tournament.


== Club career ==


=== Early years ===
Silva was born in Angoulême, Poitou-Charentes, France, to a Portuguese father and a French mother. He began his football career at the age of 10 with FC Girondins de Bordeaux, but after one year there his father, who worked in aeronautics, returned to Portugal and the family settled in Arcos de Valdevez. Silva spent two seasons with local Associação Recreativa e Cultural de Paçô, who later began to host a tournament in his honour, the A.R.C.Paçô–Adrien Silva Tournament, held every June.Silva then spent six years in Sporting CP's academy, and won four national and three regional championships. At the age of 15 he was scouted by Chelsea, along with Portugal under-16 teammates Ricardo Fernandes and Fábio Ferreira, and the three players trained at the English club's facilities in January 2005. Sporting filed a complaint with FIFA that Chelsea had not followed the correct procedures, and Silva stayed with Sporting, although Fernandes and Ferreira did later move to the London club.


=== Sporting CP ===
In March 2007, Silva signed his first professional contract, agreeing to a five-year deal with Sporting. In July, after spending the final two months of the season playing with the reserve team, he was officially promoted to the main squad by manager Paulo Bento ahead of the upcoming campaign. He made his Primeira Liga debut on 17 August, taking the field as a late substitute in a 4–1 home win against Académica de Coimbra; on 12 December, after appearing as an unused substitute in several league and European matches, he made his first professional start and Champions League debut in a 3–0 victory over FC Dynamo Kyiv. Four days later, he made his first start in the league in a 2–1 win at C.S. Marítimo.Silva featured in both legs of Sporting's round of 32 win against Bolton Wanderers in the 2007–08 UEFA Cup. On 16 April he started in the 5–3 win over S.L. Benfica in the semi-finals of the Taça de Portugal, being replaced after only 35 minutes in what was the last of his 15 appearances of the season.As in his first year, Silva struggled for minutes in 2008–09. He played his first match on 22 November 2008 in a 1–0 league defeat of Associação Naval 1º de Maio, playing 16 minutes off the bench. He made his first start in a 3–0 home win against Marítimo in the Taça da Liga, and he also made Bento's starting XI three months later in the Lions' 1–7 loss to FC Bayern Munich in the Champions League last 16 second leg. He made 19 appearances in all competitions, notably playing the full 90 minutes in home wins against of C.F. Estrela da Amadora and C.D. Nacional.
Silva scored his first career goal in a UEFA Europa League group stage match against Hertha BSC, the match-winner in a 1–0 win, when he also was sent off after collecting a second yellow card in injury time. On 28 November 2009, in the Lisbon derby, which ended 0–0, he made headlines in the Portuguese media because he covered the most distance of any Sporting player, having traveled over 10,049 metres (6.244 mi). Coach Carlos Carvalhal started him in 13 of the team's next 15 matches, but he eventually fell out of favour, as Sporting went on to finish in only fourth place with 48 points, the club's worst points total since the 1992–93 campaign.
On 27 June 2010, it was announced that Silva would be joining Israeli side Maccabi Haifa F.C. on a season-long loan deal. The move was facilitated by the player's agent Pini Zahavi, based in Tel Aviv. He made his debut for his new team on 29 July, in the first leg of the Europa League third qualifying round tie against FC Dinamo Minsk; he was rarely played in the Israeli Premier League, but was a regular in the campaign in the Toto Cup.
In January 2011, it was reported that Silva was considering going back to Portugal to regain match fitness. On the 16th, he spoke of his desire, telling daily sports newspaper A Bola: ""Returning to Portugal is an option that I like a lot since I can be followed more closely. In Israel, I don't have great visibility""; Three days later, a six-month loan to Académica de Coimbra was confirmed.Silva found the net in his first appearance with the Students, who were defeated 2–1 away against S.C. Olhanense. He was again used rarely, but now due to injury problems – he fractured the fifth metatarsal in his right foot in a game with U.D. Leiria in March, which sidelined him for the rest of the season.On 5 July 2011, Sporting and Académica extended the loan for a further season. On 26 September, completely recovered from his injury, Silva scored his first career brace in a 4–0 home win against C.D. Feirense; on 19 November, in the fourth round of the Portuguese Cup, he scored his team's second in a 3–0 shock victory over Porto, adding another double in the next round against Leixões SC (5–2 after extra time). He played the full 90 minutes in the final, a 1–0 defeat of Sporting which saw the Coimbra side lift their first domestic cup in 73 years.After returning to Sporting, Silva was awarded the club's Player of the Year award on 28 November 2013. He scored a career-best ten competitive goals in the 2014–15 season, while also helping the team reach and win the final of the Portuguese Cup.In August 2016, Silva confirmed in an interview with Portuguese newspaper O Jogo that Leicester City were interested in signing him. However, a deal could not be agreed on deadline day as Sporting wanted the club to pay his £38.5 million release clause. After the move was finally completed, he returned to Lisbon on 1 October 2017 and wished his former fans an emotional farewell before the 0–0 draw with FC Porto.


=== Leicester City ===
On 31 August 2017, Sporting agreed a £22 million fee for Silva to move to Leicester City, pending international clearance. The documents relating to his transfer did not reach FIFA until 14 seconds after the deadline; thus, he remained ineligible to play for the club until the next transfer window. In a statement on 24 October, Leicester chose not to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport as it was made clear to them that ""FIFA will not support an expedited process""; in an interview with The Guardian in March 2018, he said it was ""a very poor decision"" by FIFA, despite his appeals, to uphold his ban.Silva was officially registered on 1 January 2018, and made his debut that same day as a late substitute in a 3–0 win at home to Huddersfield Town in the Premier League. He was given the number 14 jersey, referring to his transfer difficulties. In a 2–0 defeat of Watford on 20 January, he came on for Jamie Vardy in the 89th minute and provided the assist for Riyad Mahrez's goal in stoppage time.Silva struggled for game time under manager Claude Puel, having not started a league match since 10 August 2018. He made only five appearances in all competitions, and was not included in the squad for a league match after 22 September. The manager's decision to leave the player out of the first team and make him train with the under-23s was criticised by the latter's father, who accused the former of unfairly ""picking on his son"".On 31 January 2019, Silva joined AS Monaco FC – coached by his compatriot Leonardo Jardim – on loan until June, with Youri Tielemans moving in the opposite direction. He made his Ligue 1 debut on 2 February, playing 18 minutes in the 2–1 home victory over Toulouse FC after replacing fellow Portuguese Gelson Martins.Despite a change of Leicester manager prior to 2019–20, Silva was still told that he was free to leave the club. On 23 August 2019, he rejoined Monaco on another loan. He contributed two assists in 22 appearances, before the season was abruptly concluded due to the COVID-19 pandemic.


=== Sampdoria ===
During a pre-match press conference ahead of the 2020–21 campaign, Leicester coach Brendan Rodgers said that Silva's future ""will be outside of here"". In October 2020, a financial agreement was reached to terminate the former's contract while he finalised a move to U.C. Sampdoria. Shortly after, the Italian club announced his signing on a two-year deal.On 3 January 2022, Silva's contract was terminated by mutual consent.


=== Al Wahda ===
Silva joined Al Wahda FC of the UAE Pro League on 4 January 2022, on a two-year deal.


== International career ==


=== Youth ===
Though born in France, Silva elected to play for Portugal, and represented the country at every youth level. With the under-16s he appeared at the Tournoi du Val-de-Marne, featuring in all three group stage matches – however, after he was found to have done unauthorised training with Chelsea, he was suspended by the Portuguese Football Federation. He played with the under-17 team as they attempted to qualify for the 2007 UEFA European Championship, being a regular as the side eventually fell short in the elite round.
On 30 January 2007, the Portuguese Federation announced that Silva would be participating in the 2007 Meridian Cup (for under-18 players) as the country's only representative, and he declared that he was ""very proud to represent Portugal in a European selection"". However, prior to the start of the competition, he suffered an injury and was replaced by compatriot Romeu Ribeiro.Silva was limited to only seven appearances with the Portuguese under-19s, due to his increased involvement with Sporting's first team. He scored his first goal in the age group on 6 November 2007, in the first round of qualification for the 2008 European Championship against the Republic of Ireland; despite a 2–1 victory, Portugal failed to progress past the elite stages.
On 5 February 2009, Silva earned his first call up to the under-21 team under coach Rui Caçador, for a friendly match with Switzerland that was played five days later. He started and played 78 minutes, before being substituted in a 3–1 win. He was a regular participant in the qualification campaign for the 2011 European Championships, appearing in five out of nine matches and scoring in a 1–1 draw to Macedonia.


=== Senior ===
Silva was called up by new Portugal coach Fernando Santos for a friendly in France on 11 October 2014, but did not play in the 1–2 defeat. He made his senior international debut in another friendly, replacing André Gomes midway through the second half of a 1–0 win over Argentina at Old Trafford on 18 November.Silva was selected for the Euro 2016 squad. His first game in the tournament took place on 25 June, when he played the full 120 minutes in the round of 16 clash against Croatia, a 1–0 win after extra time.Having also been picked for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup, Silva contributed four appearances as Portugal finished third. He scored his first goal for his country on 2 July, a 104th-minute penalty to help defeat Mexico 2–1 in the third place play-off.Silva was selected for the 2018 World Cup.

2015 Cotton Bowl Classic (December),"The 2015 Cotton Bowl Classic was a college football bowl game played on December 31, 2015 at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The 80th Cotton Bowl Classic was a College Football Playoff semifinal between Alabama and Michigan State with the winner to compete in the 2016 College Football Playoff National Championship. It was one of the 2015–16 bowl games that concluded the 2015 FBS football season.
The game was broadcast on ESPN, ESPN Deportes, ESPN Radio and XM Satellite Radio. It was sponsored by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and was officially known as the College Football Playoff Semifinal at the Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic.
Alabama defeated Michigan State 38–0 and later won the National Championship by defeating Clemson in the National Championship game.


== Teams ==
The Cotton Bowl acted as one of the two College Football Playoff semifinal games. The two teams selected for the game were No. 2 Alabama and No. 3 Michigan State. Michigan State returned to the Cotton Bowl after defeating Baylor in a non-playoff version of the bowl game on January 1, 2015. Michigan State became just the third school in history to play in the same bowl twice in a calendar year, joining Auburn, which played in the Gator Bowl on January 1 and December 31, 1954, and Oklahoma, which played in the Sugar Bowl on January 1 and December 31, 1972.
The game was a rematch of the 2011 Capital One Bowl, where Alabama defeated Michigan State 49–7.


== Game summary ==
After Oklahoma lost to Clemson 17–37 in the Orange Bowl Semifinal, Michigan State was throttled by Alabama 38–0. A tight first half saw Alabama take a 10–0 lead into half time. Near the end of the second quarter, Michigan State had its best drive of the night, but all-time winningest MSU quarterback, Connor Cook, was intercepted by Cyrus Jones. Alabama scored a touchdown on the opening possession of the second half and MSU turned the ball over on its first possession. Alabama could not capitalize on the turnover, but did return MSU's next punt for a touchdown, putting the game out of reach at 24–0 with a little over three minutes remaining in the third quarter. MSU's offense could not muster any points and were held to a total of 249 yards. Cook finished the night with zero touchdowns and two interceptions.
Alabama would go on to defeat Clemson 45–40 for the 2016 College Football Playoff National Championship.

Chelsea Green Publishing,"Chelsea Green Publishing is an American publishing company which specialises in non-fiction books on progressive politics and sustainable living. Based in Vermont, it has published over 400 books since it was founded in 1984, and now releases between 25 and 30 titles each year.


== History ==
The company was started by Margo Baldwin and her husband Ian in 1984 two years after moving from New York City to Chelsea, Vermont. They initially published books that appealed to their own interests, which included fiction, nature, travel, and art. Their first books were published in 1985—In a Pig's Eye, small-scale farmer Karl Schwenke's observations on ""the human qualities of pigs and the piglike qualities of humans,"" and the first trade edition of Jean Giono's The Man Who Planted Trees, with woodcut illustrations by Michael McCurdy. Among the books that followed in the next two years were Permanent Parisians (a guide to Paris cemeteries), Words and Images of Edvard Munch, and Steve Heller's novel The Automotive History of Lucky Kellerman.Not all of the books from their early, more eclectic range sold well, and the company was in financial difficulty by 1991. The Baldwins brought in Vermont business strategist Stephen Morris, who advised them to focus on a particular niche, sustainable living, and to build up a backlist that would keep selling over the years. He also negotiated a partnership with the Real Goods Trading Company, a California-based company whose customers were interested in living off the grid or with a low environmental impact, in which Real Goods bought Chelsea Green's books at steep discounts and then marketed them through their catalog, enabling them to reach a wider audience. Titles published by Chelsea Green in this area have included Alan Scott's  The Bread Builders: Hearth Loaves and Masonry Ovens, Sandor Katz's Wild Fermentation, and Athena Swentzell Steen, Bill Steen and David Bainbridge's The Straw Bale House. First published in 1994, The Straw Bale House proved to be one of the company's best-selling books in their sustainable living list, with 100,000 copies sold over the next five years, even though there were only between 1,000 and 2,000 straw bale houses in the United States at the time. Morris became Chelsea Green's CEO in 1998, as Ian Baldwin had begun pursuing a career as an artist and was increasingly involved in founding the non-profit Marion Institute. When Morris stepped down as CEO in 2002, Margo Baldwin took over the post.Under Margo Baldwin, Chelsea Green increasingly broadened their range to encompass books on progressive politics and environmental issues, a process that had already begun in 1992 with the publication of Beyond the Limits. They have since published George Lakoff's Don't Think of an Elephant, Naomi Wolf's  The End of America, and Robert Kuttner's  Obama's Challenge, all of which made The New York Times bestseller list. Other books published by Chelsea Green in this area have included Diane Wilson's An Unreasonable Woman and Edward Hoagland's Sex and the River Styx, which won the 2012 John Burroughs Medal for Distinguished Natural History Book. In 2008, Chelsea Green's pre-publication of Obama's Challenge drew protest from some independent and chain book sellers. Unable to print it before the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Chelsea Green made an exclusive agreement with Amazon to release it on a print-on-demand basis for two weeks in August and distributed discount vouchers to the convention delegates. In retaliation, Barnes & Noble said they would substantially reduce their 10,000-copy order and would sell the book only via their website, not in their stores. The book was released to retailers in September in an initial print run of 75,000 copies, which Chelsea Green said was the largest in their company's history.In 2012, the company began transferring the majority of its ownership to its employees through an employee stock ownership plan. Three years later, 78% of  Chelsea Green's stock was owned by its employees, with the Baldwins retaining the remaining 22%. In 2014, their 30th anniversary year, the company published The Chelsea Green Reader, an anthology of excerpts from books they had published during their first 30 years, encompassing poetry, fiction, memoir and biography, nature, travel, food and food culture, and environmental and economic policy. In 2015 they published Jonathan Tasini's The Essential Bernie Sanders, the first book-length treatment of Bernie Sanders' political agenda.Chelsea Green's books for children include natural craft books, the Gaia Girls environmental fantasy series by Lee Welles, and Patrick's Great Grass Adventure (2017) by Joel and Rachel Salatin about a pigeon and a grass-farmer.

Bibliothèque Marmottan,"The bibliothèque Marmottan, located in Boulogne-Billancourt, is a public library bequeathed in 1932 to the Académie des beaux-arts by its founder Paul Marmottan.
Dedicated to the First French Empire and open to readers interested in this period, it contains some 25,000 books and periodicals, making it one of the largest Napoleonic libraries in the world.While it regularly hosts scholars in residence, it will also, from 2023, have three apartments for artists whose work will be presented in the exhibition rooms.


== Historical background ==
Shortly after the death of his father, Jules Marmottan (1829–1883), a wealthy director of the Bruay mining company, the young Paul decided to devote himself entirely to his passion for Napoleon and the French Empire. In 1882, he owned a private mansion in Paris, now the musée Marmottan-Monet, and a few years later he acquired a plot of land in Boulogne-Billancourt.

The first librarian was Paul Fleuriot de Langle (1897–1968), Paul Marmottan's secretary, who established an initial classification of the books and wrote a guide to the collection that is still an authoritative reference.After his retirement, the library was neglected for several years before the Académie des beaux-arts appointed the art historian Bruno Foucart (1938–2018) as its scientific director in 1968. Foucart, who was in charge until the early 2010s, set up a regular purchasing programme and greatly expanded the collection devoted to the history of art in the first half of the 19th century.
In 1996, after major restoration and expansion work, the Académie des beaux-arts delegated the management of the bibliothèque Marmottan to the municipality of Boulogne-Billancourt. Now fitted with an auditorium that can host conferences and concerts, and more open to the public, the library is known for several exhibitions on the Napoleonic era, including ""Tapis d'Empire"" (2003), ""Les Clémences de Napoléon"" (2004) or, more recently, ""Jeux d'Empire"" (2017) and ""De Joséphone à Eugénie : l'éventail au XIXe siècle"" (2018).


=== Current status ===
The management delegation to the city of Boulogne-Billancourt ended in 2018, and the library has since been closed to the public during renovations. Since October 2020, it has been directed by the art historian and member of the Académie des beaux-arts Adrien Goetz.


== The collections ==
The vast majority of the bibliothèque Marmottan's collections are devoted to the First French Empire, which makes it, according to Bruno Foucart, ""the largest Napoleonic library in Europe"". While all aspects of the First French Empire are represented, books relating to its administration and administrators are undoubtedly one of the strong points of the collection.The history of the arts under the Empire and, more generally, thanks to the acquisition policy led by Bruno Foucart, that of the entire first half of the 19th century, constitutes the other dominant part of the collections. A section on the history and architecture of Paris has been expanded over the years, following the work of Paul Marmottan, a founding member of the Commission du Vieux Paris.

Since 1984, the bibliothèque Marmottan has been partially listed as a historical monument and was awarded the ""Maison des Illustres"" label in 2012.

Fourth Macedonian War,"The Fourth Macedonian War (150–148 BC) was fought between Macedon, led by the pretender Andriscus, and the Roman Republic. It was the last of the Macedonian Wars, and was the last war to seriously threaten Roman control of Greece until the First Mithridatic War sixty years later.
The last Macedonian king of the Antigonid dynasty, Perseus, had been defeated and dethroned by the Romans in the Third Macedonian War in 168 BC. In the aftermath of the war, Rome took indirect control of the region through a system of client states, and imposed harsh terms to prevent Macedon from becoming a powerful state again. This system was successful in maintaining Roman hegemony for nearly two decades, but broke down when Andriscus, a Greek who bore a resemblance to Perseus, claimed to be the former king's son and re-established the Macedonian Kingdom with Thracian troops.
Andriscus was initially successful, defeating Roman clients and a Roman army sent to stop him, and conquering much of Thessaly. However, he was eventually defeated by another Roman army under Quintus Caecilius Metellus at the Second Battle of Pydna in 148 BC, severely weakening his position; he was subsequently pursued and eventually betrayed to the Romans. After settling a few subsequent minor rebellions, Rome took direct control of Macedon, making it a Roman province.


== Background ==
Tensions between the Roman Republic and Macedon had first begun in 215 BC, when Philip V of Macedon allied himself with Rome's rival, Carthage, and declared war on Rome, sparking the First Macedonian War, an indecisive sideshow of the larger Second Punic War between Rome and Carthage. Soon after the end of the war with Carthage, a victorious Rome received multiple requests for assistance from a number of Greek polities and city-states which were afraid of Philip's ambition. Although war-weary from the recent Punic War, Rome agreed, and when Philip refused to accept their terms, they declared war on and defeated him in the Second Macedonian War of 200-197 BC, in which Philip was stripped of much territory and prestige, and forced to comply with Rome's demands. In the aftermath of this conflict, tensions developed between Rome and the Seleucid Empire, whose ambitious monarch, Antiochus III the Great, aimed to attain hegemony over Greece. Encouraged by the Aetolian League, Antiochus went to war with Rome in 192 BC, sparking the Roman-Seleucid War; it ended in a resounding Roman victory — Antiochus lost all his territory in Asia Minor and had to disband his fleet, pay a massive war indemnity and promise not to cross the Taurus mountains, effectively relegating the Seleucids to an Asiatic power and ending their influence in Greece. Macedon regained some territory and influence on account of their cooperation with the Romans in this conflict, but high-handed Roman actions and Macedonian revanchism continued to stoke resentment in Philip.Macedonian power continued to grow for the rest of Philip's reign, and this was continued by his talented son and successor, Perseus. Although Rome formally reaffirmed ""friendship"" with him, tensions continued to grow on account of reviving Macedonian power, Perseus' growing popularity with the Greeks and his successful diplomacy in the Greek world, in which he revived Macedonian influence and strengthened its position as a leading power once again. A tenuous peace continued until Eumenes II of Pergamon, a staunch Roman ally and Perseus' arch-rival, went to Rome in 172 BC and persuaded them that Perseus was a threat to Rome and the Greeks, and exhorted them to break his power. Finally, as Eumenes was returning to Pergamon, an assassination attempt on him, for which Perseus was blamed, resolved Rome in favour of war. The ensuing Third Macedonian War of 171-168 BC was hard-fought, but ended in a complete Roman victory and Perseus' surrender and imprisonment, establishing Rome's position as the sole hegemonic power in the Greek world.The Greek world was harshly treated in the aftermath of the Roman victory; allies of Perseus were brutally repressed, while those suspected to have sympathized with Perseus became pariahs in the new Roman-dominated order. Rome took unprecedented measures to ensure that a revival of Macedonian power would be impossible — the ancient Macedonian monarchy was abolished and Perseus was exiled to an Italian city. Knowing that occupying Macedon would require military presence against barbarian tribes on Macedon's northern frontier, Rome decided against making it a province; instead, Macedon was broken up into four client republics, or merides, that paid tribute to Rome, with trade regulations and restrictions on interaction between the republics, as well as being forbidden to work Macedon's rich mines freely, and limiting them to possessing only such military forces as were necessary to deal with barbarian tribes to the north. Most of the former ruling elite was deported to Rome. Macedon also suffered from impoverishment, due to the fiscal restrictions imposed on it and the looting of treasuries by victorious Roman troops at the end of the Third Macedonian War in 168 BC. This, along with the effective destruction of the old social order, created great resentment among many sections of the populace.However, Rome withdrew all its troops in 167 BC; thereafter, it left the Macedonian republics alone in their internal administration, not intervening even when appeals were made to it to resolve serious crises like a massacre of Macedonian officials in 163 BC. It has been suggested that Rome was seeking to satisfy the Macedonians with local autonomy, so that they would forget any sort of ""national"" identity; however, a general longing for monarchy persisted in Macedon, as the people had not yet adapted to democratic institutions, though a significant class of pro-Roman Macedonian republicans did develop, including those who had been persecuted by the old Antigonid monarchy. Some regulations were relaxed; for instance, the Macedonians were allowed to use their mines again from 158 BC, but resentment continued, including over those restrictions that remained, as well as the division of Macedon, leaving the situation ripe for the rise of pretenders to the old Antigonid throne.


== Andriscus claims the throne ==
Around 154/153 BC, a Greek named Andriscus, who bore a resemblance to the Antigonids, began claiming that he was Philip, a now-obscure son of Perseus, and had been reared in secrecy by a foster family. The origins of this youth are unclear; ancient sources generally agree that he was a man of low origins, and that he hailed from Adramyttium in Aeolis in northwestern Asia Minor. He entered Macedonia in force to claim ""his"" throne, but was repulsed, presumably by the combined forces of three of the four client republics (the third republic had been forbidden from raising troops by the settlement of 167 BC).At some point after this failure, he travelled to Syria and enlisted as a mercenary of the Seleucid monarch, Demetrius I Soter, and now began making his claims there. News of his claims spread, and after gaining enough notability, he appealed to the Seleucid monarch, Demetrius I Soter, to help him regain his throne. Despite riotous support for him from the population of the Seleucid capital, Antioch, Demetrius refused to help him, and instead arrested him and had him shipped to Rome. The senate, however, remained complacent; although he was brought before the senate, he was simply exiled to an Italian city. He soon managed to escape from Italy and fled back to the Greek world, but the Romans remained unpreturbed; they did not take him seriously.He travelled to Miletus, where he tried to advance his claims further, attracting significant attention. Diodorus writes that when the leaders of Miletus learned about this, they arrested him and sought advice from visiting Roman envoys on what to do with him; the envoys were contemptuous of the pretender and told the Milesians that he was safe to release. After his release, he continued to try and achieve his aim of becoming king of Macedon. He travelled to Pergamon to meet with Callippa, a former concubine of Perseus, who gave him money and royal regalia. From there he went on to Byzantium, where he was received favourably and obtaining a significant following and a number of sympathizers. Helliesen proposes that the following that Andriscus built up in this period derived from Macedonians who had fled to Attalid territory after the Third Macedonian War and had been settled in garrisons in western Lydia.Andriscus then travelled to Thrace, where he found allies and sympathy, especially from the Odrysian king Teres III, who was related to the Antigonids by marriage. Teres held a coronation ceremony for Andriscus, crowning him with a diadem, gave him a hundred troops, and introduced him to other Thracian leaders, including one Barsabas, who agreed to accompany him on his campaign to reclaim the Macedonian throne. He was also aided by some forces of Macedonian origin that Rubinsohn refers to as ""émigré rabble"".


== Course of the war ==


=== Andriscus' conquest of Macedon ===
With this force, Andriscus invaded Macedonia in the spring of 149 BC. Initially, he failed to inspire much popular support for himself among the Macedonian populace, emboldening the Roman client republics in Macedon, and making the Roman Senate complacent about the risk posed by the pretender. There are indications that his first attempts to conquer Macedon were failures; he rallied his resources and tried again, meeting the forces of one of the republics in a battle on the banks of the Strymon river, defeating them soundly and conquering all of Macedonia east of the Strymon, including the old royal capital of Pella where took up residence, around the summer of 149 BC. At this point, he assumed the regnal name Philip. The Macedonian republics to the west continued to resist him, but were defeated in another battle on the west bank of the Strymon, after which the Macedonians seem to have accepted him as king.
His victories gained him the loyalty of the Macedonians; the people longed for monarchy and were willing to accept a ruler, and were eager to get rid of the artificial divisions and factional strife of the client republics. On the other hand, the neighbouring Greeks, including the historian Polybius, were taken by surprise; Polybius writes in astonishment of how the pretender who had ""dropped from the skies"" and, in his view, was a tyrant, could be accepted, let alone enthusiastically, by the Macedonians. Eckstein puts this view down to the fact that Polybius and the Greeks were part of a deep-rooted republican society, and could not comprehend the Macedonian longing for a hallowed monarchical past. Andriscus now attacked Thessaly; the Thessalian League appealed to the Achaean League for aid, knowing that any Roman involvement would be slow to come. They and the remnants of the pro-Roman Macedonian forces resisted him for some time, until Rome finally decided to send a legate, Scipio Nasica Corculum, to assess the situation.


=== Roman involvement ===
Scipio was sent with the purpose of negotiating a peaceful settlement; Gruen remarks that the fact that Rome believed in the possibility of a peaceful settlement at this stage shows that they were either out of touch with the situation or were not really committed to the settlement they had drawn up in the aftermath of the Third Macedonian War. It has been suggested that there is a possibility that he was sent before news of Andriscus' campaigns became widely known, and that he was simply sent to dissuade any Greek sympathy for Carthage, which Rome was planning to attack. Whatever the case, Scipio's attempts at diplomacy failed, probably because the Romans were unwilling to accept Andriscus' demand to be recognized as king of a unified Macedon. Instead, Scipio resorted to military action, and began to rally the forces of Thessalians and Achaeans that had already been fighting. With them, he managed to temporarily halt Andriscus' advance. Still, the Roman commander informed the Senate that direct military intervention would be needed to stop the pretender, as the situation was getting dire, with Andriscus already having conquered significant parts of Thessaly.


=== Thalna's defeat ===
In response to Scipio's report, the Senate appointed a praetor, Publius Juventius Thalna, to command a legion and settle the situation with military force. Thalna was probably reinforced by Greek contingents, and spent two or three months stabilizing the situation. However he seems to have underestimated Andriscus, not understanding that Andriscus' army had swelled dramatically since his enthronement, including contingents of both Macedonians and Thracians. Thalna's attempt to invade Macedonia via Thessaly was intercepted by Andriscus at an unspecified location near the borders of Macedon in  late 149 or early 148 BC; details of the engagement are scarce, but Thalna was killed and his army almost annihilated, with the survivors escaping under the cover of night. It was the worst defeat Rome had suffered so far in their campaigns against Hellenistic powers, and had massive psychological impact in both Greece and Rome.Domestically, Andriscus' popularity was greatly increased, and he launched another invasion of Thessaly, successfully devastating and conquering most of it. Foreign interest in him increased; Carthage, which was now at war with Rome in the Third Punic War, agreed to an alliance with him and promised him money and ships. On the other hand, Attalus II Philadelphus of Pergamon remained a staunch Roman ally; he had no intention of seeing a strong and revived Macedonia as a neighbour. The battle also underlined the fact that the Macedonians were committed to their newly-revived monarchy, however weak their king's claim.At the same time, the Macedonian victory also meant the end of any hopes of negotiated peace with Rome. The Romans could not take such a defeat lying down, and resolved to crush Macedonia as a power once and for all. Fears of Roman reprisal prompted defections in Macedon; Andriscus began to take harsh and cruel measures against any pro-Roman elements, conducting acts of terrorism and repression against them.


=== Metellus' campaign ===
Rome soon began preparing a full consular army of two legions to fight in Macedon; despite the difficulties associated with raising such a force when they already had many legions serving in other theatres of war, the Senate did not wish to take any risks in the aftermath of Thalna's crushing defeat, and strongly desired to avoid any possibility of military collaboration between Macedon and Carthage. Both Roman consuls for the year were already engaged in other theatres of war; therefore, the Senate entrusted the campaign one of the year's praetors, Quintus Caecilius Metellus, granting him proconsular powers.Arriving in Greece in the summer of 148 BC, Metellus received the assistance of the fleet of Attalus II, and made an advance along the Thessalian coast, while the Pergamene fleet threatened the coastal districts of northern Macedonia; Amphipolis seems to have passed out of Andriscus' control by this stage. To protect himself from both offensives, and to prevent the loss of Macedon's seaboard, the king took up a defensive position at Pydna, where the Roman commander engaged him in battle.


==== Second Battle of Pydna ====

Not many details survive about the battle, or the exact numbers of troops involved. The first clash was a cavalry skirmish, in which Andriscus' forces had the upper hand, defeating units of Roman cavalry. Before or around the time of this skirmish, a Macedonian cavalry commander named Telestes defected with a significant portion of the Macedonian cavalry.After this, Andriscus sent away some of his forces to continue his campaign in Thessaly, possibly due to supply issues or to threaten the Roman rear, or due to overconfidence. Metellus seized this opportunity to attack in full strength, possibly with the assistance of traitors in Andriscus' force; his forces soon routed both forces of Macedonians; Andriscus fled the battle.


== End of the war ==
The battle shattered Andriscus' army and broke the Macedonian war effort. He fled to Thrace and began raising another army there, but Metellus pursued him swiftly, forcing Andriscus into a new battle before his raw levies were fully prepared. This engagement was an easy victory for the Romans; as soon as the Macedonian front ranks were broken, the rest of the army fled in panic. Andriscus himself fled to the Thracian princeling Byzes, but Metellus managed to persuade the latter to become a Roman ally and hand Andriscus over, concluding the campaign.However, Macedon was not fully pacified yet. Another uprising, probably with Thracian support, arose under the leadership of a certain Alexander, who now declared himself to be a son of Perseus and occupied the basin of the Nestus River. However, he was quickly defeated by Metellus and forced to flee into Dardania. By the end of 147 BC, Metellus had largely pacified the country and restored order. This was not the end of Macedonian rebellions against Rome; another pretender would later cause a serious crisis in 143/142 BC, raising an army of 16,000 men before being defeated and killed by the quaestor Lucius Tremellius; apart from this, border crises with the Thracians, which had been an issue for previous Macedonian governments as well, continued.Metellus imposed penalties on the Macedonians, as well as on the Byzantines, who had earlier been sympathetic to Andriscus. He took significant booty, including some of the spoils taken by Alexander the Great at the Battle of the Granicus, and many valuable works of art. After settling subsequent affairs in Greece and Macedon, the victorious praetor later returned to Rome in 146 BC, where he was given the agnomen Macedonicus and granted a triumph. Andriscus was paraded in this triumph, and subsequently executed.


== Roman reorganization of Macedon ==
The Senate realized that the settlement of 168 BC could no longer sustain itself; the extent of support that Andriscus' uprising had won among the Macedonians demonstrated both the fragility of indirect control and the need for a thorough reorganization of Macedonia. It is likely that a senatorial legation was sent to Macedon, probably soon after Metellus' victory, and, together with Metellus, made administrative changes to governance in Macedon, transferring significant functions to a Roman praetor. From this point onwards, a legion and a praetor were permanently stationed in Macedon; this was the first time Roman troops were permanently based east of the Adriatic sea. Macedon was unified into a single administrative unit as the Provincia Macedonia; the new province included not only Macedon, but also parts of southern Illyria, as well as Epirus and Thessaly. This received mixed reactions; on one hand, the people welcomed the reunification of Macedon; on the other hand, they resented their loss of freedom and the harsher rule of the Romans. Many praetors would engage in corruption and extortion; besides, they were not as effective as previous administrations in protecting the region from barbarian raids.The exact nature and chronology of the provincialization is a matter of debate. It is known that a new provincial era, the ""Macedonian Era"", was proclaimed in 148 BC, but it is disputed as to whether this was to signify the formation of the province or Metellus' victory. Doubts have been expressed as to whether Metellus could have had the time to organize Macedonia into a province, and it has instead been suggested that it was one of the consuls of 146 BC, Lucius Mummius, who reorganized Macedon with the help of a decemviral commission while settling the affairs of Greece. Gruen and Eckstein doubt whether Macedon ever formally became a province, pointing out that the Macedonian merides continued to exist well into the early principate. In their view, what changed after the Fourth Macedonian war was the fact that from then on, a Roman praetor and his legion were permanently stationed in Macedonia; naturally, they gradually took on more administrative and bureaucratic roles, leading to an informal provincialization. Still, the presence of Roman officials after 148 BC was a sudden and clear change, and signified the loss of Macedonian and Illyrian freedom.


== Aftermath ==

Soon afterwards, the Achaean League in 146 BC mobilized for a new war against the Roman Republic. This is known as the Achaean War, and was noted for its short duration and its timing right after the fall of Macedonia. Until this time, Rome had only campaigned in Greece in order to fight Macedonian forces, allies or clients. The Achaean leaders almost certainly knew that this declaration of war against Rome was hopeless, as Rome had triumphed against far stronger and larger opponents, the Roman legion having proved its supremacy over the Macedonian phalanx.Polybius blames the demagogues of the cities of the league for inspiring the population into a suicidal war. Panhellenic rhetoric and the idea of triumphing against superior odds motivated the league into this rash decision. The Achaean League was swiftly defeated, and, as an object lesson, Rome utterly destroyed the city of Corinth in 146 BC, the same year that Carthage was destroyed. After nearly a century of constant crisis management in the Greek world, which always led back to internal instability and war when Rome pulled out, the Senate decided to establish the Roman province of Macedonia, covering all of mainland Greece and establishing a permanent Roman presence in the region, though a few territories like Athens and Sparta retained self-government and partial autonomy. More than a century later, Augustus would establish Achaea as a separate province.

Mark Johnson (referee),"Mark Eric ""Slick"" Johnson is an American professional wrestling referee, best known for working for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA).


== Career ==


=== World Championship Wrestling ===
Johnson gained national exposure in the late 1990s when he joined the Atlanta, Georgia-based World Championship Wrestling (WCW) promotion as a referee. After suffering elbow injuries in 1998 caused during a match by Konnan, he was sidelined until late 1999. When he returned, Johnson was given the gimmick of an unethical referee who actively favoured heel wrestlers (as opposed to the other referees, who officiated matches in an objective fashion). While in WCW, he was a member of the New World Order faction, wrestled several matches, refereed a total of eighty five main events and had the dubious distinction of being pantsed by Stacy Keibler during a match on pay-per-view. He remained with WCW until the promotion was purchased by the World Wrestling Federation in March 2001.In late 2001, Johnson toured Western Europe with the World Wrestling All-Stars promotion.


=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ===
Johnson worked for the Nashville, Tennessee based Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) promotion from its inception in 2002, portraying a corrupt referee who accepted bribes, continuing the character he first adopted in WCW. He left TNA after several months to focus on his rock band, The Slick Johnsons, which was entering a Battle of the Bands in an attempt to gain a recording contract. He returned to the promotion in March 2005, replacing Mike Posey as a regular referee.
At Against All Odds on February 12, 2006, Johnson confronted Director of Authority Larry Zbyszko, demanding to know who was to referee the main event title match between Christian Cage and NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett, suggesting that his experience in WCW made him an appropriate choice of referee. His inquiry was rebuffed by Zbyszko, who later revealed the referee to be the debuting Earl Hebner. Over the following weeks, Johnson repeatedly requested to referee main event matches, with Zbyszko rejecting his appeals each time. Zbyszko eventually was about to give in to Johnson's incessant requests when Johnson suddenly withdrew his request to become a senior referee. Johnson explained that TNA management would be sending in a new representative in the near future, and that everyone would have a clean slate at that point. This sparked the storyline of the new face of TNA management, in which backstage dialogue between Zbyszko and Johnson served to build up the debut of the newest authority figure in TNA Wrestling, later revealed at Slammiversary to be none other than Jim Cornette. During this time Johnson would frequently wear outrageous referee uniforms, such as elaborate bowties and striped shorts akin to those worn by a soccer referee.
On June 13, 2007, he left TNA to pursue other interests. At Bound for Glory on October 14, 2007, Johnson returned to TNA Wrestling as a full-time referee. At Final Resolution in 2008, he refereed a match between Gail Kim and Awesome Kong. Johnson was powerbombed and hit with a chair by Awesome Kong. At Victory Road, he turned heel again when he helped Angelina Love of The Beautiful People regain the TNA Women's Knockout Championship even though Tara clearly had her foot on the ropes. Later on in the pay-per-view, Slick was seen leaving the Knockouts shower room and as he left, Madison Rayne of The Beautiful People came out from the same cubicle as him adjusting her top, implying that the two had sex. However, it didn't last; he resumed being fair to both faces and heels shortly thereafter. Johnson left TNA in late 2010.

HMS Sappho (1891),"HMS Sappho was an Apollo-class cruiser of the British Royal Navy which served from 1892 to 1918 in various colonial posts as well as around Britain.
From 1900 she served as a troop ship during the Second Boer War, but in June 1901 she went aground while crossing the Durban Bar and had to leave for repairs in the United Kingdom. She was escorted from Las Palmas by HMS Furious and arrived at Sheerness on 21 August 1901, proceeding to Chatham for repairs the following day. She was paid off at Chatham 18 September 1901.On the night of 19 June 1909 Sappho was rammed by a Wilson Line steamer which collided with Sappho in thick fog off Dungeness. The cruiser was holed below the waterline, flooding her engine room. The cruiser almost sank, but was saved by tugs and was taken to Chatham for repair. Despite the damage, with an 8 by 6 feet (2.4 m × 1.8 m) hole in her hull, the cruiser was repaired and able to return to service within six days. On 30 September 1909 Sappho was paid off at Portsmouth Dockyard for a refit.On the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Sappho was attached to the Grand Fleet. While other ships of the Apollo-class had been converted to minelayers, Sappho was initially deployed on patrol purposes, operating north-east of Shetland in early October 1914 as part of extensive deployments of the Grand Fleet to prevent German interference with a convoy carrying troops from Canada to England and north of Orkney later that month. Sappho continued on patrol duties, and was placed in charge of four Armed Boarding Steamers, which were tasked with patrolling to the north-west of the Hebrides, to stop merchant ships suspected of carrying contraband bound for Germany.In May 1918, Sappho was ordered to be scuttled in the mouth of Ostend harbour in Belgium following the failed First Ostend Raid. The Second Ostend Raid operation (of which Sappho was a part) was intended to block the harbour mouth and prevent the transit of German U-boats and other raiding craft from Bruges to the North Sea. Whilst travelling from Dunkirk to Ostend on the day of the attack however, Sappho suffered severe engine damage in a minor boiler explosion and was forced to retire, taking no part in the raid. She was not used again during the war, and was scrapped in 1921.

Goose Creek (Potomac River tributary),"Goose Creek is a 53.9-mile-long (86.7 km) tributary of the Potomac River in Fauquier and Loudoun counties in northern Virginia. It comprises the principal drainage system for the Loudoun Valley.


== Course ==
Goose Creek rises somewhere near Linden,VA in the Manassas Gap.  The creek initially flows eastward down the mountain, falling 600 feet (180 m) in its first 10 miles (16 km).Once in Loudoun, the creek continues in a northeastward direction for 15 miles (24 km) to the western foot of Catoctin Mountain, where it turns to the north briefly, before reaching the confluence of the North Fork and then turning to the east and cutting through a gap in the mountain.  On the east side of the mountain the creek again turns to northeast, joining with the Little River.  The creek flows for 15 miles (24 km) through central Loudoun County, reaching the Potomac just east of Leesburg,south of Harrison Island,and west of Selden Island.  Goose Creek is partially dammed north of State Route 267. The dammed part is called Goose Creek Reservoir.The dam may be portaged through the woods on the eastern shore.There is also Beaverdam Reservoir,which comes from a source of water called the Beaverdam Creek,which branches off of Goose Creek.


=== North Fork ===
The North Fork of Goose Creek rises at the east end of Sleeter Lake in Round Hill and flows 13.3 miles (21.4 km) in a southeastward direction, joining with the main branch in the water gap of the Catoctin Mountain.


== Conservation ==
The Goose Creek Association works to protect the watershed and landscape.


== Map of Goose Creek ==
In 1849, construction began on a system of locks and dams to render the creek navigable up to three large mills in the Loudoun Valley on the Little River, North Fork and main creek bed.  Across the Potomac from the mouth of a creek, a special lock on the C&O Canal was constructed to allow canal boats from Goose Creek to enter the canal.  By 1845, the Goose Creek and Little River Navigation Company canal system had been completed on Goose Creek to Ball's (Evergreen) Mill, 12 miles (19 km) upstream from the mouth.  Due to financial concerns it was decided that the canal would not be built any further upstream.  Though the lower portion of the canal saw significant usage, only one boat was ever known to have traveled the whole stretch, and by 1857 the canal was put out of business by the completion of the Alexandria, Loudoun and Hampshire Railroad to Leesburg.  Most of the locks and dams were destroyed by the Union Army during the Civil War.
Goose Creek Bridge on the Ashby's Gap Turnpike was the site of a Civil War battle in the Loudoun Valley during the Gettysburg Campaign in 1863. (See Battle of Upperville#Goose Creek for details.) The bridge was built between 1801 and 1803 and is the longest remaining stone turnpike bridge in the state of Virginia.
In The Water Dancer, a slave narrative style novel by Ta-Nehisi Coats, the Goose serves as both a water symbol and the geographic location of the fictionalized tobacco farm, Lockless, Virginia.

== The Rawls Course ==

The Rawls Course, home of the Red Raiders golf teams, is located on the Texas Tech campus. Alumnus Jerry S. Rawls donated $8.6 million toward the total cost of approximately $15 million course. Completed in September 2003, the course features an 18-hole course, 60-acre (240,000 m2) driving range, pitching and chipping areas and an indoor facility containing three hitting bays. The Rawls Course was designed by Tom Doak of Renaissance Golf Design, Inc., Traverse City, Michigan. Starting from just a cotton field, the course was created to imitate the land east and south of Lubbock, where the Great Plains suddenly begin falling into the valleys and canyons that lead to the Caprock region. Lubbock's strong prevailing winds figured prominently in the course's final design. Both Golf Week and Turfnet magazines ranked The Rawls Course as the third best collegiate course in the United States. Golf Magazine ranked it as the second most affordable U.S. course and placed it twenty-third on their list of top 50 golf courses in the nation for $50 or less.

Roads and freeways in metropolitan Detroit,"The Detroit metropolitan area in southeast Michigan is served by a comprehensive network of roads and highways. Three primary Interstate Highways pass through the region, along with three auxiliary Interstates, and multiple state and U.S. Highways. These are supplemented by the Mile Road System, a series of local roads spaced one mile apart on a perpendicular grid.
Many of the grid's east-west roads are known by numbers, such as 8 Mile Road, the system's baseline and Detroit's northern border. Intersecting this grid are five diagonal spokes, major arterial roads which travel from downtown to the suburbs. Most major roads in the city and suburbs follow this grid, though streets in some areas (particularly within Detroit, and near Lake St. Clair and other lakes) deviate.


== History ==
Following a historic fire in 1805, Judge Augustus B. Woodward devised a plan similar to Pierre Charles L'Enfant's design for Washington, D.C. Detroit's monumental avenues and traffic circles fan out in a baroque-styled radial fashion from Grand Circus Park in the heart of the city's theater district, which facilitates traffic patterns along the city's tree-lined boulevards and parks. The Woodward plan proposed a system of hexagonal street blocks, with the Grand Circus at its center. Wide avenues, alternatively 200 feet (61 m) and 120 feet (37 m), would emanate from large circular plazas like spokes from the hub of a wheel. As the city grew these would spread in all directions from the banks of the Detroit River. When Woodward presented his proposal, Detroit had fewer than 1,000 residents. Elements of the plan were implemented.
The Mile Road System extended easterly into Detroit, but is interrupted, because much of Detroit's early settlements and farms were based on early French land grants that were aligned northwest-to-southeast with frontage along the Detroit River and on later development along roads running into downtown Detroit in a star pattern, such as Woodward, Jefferson, Grand River, Gratiot, and Michigan Avenues, developed by Augustus Woodward in imitation of Washington, D.C.'s system.
The Mile Road grid came about largely as a result of the Land Ordinance of 1785, which established the basis for the Public Land Survey System in which land throughout the Northwest Territory was surveyed and divided into survey townships by reference to a baseline (east-west line) and meridian (north-south line). In Southeast Michigan, many roads would be developed parallel to the base line and the meridian, and many of the east-west roads would be incorporated into the Mile Road System.
The baseline used in the survey of Michigan lands runs along 8 Mile Road, which is approximately eight miles (13 km) directly north of the junction of Woodward Avenue and Michigan Avenue in downtown Detroit. As a result, the direct east-west portion of Michigan Avenue, and M‑153 (Ford Road) west of Wyoming Avenue, forms the zero mile baseline for this mile road system. While the roads are almost precisely aligned with cardinal directions, there are slight discrepancies—for example, the eastern terminus of 8 Mile Road in St. Clair Shores is at 42.45°N, whereas its western terminus (45 miles [72 km] away in Whitmore Lake) is 1+1⁄2 miles (2.4 km) south, at 42.42°N.

The precise point of origin is located in Campus Martius Park, marked by a medallion embedded in the stone walkway. It is situated in the western point of the diamond surrounding Woodward Fountain, just in front of the Fountain Bistro.


== Freeways ==
 I-75 (Walter P. Chrysler Freeway/Fisher Freeway)—runs generally northeast-southwest through Downriver, before turning northwest in downtown Detroit, following this path through Oakland County to the north. Continues to Flint and Sault Ste. Marie north of Metro Detroit, and to Toledo to the south, eventually ending in Miami, Florida.
 I-94 (Edsel Ford Freeway/Detroit Industrial Freeway)—major east-west route. Travels east from Ann Arbor through the southwestern suburbs (passing Willow Run and Metro Airports); runs northeast-southwest across Detroit, before turning north to run through Macomb County, and northeast to its end in Port Huron. Flanked by a service drive through most of Detroit. The segment of I-94 from Ypsilanti to Detroit was one of America's earlier limited-access highways, originally built to link Dearborn with factories at Willow Run during World War II.
 I-96 (Jeffries Freeway)—begins at the Ambassador Bridge downtown; runs east-west through western Detroit and Livonia; turns north to run concurrently with I-275 along Livonia's western edge, before turning northwest again in Novi, passing through Wixom and Livingston County as it heads west toward Lansing. Known as Jeffries Freeway, and flanked by service drive, east of I-275. Segment from Outer Drive to Davison Avenue has local and express lanes, the only such setup in Michigan.
 I-275—spur of I-75; major north-south route in the western suburbs, passing Metro Airport. Runs from I-75 in Monroe County to I-96/I-696 interchange in Novi. Originally intended to travel north 23 miles (37 km) from the I‑696/I‑96/I‑275/M‑5 junction to rejoin I‑75 in Springfield Township; the northward extension was cancelled, though partially replaced by M-5 in the 1990s.
 I-375 (Walter P. Chrysler Freeway)—short 1.062-mile (1.709 km) spur of I-75 in downtown Detroit, running from I-75 to Jefferson. Among the shortest Interstate routes nationwide.
 I-696 (Walter P. Reuther Freeway)—spur of I-96; major east-west route in the suburbs immediately north of Detroit. Runs from I-96/I-275 interchange in Farmington Hills to I-94 in Roseville. Flanked by service drive from Lahser Road east. Taken together, I‑275 and I‑696 form a beltway around Detroit.
 M-5—splits from Grand River west of Middlebelt to follow a short freeway segment through Farmington and Farmington Hills to the I-96/I-275/I-696 interchange in Novi. Continues north to Pontiac Trail as a signalized expressway, constructed from 1994 to 2002.
 M-8 (Davison Freeway)—short freeway through Highland Park connecting I-75 and M-10 with Woodward. Continues as arterial road at both ends, with M-8 designation continuing west to I-96. Opened in 1942, this was the first modern depressed limited-access freeway in America.
 M-10 (John C. Lodge Freeway)—begins at Jefferson Avenue in downtown Detroit; runs largely parallel to I‑75 from Downtown Detroit to Wyoming Avenue, where it turns northwesterly and largely maintains this trajectory through the Mixing Bowl interchange with I-696 and US 24 in Southfield. Continues as Northwestern Highway, a surface boulevard, from I-696 west to its end at Orchard Lake Road in Farmington Hills. Flanked by a service drive for most of its freeway length.
 M-14—east-west route through western suburbs, connecting I-96 to Ann Arbor.
 M-39 (Southfield Freeway)—north-south freeway from I-94 to M-10, mostly running through Detroit's west side. Flanked by a service road for its entire freeway length. Continues as a surface arterial road, Southfield Road, at both ends, carrying the M-39 designation through Fort Street to the south.
 M-53 (Van Dyke Freeway/Christopher Columbus Freeway)—splits from Van Dyke Avenue at 18 Mile; runs as freeway, with few exits, north to Romeo.
 M-59—runs as freeway from Pontiac east to Utica, where it becomes Hall Road, a major arterial road along the 20 Mile alignment. Arterial road west of Pontiac, through Waterford and White Lake, ending at I-96 in Howell.


== Diagonal spoke arterial roads ==
Listed clockwise from southwest to northeast.

 M-85 (Fort Street)—runs southwest from Campus Martius Park through southwestern Detroit before turning due south in the suburbs. Forms a major commercial corridor in the Downriver region. Ends at I-75 near Flat Rock.
 US 12 (Michigan Avenue)—begins at Campus Martius Park; runs due west along the 0 Mile alignment; turns southwest at I-94, with Ford Road following its prior path. Forms the basis for Dearborn's commercial districts, and carries on through the western suburbs and past Willow Run Airport. West of Metro Detroit, US 12 continues west through Michigan, then through Chicago and west across the United States to its end in Washington state.
 M-5 (Grand River Avenue)—runs directly northwest from downtown Detroit through the city's west side to Farmington, where it turns west, assuming the position of 10 Mile. Turns northwest again at Halsted Road, and runs through Novi toward Livingston County. Designated M-5 from M-10 to Middlebelt Road, where M-5 breaks from Grand River to follow a freeway. West of Detroit, Grand River continues through Brighton, Howell, and Lansing, eventually ending near Grand Rapids.
 M-1 (Woodward Avenue)—widely considered the Detroit area's main north-south thoroughfare, and designated as a National Scenic Byway and Pure Michigan Byway. Runs from downtown Detroit northwest through Midtown, New Center, and Highland Park, then through a series of small suburbs (often called the Woodward Corridor), including Ferndale, Royal Oak, Birmingham, and Bloomfield Hills, before ending at a large loop in Pontiac. Widely known as the site of the Woodward Dream Cruise, a classic car cruise held on the route every August.
 M-3 (Gratiot Avenue)—runs straight northeast from downtown Detroit through Mt. Clemens, serving as a major thoroughfare through Detroit's east side and much of urbanized Macomb County. Continues northeast through rural Macomb and St. Clair counties to its end in Port Huron.
Jefferson Avenue (known as Biddle Avenue in Wyandotte, and Lake Shore Road in Grosse Pointe Farms and Grosse Pointe Shores)—scenic highway running along the shore of the northwesternmost end of Lake Erie, the Detroit River, and Lake St. Clair. Forms a major corridor through Downriver, much of Detroit, the Grosse Pointes, and eastern Macomb County, with an interruption at Selfridge Air National Guard Base. Feeds into M-29 at its northern end, and continues to Port Huron and points north; to the south, Jefferson becomes U.S. Turnpike Road, which, in turn, leads into Dixie Highway and continues to Monroe.
 M-97 (Groesbeck Highway) begins in Detroit at Gratiot Avenue (M-3) and ends at Hall Road (M-59).

=== South of Ford ===
The grid continues south of Ford Road, with roads generally spaced one mile (1.6 km) apart up to, and past, the border with the state of Ohio. None of these roads connect to Detroit, and they are almost never referred to by mile numbers, officially or colloquially. Further south and west, along the Lake Erie shoreline, and through Downriver, the roads tend to fall off the grids more often, for several reasons, including remnants of the French ribbon farms and natural features preventing straight road building.

1 Mile—Cherry Hill Road—runs from Dearborn to Dixboro.
2 Mile—Palmer Road—runs from Henry Ruff to Canton Center, ends at Canton Civic Center.
Geddes Road—South 3 Mile, Superior Township to Canton Township. Carlysle Road in Inkster and Dearborn. Liberty Road in Washtenaw County.
4 Mile—Van Born Road—township border road, from Van Buren Township to Allen Park, where it ends at a trumpet interchange with M‑39 and its service drives. On the north, it borders Canton, Wayne, Westland and Dearborn Heights. On the south it borders Van Buren Township, Romulus, Taylor and Allen Park. Just before Lilley Road it falls off grid. West of that point, its gridline is occupied by Yost, Mott, Clark and Scio Church Roads.
5 Mile—Ecorse Road—former M‑17. Once a major artery to the Willow Run Expressway. West of US 12 in Washtenaw County almost migrates a mile. In Ypsilanti, the alignment is followed by Cross Street, which continues westward to Ann Arbor as Packard Road and Eisenhower Parkway. Becomes Waters Road west of Ann Arbor-Saline Road.
6 Mile—Wick Road/Tyler Road—runs from Allen Park to Willow Run Airport, with brief interruption at Pelham. Becomes Tyler at west end of Romulus. Grid position followed by Ellsworth Road in Washtenaw County.
7 Mile—Goddard Road—Romulus to Wyandotte, falls off grid just east of I‑75. Moran Avenue takes over to River Drive while Goddard turns southeastward, running jagged to Biddle Avenue in Wyandotte. In Washtenaw County, the alignment is followed by Morgan and Pleasant Lake Roads.
8 Mile—Northline Road (known as Ford Avenue in Wyandotte)—runs from Biddle Avenue in Wyandotte to Detroit Metro Airport. Briefly resumes west of Metro Airport, before feeding into I-94's service drive.
9 Mile—Eureka Road—runs from Biddle Avenue in Wyandotte west to Huron River Drive in Romulus. Forms southern boundary of Detroit Metro Airport, and comprises a major commercial corridor in Downriver.
10 Mile—Pennsylvania Road—township border road. Borders Wyandotte, Southgate, Taylor and Romulus on the north side and Riverview, Brownstown Township and Huron Township to the south. Becomes Bemis Road west of the Huron River.
11 Mile—Sibley Road—runs from Jefferson to Huron River Drive. Resumes as Willis Road west of the Huron River.
12 Mile—King Road—runs from Jefferson in Trenton to Vining Road in Huron Township. Becomes Judd Road west of the Huron River.
13 Mile—West Road/Huron Road—runs as West from Jefferson to Huron River Drive; resumes as Huron at interchange with I-275. Becomes Dunn Road and Talladay Road west of Huron Township.
14 Mile—Van Horn Road
15 Mile—Vreeland Road—city limit road, with Woodhaven and Trenton on the north side and Flat Rock, Brownstown Township and Gibraltar on the south side. Recently extended west of Telegraph Road. Gridline also occupied west of the Huron River by Ash Road and Arkona Road.
16 Mile—Gibraltar Road/Will Carleton Road/Oakville Waltz Road—runs as Gibraltar west to Flat Rock, becoming Will Carleton on the other side of the Huron River. Becomes Oakville Waltz west of I-275, then shifts a quarter mile south and heads toward Milan. Forms the southern border of Wayne County from the Huron River west.


=== Eastern Detroit and Grosse Pointe ===
On Detroit's far east side, which is aligned according to the French colonial long lot system rather than the Northwest Ordinance survey grid, Cadieux, Moross, and Vernier Roads are not extensions of 6 Mile Road, 7 Mile Road and 8 Mile Road, respectively. East McNichols (6 Mile) ends at Gratiot Avenue, with traffic continuing to Cadieux two miles (3.2 km) away via Seymour Street and Morang Drive. East 7 Mile Road ends as a short four-lane one-way side street at Kelly Road, two blocks east of where Moross veers off from 7 Mile, taking most traffic with it. Most traffic on 8 Mile Road continuing east of Kelly Road veers onto Vernier Road; 8 Mile continues as a side street eastward for a short distance past Harper Avenue. This is a common misconception by residents of Detroit, Harper Woods and Grosse Pointe, as Cadieux, Moross and Vernier appear to be extensions of their mile-road neighbors, but are in fact roads in their own right.

== North-south grid roads ==
The area's north-south roads, often colloquially called grid roads, are similarly spaced one mile (1.6 km) apart, perpendicular to the east-west mile roads. Like the east-west grid, north-south roads lose cohesion to the grid in much of Detroit, the Grosse Pointes, eastern Downriver, and in the lake-filled areas of Oakland County.
Listed from east to west:

Greater Mack Avenue—direct suburban continuation of Detroit's Mack Avenue. Exists in several discontinuous segments from 8 to 13 Mile.
Harper Avenue—diagonal road through Frazho, turns north to follow grid, then turns northeast again at 13 Mile.
Little Mack Avenue—begins at Harper just north of 9 Mile; ends at Gratiot just south of 14 Mile, resuming as residential street at 14 Mile. Widens to major road at 15 Mile, then continues for one mile to end at Metro Parkway.
Kelly Road/Romeo Plank Road—Kelly runs diagonally from Hayes Street in Detroit through 9 Mile in Eastpointe, then turns due north to follow grid; continues through Frazho, stops, and picks up in the same position from 13 to 15 Mile. Grid position carried on by Romeo Plank from Clinton River Road to 25 Mile.
Garfield Road—From Utica Road in Fraser to 22 Mile Road in Macomb Township.
Hayes Road—Although not fully contiguous, Hayes Road is a township border road through eastern Macomb County. Terminates at 28 Mile. Also continues south of 8 Mile in Detroit as Hayes Street to the large intersection of Harper, Chalmers and Hayes just near I‑94.
Schoenherr Road—Runs from McNichols to 29 Mile. Divided highway from Metro Parkway to 20+1⁄2 Mile, unpaved from 26 to 29 Mile.
Hoover Road/Dodge Park Road—carries M-97 as Hoover Street from McNichols to 8 Mile in Detroit, leads into Groesbeck at 8 Mile. North of 8 Mile, Hoover continues to Chicago Road, then is connected by Maple Lane Drive to Dodge Park's start at 15 Mile. Dodge Park continues to Utica Road; from 19 Mile north, its alignment is followed by the M-53 freeway.
 M-53 (Van Dyke Avenue)—Runs from Jefferson Avenue in Detroit to Grindstone Road in Port Austin. Although M‑53 ends at Gratiot Avenue in Detroit, Van Dyke Avenue itself actually continues to Jefferson Avenue in Detroit, adjacent to the Detroit River. At 18-Mile Road in Sterling Heights, M‑53 splits off towards the east into a freeway, and the grid road (old M‑53) continues northward as the Van Dyke Road (also signed in some places as the Earle Memorial Highway). South of 28 Mile Road, Van Dyke begins a northeast shift to a mile eastward and Camp Ground Road takes over to continue the grid.
Mound Road—Originally planned to be at least partially a freeway, connecting the Davison Freeway with I‑696 and the M‑53 Freeway; as part of these plans, a stack interchangewas built connecting it to I-696. Mound Road is the Avenue due north of the Renaissance Center. Not fully contiguous, falling off the grid as it turns into Auburn Road just north of M59. Resumes back to its grid just south of 23 Mile Road and ends at 32 Mile Road.
Ryan Road—Runs from 23 Mile in Shelby Township through Sterling Heights, Warren and into Detroit before falling off the grid at Davison.
Dequindre Road—runs along Oakland-Macomb county line. Not fully contiguous, falling off the grid briefly at 26 Mile before resuming just north of 28 Mile. Named for Antoine Dequindre.
John R Street/Road—begins just south of Grand Circus Park in downtown Detroit; runs parallel to Woodward, one block northeast, from Comerica Park to McNichols, where it turns north to follow the grid. Ends at Bloomer Park in Rochester. Named for former Detroit mayor John R. Williams.
Stephenson Highway—branches off of Rochester Road south of the Troy I‑75 Interchange and runs as a divided highway roughly 1/3 of a mile east of Campbell, before becoming the I-75 service drive just south of 12 Mile.
Rochester Road (known as Main Street in downtown Rochester)—splits off from Main Street (Livernois) at Catalpa; runs diagonally to meet Stephenson just south of I-75. Follows grid alignment from I-75 north to Attica. Designated M-150 from M-59 north to downtown Rochester. Grid position assumed by Campbell and Hilton from 14 Mile south.
Hilton Road/Campbell Road—runs as Hilton from 8 Mile to 10 Mile, Campbell from 10 to 14 Mile. Alignment followed by Rochester Road from I-75 north.
Livernois Avenue/Road (known as Main Street in Royal Oak and Clawson)—begins as diagonal street at Fort Street in Southwest Detroit; turns north to follow grid south of Joy. Ends north of 9 Mile in Ferndale, before resuming at I-696 as Main Street, and again becoming Livernois at 14+1⁄2 Mile. Stops at Dutton, before short unpaved stretch in Oakland Township, ending at 26+1⁄2 Mile. Portion running through Detroit was once known, and dually signed, as the ""Avenue of Fashion"". Southernmost section to Jefferson Avenue removed in early 2020s to build the Gordie Howe International Bridge.
Dix Road/Highway—begins at Oakwood Boulevard in Melvindale, runs just west of the Greenfield Road line through Lincoln Park and Southgate (where it becomes Dix–Toledo Highway) before turning southwestward at Northline Road.
Wyoming Avenue/Street/Crooks Road—begins as diagonal street at Jefferson; known as Dearborn Street, then Industrial Street, and finally Ferney Street, before becoming Wyoming. Turns north to follow grid at Ford Road. Becomes Rosewood Street at 8+1⁄2 Mile; ends at I-696, and briefly resumes as residential street under the name Wyoming. Crooks splits off from Main Street (Livernois) at Catalpa, running northwest before turning north to follow Wyoming's grid position at 13 Mile. Continues north to end at Avon; briefly resumes as Old Perch Road from Avon to Walton. Easternmost north-south grid road to reach Ford Road on the same north-south alignment. 2nd Street in Wyandotte almost follows this grid a few feet to the west.
Meyers Road—aligned on a half-mile line, Meyers runs from Capital Street (in Royal Oak Township) to just north of Tireman Street (1+1⁄2 Mile). From Tireman south to Michigan Avenue, Miller Road follows this gridline and then shifts to a south-southeasterly route to its terminus at Fort Street); and from just north of Capital Avenue to its terminus at 11 Mile Road, Scotia Road follows this gridline.
Schaefer/Coolidge Highway—begins as diagonal road at Jefferson; briefly known as Coolidge before becoming Schaefer at River Rouge-Detroit border. Turns north to follow grid at I-94. Becomes Coolidge again at 8 Mile, and runs north to end at South Boulevard, with an interruption at 14 Mile. Portions known as Monnier Road prior to Detroit's annexation of Greenfield Township.
Greenfield Road/Adams Road—begins as diagonal road at Schaefer; turns north to follow grid at Michigan Avenue, and runs north to end at 14 Mile. Resumes as Adams at Woodward (at roughly 14+1⁄2 Mile), continues north in place until 21+1⁄2 Mile, where it shifts a mile to the east, assuming the grid position of Coolidge. Ends at Stoney Creek Road near Lake Orion. Grid position assumed in the Downriver area by Burns Street in Lincoln Park and Southgate, Fort Street in Riverview and Trenton and Division Street in Trenton.

Southfield Freeway/Southfield Road—begins at Jefferson as undivided local road; becomes M-39 and widens to divided highway at Fort Street. Runs as limited-access expressway, with service drive, from I-94 to M-10, assuming grid position at Michigan Avenue. M-39 designation ends at M-10, though Southfield continues as an undivided arterial road, ending at Maple just west of downtown Birmingham. Grid position assumed by McCann Road/Avenue/Street in Southgate and Brownstown.
Allen Road/Pelham Road/Evergreen Road/Opdyke Road—begins as Allen at Fort Street. Allen turns northeast at Goddard (eventually ending at Greenfield), with Pelham following its grid position through Rotunda Drive. Resumes as Evergreen at Michigan Avenue, and continues north to end at Quarton. Briefly known as Cranbrook Road from 14 Mile to Maple, and as Covington Road from Maple to Quarton. Resumes as Opdyke at Woodward just north of Long Lake; runs north to end at Lapeer Road just south of I-75.
Lahser Road—runs from West Outer Drive (just south of Fenkell) to Square Lake.

Center road for the original Redford Township, now largely part of Detroit. Grid position assumed by Monroe Street in Dearborn, and Racho Road in Taylor and Brownstown.
 US 24 (Telegraph Road)—divided highway for most of its length, with short expressway portions. Follows the grid alignment from Brownstown Township to Southfield, where it strays slightly off the gridlines.

Merriman Road/Orchard Lake Road—begins as unpaved road from Huron River Drive to Eureka; begins again, paved, at north entrance to Detroit Metropolitan Airport. Runs north from DTW, becoming Orchard Lake at 8 Mile, and briefly stopping and restarting at Grand River. Turns northeast at Pontiac Trail and continues to downtown Pontiac, becoming Auburn Road at Woodward.
Farmington Road—residential street through Westland and Garden City; major road from Ann Arbor Trail north to Walnut Lake. Stops in downtown Farmington and resumes 1/4 mile to the west before returning to the grid at 10 Mile. Roughly follows center line of Oakland County.

Follows township boundary for most of its remaining length, from 5+1⁄2 Mile north to its end at Richardson Road. Runs alongside I-275 from Van Buren Township to Farmington Hills. Grid position assumed by Williams Lake Road to the north, and Hannan Road to the south.
Meadowbrook Road/Welch Road—Separated between 13 and 14 Mile. Haggerty follows this alignment in Canton.
Lilley Road—aligned on a half-mile line, Lilley forms much of the eastern border of the city of Plymouth, where it is also known as Mill Street. Becomes Northville Road at Wilcox, and runs north to end in downtown Northville.
Morton Taylor Road/Novi Road (known as Main Street in Plymouth)—begins at I-94 and runs north to Van Born.

Griswold Road/Tower Road—Tower Road is gravel. Griswold runs from 8 to 10 Mile in Lyon Township and South Lyon.
Pontiac Trail—Through some twists and turns Pontiac Trail ends in the northeast at Orchard Lake Road at the village of Orchard Lake and takes a meandering southwesterly route to New Hudson in Lyon Township to avoid the nearby shopping center and Interstate 96. This results in Pontiac Trail ending at Milford Road north of I‑96 and then continuing at a three-road intersection of Grand River, Milford and Pontiac Trail south of I‑96. Later turning south at the intersection of Silver Lake Road it goes south and through Downtown South Lyon as Lafayette Street and goes southwest to Ann Arbor and ends at Swift Street one block north of Plymouth Road in Ann Arbor.

Spencer Road/Marshall Road—Spencer Road runs from North Territorial to 8 Mile with a bearing to the east around 6 Mile. Marshall follows the same alignment with Spencer Road from 8 Mile to Silver Lake Road.


== Address numbering scheme ==
Addresses are generally numbered outwards from Woodward Avenue (south of McNichols Road) and John R Street (north of McNichols) for numbers on east-west roads and from the Detroit River (east of the Ambassador Bridge), a Norfolk Southern Railway/CSX Transportation railroad line between the Ambassador Bridge and the Rouge River, the Rouge River itself north to just past Michigan Avenue in Dearborn, an imaginary line from there to the eastern end of Cherry Hill Road and Cherry Hill Road for numbers on north-south streets, with the numbers increasing the further one is from these baselines.
Addresses in the Detroit area tend to be much higher than in many other major cities, with numbers in the 20000s common within the city limits and in the inner-ring suburbs. The highest addresses used in the Detroit system are the range 79000 to 80999, for north-south roads beyond 37 Mile Road in northern Macomb County, and from 81000 to the high 81900s in the portion of the city of Memphis that bulges about 0.5 miles (0.80 km) into St. Clair County. For many years, the Guinness Book of World Records incorrectly listed 81951 Main Street (M‑19) in Memphis as the highest street address number anywhere, but higher numbers are in use elsewhere in the United States. The Detroit system also extends as far west as Lyon Charter Township, whose supervisor's offices are located at 58000 Grand River Avenue, and as far south as the southernmost border of Wayne County.
With a few exceptions, one can determine which mile roads an address is between on major north-south roads north of Five Mile/Fenkell by using the formula:

[(first two numbers of the address)-5] / 2
Example: 34879 Gratiot Avenue [(34-5)/2]= 14.5 which indicates the address is between 14 Mile and 15 Mile roads.In the early days of Detroit-area house numbering, surveyors calculated position on the grid of mile roads to define addresses. The resulting system, adopted in 1921 and sometimes referred to as the Detroit Edison system, generally assigns 2000 addresses to each mile. (There are often gaps in the numbering; for instance, east addresses 9000 to 10999 and north addresses 2300 to 5599 [at Ford Road] are skipped). Typically, addresses of single family homes on adjacent lots on the grid system, both within Detroit and in the suburbs, are incremented by 8, 10, 12 or more rather than by 2 as is the case in most other large cities in the United States.


=== Pontiac grid ===
Pontiac and a number of surrounding communities have a separate grid, on which numbers ascend traveling away from the corner of Saginaw and Pike streets in downtown Pontiac. This system is used in Pontiac, Auburn Hills, Bloomfield Township, Bloomfield Hills, Waterford, Sylvan Lake, Keego Harbor, Orchard Lake Village, West Bloomfield, and portions of White Lake. Addresses on Woodward in these communities use the Detroit scheme.


=== Other independent numbering schemes ===
Though many suburbs also use the Detroit system, there are several that border those using the Detroit system that instead use their own numbering systems.

Rochester and Rochester Hills: numbers ascend on north–south roads traveling away from Walton Boulevard, and on east–west roads traveling away from Main Street/Rochester Road.Clawson and Troy: numbers ascend on north–south roads traveling away from 14 Mile, and on east–west roads traveling away from Main Street/Livernois Road.
Birmingham: numbers ascend on north–south roads traveling away from Maple Road, and on east–west roads traveling away from Old Woodward Avenue. Addresses on Woodward use the Detroit scheme.
Berkley: numbers ascend on north–south roads traveling north from 11 Mile, and on east–west roads traveling west from Woodward. Addresses on Woodward use the Detroit scheme.
Royal Oak: numbers ascend by 100 every block (roughly 350 feet [110 m]) on north–south roads traveling away from 11 Mile, and on east–west roads traveling away from Main Street. Addresses on Woodward use the Detroit scheme.
Pleasant Ridge: numbers ascend on north–south roads traveling south from I-696, and on east–west roads traveling away from Woodward. Addresses on Woodward use the Detroit scheme.
Ferndale: numbers ascend on north–south roads traveling north from 8 Mile, and on east–west roads traveling away from Woodward. Addresses on Woodward use the Detroit scheme.
Northville: numbers ascend on north–south roads traveling away from Main Street, and on east–west roads traveling away from Center Street.
Plymouth: numbers ascend on north–south roads traveling away from the alignment of Church and Union streets, and on east–west roads traveling away from Lilley Road/Mill Street.
Belleville: numbers ascend traveling away from the intersection of Main, South, Columbia, and Huron River Drive.
Grosse Pointe Farms and Grosse Pointe Shores: numbers ascend on northeast-southwest roads traveling away from Fisher Road, and on northwest-southeast roads traveling away from Lake St. Clair.
River Rouge: numbers ascend on north–south roads traveling south from the Rouge River, and on east–west roads traveling away from Jefferson. Addresses on Jefferson use the Detroit scheme.
Ecorse and Lincoln Park: numbers ascend on north–south roads traveling south from the cities' northern borders, and on east–west roads traveling away from Jefferson. The two cities use the same scheme for east–west roads, but different numbers for north–south roads.
Wyandotte: numbers ascend on north–south roads traveling south from the Ecorse River, and on east–west roads traveling west from the Detroit River.
Trenton: numbers ascend on north–south roads traveling south from Sibley Road, and on east–west roads traveling west from the Detroit River.

Detroit's Mile Roads (History Detroit 1701–2001)","The Detroit metropolitan area in southeast Michigan is served by a comprehensive network of roads and highways. Three primary Interstate Highways pass through the region, along with three auxiliary Interstates, and multiple state and U.S. Highways. These are supplemented by the Mile Road System, a series of local roads spaced one mile apart on a perpendicular grid.
 Many of the grid's east-west roads are known by numbers, such as 8 Mile Road, the system's baseline and Detroit's northern border.",Detroit's northern border is 8 Mile Road.,1
Neve Shalom Synagogue massacre,"The Neve Shalom Synagogue massacre happened on 6 September 1986 when a group of suspected Abu Nidal Organization terrorists killed 22 worshipers inside the Neve Shalom Synagogue in Istanbul, Turkey.


== Attack ==
The pair of gunmen stormed the synagogue around 9:17 in the morning of 6 September 1986, when the worshippers were reciting the Shabbat parasha. The terrorists entered on the men's side of the mechitza where they opened fire on the crowd with machine guns and then doused the bodies of the dead and injured with gasoline, which they lit on fire. Witnesses said they heard the gunmen speaking Arabic among themselves.
The attackers took out ""extremely powerful"" grenades and blew themselves apart, killing themselves and disfiguring their bodies so hard that investigators were unable to identify who they were.  The grenades set off a fire in the building that lasted several hours.
By the end of the massacre, 22 people had been killed. The victims ranged in age from 30 to 82.  Three of the people killed were Persian Jews, including an Iranian-born rabbi. Around two dozen were wounded, including four women hit by splinters in the women's gallery.


== Aftermath ==
Two previously unknown Lebanese groups both separately claimed responsibility for the massacre, but the authenticity of the claims have been doubted. The Palestinian Abu Nidal Organization, although it never claimed responsibility, was widely suspected of perpetrating the attack. Turkish police suspected the shooting was done by Abu Nidal but with the assistance of other groups, which it believed were likely Iran, Libya and Syria.All the victims were buried in the Ulus Ashkenazi Jewish Cemetery.


== Reactions ==
The Neve Shalom massacre was widely condemned in Turkey and internationally. The Cabinet of Turkey arranged a special session shortly after on Prime Minister Turgut Özal's orders, who described the incident as ""heinous"" and ""odious assault."" Jewish synagogues and institutions were provided heavy security in fear of another attack. President of the United States Ronald Reagan wrote a letter to the Jewish community of Istanbul sharply condemning the massacre.Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres denounced the attack as ""beastly"" and vowed ""not [to] rest until we cut off this murderous hand."" Simon Wiesenthal Center associate dean Abraham Cooper said the massacre was a ""resurrect[ion of] the imagery and savagery of the Holocaust.""

Ayaz İshaki,"Möxəmmətğayaz Ğiləcetdin ulı İsxaqi, in Turkish: Muhammed Ayaz İshaki (10 February 1878 — 22 July 1954) was a leading figure of the Tatar national movement, author, journalist, publisher and politician. The importance of İshaki to Tatar literature has been compared to what Pushkin and Tolstoy are to Russians. The most known story of İshaki's is the dystopian 200 yıldan soñ inqiraz (""Extinction in 200 years""). Among the plays often revered is Zöləyxa (1917), which focuses on forced baptism of his people.İshaki was the secretary of state of the short lived İdel-Ural. (1918). While he notably stated that ""Russia is a prison of nations"", he also (based on his early writings) felt that the so called national problem of the Tatars was in addition largely their own fault; ..""[a people] threatened with complete extinction due to their reluctance to follow progress, the Russian culture and renew their centuries-old customs"". İshaki himself was heavily influenced by Russian authors and aligned with the Jadid movement. According to researcher Azat Akhunov, İshaki believed that the progress of the Tatar nation was possible only in close cooperation with the Russian world, primarily its enlightened part. While living in İstanbul, İshaki actively corresponded with Maxim Gorky, who wanted to translate his works into Russian.Ayaz İshaki's daughter was the Turkologist Saadet Çağatay.


== Biography ==
İsxaqi (Ishakhov) was born in 1878 in the village of Yaushirma near Kazan to a Mishar Tatar parents, father Ğiläcetdin and mother Qamäriyä. İshaki was home-schooled by his father at an early age and was sent to study in a madrasah (religious school). He continued his education in the Russian-Tatar teachers' school (1898–1902).
İshaki moved to Kazan in 1904, where he became acquainted to socialists and adopted some of their views. He became involved in revolutionary activities, participated in an all-Muslim congress in 1905 and subsequently was arrested and sent to a prison near the city of Arkhangelsk in northern Russia in 1907.

After the February Revolution of 1917 he was involved in activities aimed at achieving cultural autonomy for the Volga Tatars and other Turkic peoples of Russia. As a result of his activities, the Soviet authorities started a campaign of harassment and persecution against him and his associates. He was forced to emigrate in 1920. After settling in Germany, İshaki started publishing a Tatar-language magazine Milli Yul (""The Way of the Nation"") in 1928. In 1931 he presided over the Independence Committee of the Muslims in Idel Ural.In 1939 the magazine was closed and İshaki decided to immigrate to Turkey. After World War II he became involved in political activities. At this stage his main goal was the restoration of the Tatar nationhood lost in 1552 when the Kazan Khanate was defeated and occupied by the Moscow Principality.
Throughout his life İshaki traveled to Poland, Germany, Japan, China and Turkey where he tried to establish Tatar-language press and unite disparate Tatar émigré communities. In Finland he spent time especially among the Tatar community of Tampere during 1930s. When İshaki organized a memorial service for Idel-Ural State in Warsaw, a few Finnish Tatars took part; among them Aisa Hakimcan and Gibadulla Murtasin.Ayaz İshaki died in 1954 and was buried in Edirnekapı graveyard of Istanbul.

HMS Surprise (novel),"HMS Surprise is the third historical novel in the Aubrey–Maturin series by Patrick O'Brian, first published in 1973. The series follows the partnership of Royal Navy Captain Jack Aubrey and his ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin during the wars against Napoleonic France.
In the story, Maturin's work as an intelligence agent gets him into trouble just as Aubrey takes command of a new ship, HMS Surprise. Later, the friends embark on a long voyage to bring an ambassador to Southeast Asia, rounding the southern tip of Africa.
The novel is often considered one of the best in the series. Some reviewers found it had ""superb depictions of life"", yet too full of nautical detail, while others found that detail part of the author's erudition and not in the way of the plot. The author showed ""capacity for creating another completely believable world"", while another reviewer said the novel is ""stretching its genre [naval adventure] but never escaping it.""


== Plot summary ==
Shortly after the events of Post Captain, the Admiralty debates the prize money to be awarded to Aubrey and the other captains of the convoy involved in the recent action off the coast of Portugal, in which several Spanish treasure ships were intercepted carrying the price of Spain's entry into the war on the side of France. On the quibble that Spain had not yet formally entered the war, the new First Lord of the Admiralty decides the vast sum is a ""Droit of the Admiralty"" and thus is not to be shared out with the captors. Jack is disheartened to hear that his reward will be much less than he and Sophia had expected. The First Lord also makes a blunder by mentioning the name of intelligence agent Stephen Maturin during the proceedings, putting Maturin at risk.
Unconcerned, Stephen goes on a mission to Minorca and arranges for Jack, still acting commander of HMS Lively and now on blockade duty near Toulon, to pick him up at Port Mahon. Lively pursues and burns a French supply ship, from which Jack gains valuable loot: a gunboat and a French signal book. When Stephen fails to show up at the rendezvous point, Jack learns from a Catalan revolutionary that his friend has been captured by French intelligence and is being held in Port Mahon in the former home of Admiral Harte, which Jack knows well. Jack and a rescue party use the captured gunboat and the French signals to slip into port unmolested. They storm the house and rescue Stephen, who has been brutally tortured, and kill most of the French interrogators.
Back in England, Stephen tries to recover his strength and the use of his flayed hands. Jack is taken by bailiffs and held in a sponging-house until he can pay off his debts. His marriage to Sophia Williams is deferred, as her mother insists that he be debt-free. Sir Joseph Blaine visits Stephen, who tells him of his capture and Aubrey's predicament, requesting that Jack be advanced his pending reward and released. Blaine promises to help, and also gives Aubrey command of a new ship, HMS Surprise. Before he embarks, Jack meets Sophia in a coach in the middle of the night, and they promise to marry no one else.
Aubrey and Maturin depart in the Surprise with orders to ferry an ambassador, Mr Stanhope, to the Sultan of Kampong on the Malay Peninsula. Stanhope almost immediately takes to his cabin with seasickness. Surprise is caught in the doldrums north of the equator, and the crew begins to show signs of scurvy. Stephen insists that they touch on the coast of Brazil to obtain fresh fruits. On a very hot Sunday, the doctor requests a boat for a quick visit to St. Paul's Rock, and Second Lieutenant Nicolls agrees to row him out. The rocky islet and the nearby Surprise are suddenly struck by intense squalls; Nicolls drowns and Stephen survives for two days on bird-fouled water and the blood of the resident boobies. A badly damaged Surprise recovers Stephen, who remarks that the days under the hot sun have restored his health after the torture. The ship then stops in Brazil for repairs. This is Stephen's first time in the New World, so he explores the jungle and returns with a sloth, which Jack introduces to alcohol. They also put in at Rio for mail, where Jack  learns that Admiral Linois, who once took him prisoner, is patrolling the Indian Ocean at the head of a French squadron.
Refitted and repainted, Surprise maintains a cautious distance while rounding the Cape of Good Hope, held by the Dutch who are allied with Napoleon. Nearing the waters of the Antarctic Ocean, Surprise endures a severe storm, and Stanhope becomes very ill. They put into Bombay in British India to refit after the storms and rest the ambassador. Stephen meets a local street child, a girl named Dil, who eagerly shows him around the city. He is watching a parade with Dil when he sees Diana Villiers, who has returned to Bombay ahead of her companion, the wealthy merchant Richard Canning. Stephen and Diana agree to visit, and spend several days together, at the end of which Stephen asks her to marry him. Diana does not give an answer but promises she will when Surprise stops in Calcutta. Stephen later finds Dil dead and her body looted of the valuables he had given her; he supervises her cremation on the shore.
Soon after the voyage resumes Stanhope becomes ill again. His condition grows more serious with each passing day, and before reaching the Sunda Strait they are compelled to find solid ground to help him recover. Pullings recommends a tiny beach surrounded by jungle, and they hastily bring the ambassador to it, where he dies a few hours later. Their mission now void, Surprise sets sail for home.
They encounter the East India Company's China Fleet, returning to England unescorted. A day after departing the fleet, Surprise spots Linois's squadron in the Indian Ocean. Surprise engages its smallest ship, the corvette Berceau, shredding her rigging; Jack bluffs by signaling to imaginary reinforcements beyond the horizon. Surprise pretends to be badly damaged while speeding back to the China Fleet to warn them and organise a defence. Though some of the merchant captains want to flee before Linois arrives, Jack convinces them that the only way out of the situation is to fight. The largest ships of the China Fleet are disguised as men-of-war and Jack distributes some of his officers to help them during the battle. As the French squadron closes on the Indiamen, Surprise engages Linois's warship, the Marengo; she is outgunned and in peril when one of the Indiamen suddenly engages the French ship from the other side, forcing Marengo to disengage. Damage forces Linois to abandon the chase in order to refit.
Ashore in Calcutta, Aubrey receives an enthusiastic welcome from the merchants, including Canning, who are happy to pay for Surprise's repairs. As a personal reward, Canning offers Jack the opportunity to transport a chest of jewels as freight, which will earn him a portion of the cargo's value upon his arrival in England. Knowing the money will be enough to clear the last of his debts so he can marry Sophia, he immediately writes to her, asking her to meet him in Madeira.
During the refit, Stephen asks Diana for her answer to his marriage proposal, but Canning suddenly appears. In a fit of jealousy he slaps Stephen, who responds by challenging him to a duel. Canning's shot hits Stephen in the ribs, but Stephen's hits Canning in the heart, killing him. Stephen convinces Diana to return to England on a merchant ship that will leave immediately rather than tend to him as he recovers aboard the Surprise. With the help of Aubrey, M'Alister, and a mirror, Stephen stoically operates on himself, removing the bullet lodged beneath his rib. Jack tends to his friend during the worst of his fever. In his delirium the usually private Stephen voices many of his thoughts and secrets.
Arriving at Madeira, Jack is dismayed to learn that Sophia is not there; Stephen finds a note from Diana returning the ring he gave her and explaining that she has travelled to America with a wealthy man named Johnstone, whom she has agreed to marry. Stephen is devastated. Within a day's sailing, Jack overtakes the frigate HMS Ethalion under his loyal friend Heneage Dundas and finds that Sophia is aboard. Jack wants to get married immediately, but Sophia insists they do it properly, when they return to England.

== Allusions to historical events ==
The capture of the Spanish treasure fleet, with Jack in command of HMS Lively, is based on the historical Action of 5 October 1804 (also known as the Battle of Cape Santa Maria), and is recounted at the end of the preceding novel Post Captain. In the fictionalized version, Aubrey replaces Captain Graham Hamond as acting commander of HMS Lively when Hamond is required to attend Parliament; in reality, Hamond was present during the battle. This battle also features in the 1962 novel Hornblower and the Hotspur, the last-published full-length novel in C. S. Forester's Horatio Hornblower series. Forester adds Hornblower in the Hotspur alongside the five British ships sent to intercept the fleet.At the opening of HMS Surprise, the Admiralty discusses what to do with the Spanish gold seized during the battle, for which the victorious British captains and their crews, including Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, expect a substantial share of the prize money, as was usual. However, the huge amount of bullion seized leads the Admiralty to declare it a droit belonging to the Admiralty itself, on the technicality that Spain had not yet legally declared war on England and therefore the treasure cannot be considered a war prize. The same result was also decided in real life, with the British captains receiving far smaller rewards than they might otherwise have won.
After he is advanced his reward and freed from the debtors' prison, Aubrey is given command of HMS Surprise, a fictional version of the historical HMS Surprise, with a different backstory. She becomes the most important fictional ship in the Aubrey–Maturin series.
The ""cutting out"" (capturing while in port, either at anchor or berthed) of HMS Hermione refers to an actual event involving HMS Surprise that occurred in 1799.
Aubrey's defense of the China Fleet against a French squadron under Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Léon Durand, Comte de Linois, in the Indian Ocean is a fictionalization of the real-life Battle of Pulo Aura in February 1804. In reality, the merchant ships of the East India Company defended themselves, without any King's ships escorting them. Commodore Nathaniel Dance gave the orders attributed to Aubrey, disguising several of the larger East Indiamen as Royal Navy men-of-war and forming the line of battle which successfully intimidated Linois into abandoning the pursuit after only a brief exchange of fire. Dance was celebrated for his aggressive tactics during the battle and later knighted for his heroism, while Linois was criticized for failing to capture the extremely valuable fleet.


== Reviews ==
Valerie Webster writing in The Scotsman found that ""His books can absorb and enthral landlubbers like myself who do not even know the difference between a jib-boom and a taffrail.""Library Journal reviewed this novel as part of an abridged audio edition, finding ""superb depictions of life"" and highly recommended it, mentioning ""O'Brian's exquisitely accurate historical detail"". Mark Pumphrery, writing for Library Journal, remarks the friendship of the Aubrey and Maturin, which ""plays out against an expanse of ocean, from India to the Atlantic, with a full complement of battles and adventures at sea for devotees of naval fiction.""Publishers Weekly liked the plot but, unlike the other reviewers, found the nautical detail sometimes overwhelming. They enjoy seeing the environment through Maturin's eyes, and appreciate what drives Aubrey to engage with French admiral Linois, as Aubrey wants enough prize money to marry his true love. In sum, ""Stretching its genre but never escaping it, the novel will impress those who enjoy swashbucklers.""Helen Lucy Burk writing in the Irish Press said ""Few, very few, books have made my heart thud with excitement. H.M.S. Surprise managed it. I read it cruising through the tame Adriatic, and several times found myself forced to pace about the deck to calm my pulse....Patrick O'Brian's erudition is phenomenal, as is his capacity for creating another completely believable world. He convinces with his total accuracy even in tiny details.""


== Adaptations ==

W W Norton issued a reprint in the USA 21 years after the initial publication as part of its reissue in paperback of all the novels in the series prior to 1991. Except for the 1973 Collins hardback and 1976 Fontana paperback UK editions above, the list of editions is drawn from Fantastic Fiction.The process of reissuing the novels initially published prior to 1991 was in full swing in 1991, as the whole series gained a new and wider audience, as Mark Howowitz describes in writing about The Nutmeg of Consolation, the fourteenth novel in the series and initially published in 1991.

Two of my favourite friends are fictitious characters; they live in more than a dozen volumes always near at hand. Their names are Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, and their creator is a 77-year-old novelist named Patrick O'Brian, whose 14 books about them have been continuously in print in England since the first, ""Master and Commander,"" was published in 1970.
O'Brian's British fans include T. J. Binyon, Iris Murdoch, A. S. Byatt, Timothy Mo and the late Mary Renault, but, until recently, this splendid saga of two serving officers in the British Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars was unavailable in this country, apart from the first few instalments which went immediately out of print. Last year, however, W. W. Norton decided to reissue the series in its entirety, and so far nine of the 14 have appeared here, including the most recent chapter, The Nutmeg of Consolation.

Browne House,"The Abraham Browne House (built c. 1694–1701) is a colonial house located at 562 Main Street, Watertown, Massachusetts, US. It is now a nonprofit museum operated by Historic New England and open to the public two afternoons per year.
The house was originally a modest one-over-one dwelling. The house features steep roofing and casement windows. During restoration works in 1919, details of 17th century finish were found. The ground floor consists of one large room that is used for living, cooking, and sleeping.By 1919 the house was nearly ruined when it was acquired by William Sumner Appleton, who in 1923 donated it to Historic New England. The house has grown by a series of enlargements but they occurred behind the original block, thus preserving the profile of the one-over-one elevation. The exception, a 19th-century addition, was removed before 1919. The Browne House is one of fewer than a half-dozen houses in New England to retain this profile.The Abraham Browne house was featured on PBS's This Old House television program.

Norwood Football Club,"Norwood Football Club, nicknamed the Redlegs, is an Australian rules football club competing in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) in the state of South Australia. Its home ground is Coopers Stadium (Norwood Oval), which is often referred to as ""The Parade"". It is one of the two traditional powerhouse clubs of the SANFL, the other being Port Adelaide, who together have won half of all SANFL premierships (see Port Adelaide–Norwood SANFL rivalry). The club has won 31 SANFL premierships and 1 SANFLW premiership.


== History ==


=== 1878–1899: Nineteenth-century powerhouse ===

The Norwood Football Club was formed at a meeting held at the Norfolk Arms Hotel in Rundle Street, Adelaide on 28 February 1878: it was resolved that the club colours would be those of the old Woodville Club.
At a subsequent meeting with 12 members present at the Norfolk Arms Hotel on 14 March the colours were confirmed as blue guernseys and knickerbockers, and red stockings and cap.
The new club gained a number of leading players from the then recently dissolved Woodville Football Club (1868–1877), including its Captain J.R. (Joe) Osborn who would become Norwood's inaugural Captain.Norwood's first home ground was the current CBC College oval in the east Park Lands near the tramway and opposite the Kent Town Brewery.
Norwood played their first SAFA match against South Adelaide at Adelaide Oval on 16 May 1878, who were the current reigning premiers from the inaugural season: Norwood went on to win the match 1 goal to nil, with future Australian Test cricketer and Captain George Giffen kicking Norwood's goal from a running kick. During this match the players donned distinctive red stockings which gave rise to the nickname 'Redlegs', the moniker which has remained synonymous with Norwood ever since.
Norwood won a premiership in its first year of existence and then followed with five more in a row. Only Port Adelaide in 1954–1959 has managed to repeat the feat of winning six premierships in a row. Norwood eventually won 11 pennants between 1878 and 1899 and was the most successful team of the 19th century. In 1883, after winning the pennant for the sixth successive year, Norwood became the first South Australian club to record a win over a Victorian team, when it defeated Essendon. In 1888, Norwood were proclaimed 'Premiers of Australia' when they defeated South Melbourne in three matches at Kensington Oval.
Norwood and Port Adelaide became famous rivals after a particularly tough match in 1894.
Early champions of the club include Alfred 'Topsy' Waldron, who captained the club for nine years; Alby Green, the first player to win the Magarey Medal for the best and fairest player in the competition in 1898; and Anthony 'Bos' Daly, who kicked 88 goals in 1893, including an astonishing 23 goals in one match. Daly's goal tally would not be surpassed for another 37 years, and his tally of 23 goals in one match has only ever been equalled by the great North Adelaide full forward goal kicker Ken Farmer in 1940. Daly was widely regarded as ""the greatest South Australian footballer from 1877 to the close of the nineteenth century"".


=== 1900–1915: pre-WWI era ===

The 1904 Grand Final was a memorable one for Norwood who were down by 35 points at three-quarter time against traditional rival Port Adelaide. Norwood then produced an extraordinary burst of football with a goal by centre half forward Dean Dawson followed by two goals each from full forward, Bill Miller and half forward flanker, Stan Robinson. Norwood was only two points down with a minute remaining. Tommy Gibbons held a mark on a seemingly impossible angle.  His kick sailed through the goal posts to give Norwood a four-point victory 9.8 to 8.10.

Norwood were proclaimed the Champions of Australia again in 1907 when they defeated the Victorian premier, Carlton, 13.12 to 8.9 after Norwood scored 7 goals in the first 20 minutes of the third quarter. Norwood would beat Carlton again in 1921, but on this latter occasion both clubs were runners up in their respective competitions.


=== 1919–1944: Interwar period and WWII competition ===


==== 1922–1924: Thomas Leahy success ====
For his brief coaching stint, Thomas Leahy proved remarkably successful, leading the Redlegs to back to back premierships in 1922 and 1923, a feat that would not be repeated for 90 years.


==== 1925–1929: Walter Scott era ====
Walter Scott was captain-coach of the Norwood Football Club for five years, leading his team to two grand finals in 1928 and 1929, winning the latter against Port Adelaide.


=== 1945–1956: Jack Oatey era ===
Over a coaching stint of 12 years, Jack Oatey led the Redlegs to three premierships in 1946, 1948, 1950.


=== 1957–1973: Premiership drought ===
The period spanning the 1951 and 1973 seasons, totalling twenty three years, was the club's longest without a premiership.


=== 1974–1979: Robert Hammond era ===


==== 1977: NFL night series premiers ====
Robert Hammond would lead the Redlegs to two premierships, one in 1975 and the other in 1978.
In 1977, Norwood defeated East Perth for the NFL night series premiership. Both of these clubs would later make bids to enter the VFL: East Perth in 1980 and Norwood in 1986. Norwood would go on to win the game 10.9 (69) to East Perth's 9.7 (61). This would be Norwood's third and last title in a national competition. Norwood were awarded $50,000  (equivalent to $313,547 in 2022) for their win.


==== 1978: 100 years of the Norwood Football Club ====
1978 was Norwood's centenary year and Sturt, heading into the grand final, had lost only one game for the year and was odds-on favourite to win its 8th flag in 13 years. Norwood was 29 points down at three-quarter time but scored seven goals to Sturt's two in the last quarter to win the premiership by one point. Memorable moments in the match include Neil Button's effort in ruck against Sturt's Rick Davies, John Wynne's charge into the Sturt coaches box, Michael Taylor's mark 1 metre out from Sturt's goal with a minute to go, Danny Jenkin's leaping smother of a shot for goal with just seconds left to play and Brian Adamson's five goals from centre half forward. However, the most controversial moment was when field umpire Des Foster awarded a mark to Norwood’s Phil Gallagher in the dying seconds of the final quarter, that resulted in a goal by Gallagher which gave Norwood a 1 point lead that would hold to the final siren.


=== 1980–1990: Neil Balme era ===
Under the leadership of Western Australian Neil Balme, the Redlegs won two premierships, one in 1982 and a second in 1984. The 1984 premiership was notable as the side came from 5th position at the end of the minor round to win the Grand Final, the first time a team outside the top four had won the competition. Two distinguished Norwood players from this era are Michael Aish and Garry McIntosh.


=== 1991–1997: National League expansion ===


==== 1991–1995: Neil Craig era ====
With the formation of the Adelaide Crows, the number of the SANFL's best players leaving the competition skyrocketed. The Norwood Football Club was hit particularly hard just avoiding the wooden spoon in successive years. However to the credit of Neil Craig, he managed to make do with what was at his disposal and in his third year as senior Redlegs coach the side made the 1993 Grand Final. However, timing was to be unfortunate and the Redlegs found themselves up against the recently created Woodville-West Torrens Eagles who were by far the strongest team of the year, losing by a club record 73 points.


==== 1996–1999: Peter Rohde era ====
The Norwood Football Club entered the 1997 SANFL season, helmed by coach Peter Rohde, with purpose and rage that would see it dominate the years competition. During the home-and-away season, the club lost only three games during the minor round with a percentage of 64.82%, second to only that of Port Adelaide's 1914 season percentage of 68.78%. The dominance of Norwood during this year was highlighted on ANZAC day when Norwood played the second-placed team of the year, Port Adelaide, winning by 122 points. However, during the second semi-final, Norwood lost to Port Adelaide. The loss proved to be a wake-up call for a side seemingly winning with ease.

 The following week, a win over Central District saw them make the Grand Final, where again they would play Port Adelaide, this time in front of 44,161 eager spectators. Norwood were no longer complacent like they had been a couple weeks ago, and they dished out Port Adelaide's greatest-ever grand final defeat in the SANFL, winning by 73 points, 19.12 (126) to 7.11 (53). With midfielders Anthony Harvey (Jack Oatey Medallist), John Cunningham and Andrew Jarman playing superbly, the Redlegs had their Magpie opponents chasing shadows all afternoon. Norwood's victory, which came during the same season Port Adelaide's controversial bid to enter the AFL came to fruition, meant the satisfaction it generated amongst Redleg supporters was euphoric.


=== 2000–2009: Tough times ===
The euphoria of the 1997 grand final victory would be short-lived, with the club only making it to another grand final once in the next decade, losing to Port Adelaide. The decade would see club revenue reduced to its minimum extent as the AFL took an economic hold of football in the state. During this time, the club picked up its 6th wooden spoon and its first for over three decades.


=== 2010–2013: Nathan Bassett and Norwood resurgence ===
Norwood won their 28th and 29th SANFL premierships in 2012 and 2013 by defeating West Adelaide and North Adelaide respectively and lost only five minor-round games over those two years (two in 2012, three in 2013). It was the first time in 90 years (1922 and 1923) that the club had won back-to-back premierships. By coincidence, Norwood defeated Wests in 1922 and North in 1923.


=== 2014–2016: Ben Warren as coach ===

In his first season as coach Ben Warren, with recruiting restrictions due to a salary cap breach and the loss of 12 premiership players, managed to guide the club to a Grand Final, in which Norwood defeated its biggest rival by 4 points, Norwood 12.10 (82) Port Adelaide 11.12 (78), in front of the largest Grand Final crowd for 15 years of 38,644. The win was significant given that the Port Adelaide team of 21 included 19 full-time professional AFL-listed players. It was also Norwood's 30th premiership, and completed a hat-trick following on from its 2012 and 2013 flags. The victory left Norwood as the team that won both the last Grand Final at Football Park and the first Grand Final at the newly refurbished Adelaide Oval.
In 2015, Norwood started the season 9–1 despite losing their captain Kieran McGuinness to retirement along with Gavin Hughes over the off-season, Anthony Wilson to the Adelaide Crows and Steven Baldasso suffering a season ending knee injury during the pre-season. The Redlegs were top of the ladder after Round 10 but a loss to bottom side Glenelg in round 11 would prove pivotal as they fell away in the second half of the season to only win 2 of their remaining 9 games with an horrific run of injuries to key players. They finished 4th after the minor round with 11–7, equal third with West Adelaide, but with inferior percentage were sent to an Elimination Final and were bundled out by 44 points by Central District.
The 2016 season saw the Redlegs regain Andrew Kirwan from overseas, Matt Fuller, Anthony Wilson and Jaryd Cachia from AFL duties but this did not cover the losses of James Allan, Michael Newton, Liam Davis and Mat Suckling, all to retirement, with Andrew McInnes and Mitch Wilkins returning to Melbourne after only one year and Kane Murphy returning to Sydney. The Redlegs started well with a win over archrivals, Port Adelaide, at Coopers Stadium by 25 points with Simon Phillips copping a season ending shoulder injury. A shock loss to North Adelaide by 57 points was the start of things to come as the Redlegs struggled with many injuries throughout the year which started with Michael Chippendale missing for the first six weeks and then significant injuries to key players in Bode, Panos, Cachia, Phillips and Webber throughout the year saw the Redlegs struggle without their star players. Norwood managed to win three of their last six games of the season with a shock win over ladder leaders, Woodville-West Torrens, by 24 points at Coopers Stadium which was the Redlegs stand out game in a poor season. This led to the departure of their Senior Coach, Ben Warren, with both parties not being able to come to an agreement over the club's future. Ben Warren ended with a win–loss record of 31–27.


=== 2017–present: Evolution ===
Norwood were a foundation member of the SANFL Women's (SANFLW) competition in 2017. They claimed their first (and currently only) premiership in the competition in the inaugural 2017 season.


== Tradition ==
The Norwood Football Club is one of two traditional power-house clubs in the South Australian National Football League, the other team being the Port Adelaide Football Club. As a result, their rivalry was the biggest in South Australian sport for over 100 years before the arrival of the Showdown. The two clubs still consistently attract the largest crowds during the SANFL minor round.


=== Current club song ===


==== It's a grand old flag ====

It's a grand old flag, it's a high flying flag It's the emblem for me and for you It's the emblem of the team we loveThe team of the Red and the Blue.Every heart beats true for the Red and the BlueAs we sing this song to you (What do we sing?)Should auld acquaintance be forgotKeep your eye on the Red and the Blue.Oh the team played fine in the year twenty nineThe Redlegs that no-one could lick, lick, lickFrom the crowds first yell to the final bellThe spirit of old forty six, six, six.Every heart beats true for the Red and the BlueAs we sing this song to you (What do we sing?) Should auld acquaintance be forgotKeep your eye on the Red and the Blue.It's a grand old flag, it's a high flying flagIt's the emblem for me and for you It's the emblem of the team we loveThe team of the Red and the Blue.Every heart beats true for the Red and the BlueAs we sing this song to you (What do we sing?)Should auld acquaintance be forgotKeep your eye on the Red and the Blue.

==== Men of Norwood ====

All who love the noble game, hear the story I proclaim; 
How the Norwoods earned their fame [How they won their glory]. 
First, against the Souths so strong, Cheers went up, both loud and long; 
Forward! Norwoods, red and blue. Fair ones' smiles encourage you.
Chorus
Cheer the bonny red and blue,
Cheer the colours fast and true,
Keep their colours still in view,
Forward! Men of Norwood.
Who will e'er forget that day, Sturdy Mac led on the play, 
Giffen dashing through the fray, Kicked first goal for Norwood? 
And from thousand throats that cried, Cleft the air up to the skies. 
Forward! Norwood, red and blue. Fair ones' eyes are watching you.
(Chorus)
When they met the sprightly Vics, With their little marks and tricks, 
People thought would be a fix, Too much for the Norwoods. 
Like the Souths the Vics were licked, Traynor for us one goals kicked. 
Forward! Norwoods, red and blue, Wiry Vics you did subdue.
(Chorus)
Sturdy Ports and Adelaides, Little Parks [those knowing blades] 
Kensingtons, who love the maids, All succumbed to Norwood. 
So the first year passed away, And our men still held the sway; 
Forward! Norwood, red and blue, Beauty's lips are praising you.

== Hall of Fame ==
In 2006, the Norwood Football Club board wrote a charter to establish a club Hall of Fame and Hall of Fame Committee, with the express purpose of ""recognis[ing] and enshrin[ing] players, coaches, volunteers, honorary officials and administrators who have made a most significant contribution to the Norwood Football Club since its inception in 1878."" The Hall of Fame Committee were tasked with selecting a maximum of 30 members for the inaugural induction ceremony, with up to 25 players and up to five coaches, volunteers, honorary officials or administrators from across the broad history of Norwood. Like other SANFL clubs, the charter initially adopted the practice of using broad historical eras to categorize members; in the case of Norwood, five eras were outlined: a) 1878 to 1906; b) 1907 to 1941; c) 1946 to 1969; d) 1970 to 1990; and e) 1991 and onwards. The Committee were also tasked with expanding the Hall of Fame by admitting up to five new members each year. There are currently 63 members in the Norwood Hall of Fame. In 2018, five of those members were upgraded to Legend status. The categorization below follows that of the club's history website, Redlegs Museum.

Official website","Norwood Football Club, nicknamed the Redlegs, is an Australian rules football club competing in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) in the state of South Australia. Its home ground is Coopers Stadium (Norwood Oval), which is often referred to as ""The Parade"".

Black Forest Fire,"The Black Forest Fire was a forest fire that began near Highway 83 and Shoup Road in Black Forest, Colorado around 1:00 p.m. on June 11, 2013. As of June 20, 2013, the fire was 100 percent contained, 14,280 acres (22.31 sq mi; 57.8 km2) were burned, at least 509 homes were said to be destroyed, and two people had died. This was the most destructive fire in the state's history at the time, surpassing the 2012 Waldo Canyon Fire which also began near Colorado Springs. It was surpassed in 2021, when the Marshall Fire destroyed over 1,000 homes in Boulder County, in Superior and Louisville.The evacuation area covered 94,000 acres (147 sq mi; 380 km2) acres, 13,000 homes and 38,000 people. Three shelters were established in the area, including Elbert County Fairgrounds, which accepted humans, pets, and large animals. Two other shelters were designated for large animals only.
On June 13, the Denver Post reported, 457 firefighters were working the fireline, including agencies around the fire, the Colorado Air National Guard, and select personnel from fire suppression teams on Fort Carson and the nearby United States Air Force Academy. Of note, 3 x UH-60 and 3 x CH-47 from 2-4 GSAB along with some crews from 3-4 AHB (4th Combat Aviation Brigade) were instrumental in providing immediate response to assist in fighting the fires.  The Battalion, commanded by LTC Tyler Smith, launched with very little notice to provide much needed support to the Front Range region.  One of the CH-47D aircraft ""Patches"", was involved in the effort on every day.  Governor John Hickenlooper addressed Emergency Managers at the command post on June 12.  U.S. Northern Command assisted with fire fighting efforts.


== Background and ignition ==
Record setting heat in the region, and a Red Flag Warning from the National Weather Service set the stage for an explosive fire situation. In the early afternoon hours of Tuesday, June 11, 2013, beginning before 2:00 p.m. MDT, reports of a wildfire in the Black Forest area reached 9-1-1 dispatchers. The initial 9-1-1 call came from Gregg Cawlfield, reporting a small structure fire. Cell phone video he captured shows the fire started as a small, localized event. The record heat and high winds quickly spread the flames to several hundred acres. As of June 20, the investigation into the cause and timeline of events continued.The National Weather Service in Pueblo, Colorado issued notices for severe fire weather starting at 2:00 p.m. on June 12, with low humidity, high winds, and temperatures approaching 90 °F (32 °C) expected to drive the fire. As of 4:50 a.m., the evacuation area stood at 55 square miles, with firefighters from agencies around the state of Colorado being mobilized, as well as helicopters and military aircraft.
In the afternoon hours of June 12, the fire exploded in size driven by dry winds, jumping fire lines and spreading out to the east, north, and west. Evacuation areas were expanded from El Paso County into Douglas and Elbert Counties, and west to Interstate 25. Some evacuation shelters were forced to evacuate due to smoke.
Firefighters experienced additional frustrations with intrusions of road closures on Highway 83, Walker Road, and Evans Road, according to scanner traffic observed by The Gazette. Also observed by reporters over the scanner were instances of news media helicopters violating closed airspace above the fire, creating hazardous situations and the potential for an air disaster.Heavy smoke being pushed by the south/south-easterly winds covered most of the populated areas of Douglas County and pushed into other Denver suburbs.
Fire investigators confirmed that lightning had been ruled out as a cause of the fire. The investigation centers just north of Shoup Road near Darr Drive, an area with many homes in a heavily wooded area.


== Destruction ==
Within 2 days of ignition, the Black Forest fire surpassed the previous year's Waldo Canyon fire as the most destructive fire in Colorado history. El Paso County Sheriff Terry Maketa stated that at least 360 homes had been lost and 15,000 acres had burned as of the June 13 morning briefing. It was also released that 1,205 homes were still unaffected by the fire, and 38,000 residents had been evacuated from 13,000 homes so far. The National Weather Service predicted a third day of hot, dry, windy weather for the fire area, especially in late afternoon. Isolated thunderstorms were expected.
Already the most destructive fire in Colorado history, the fire remained at zero containment throughout the day with weather forecasts showing no natural relief in sight.
By late Thursday morning, the fire had also severed the broadcast transmission line for 740 AM KVOR, which operates a transmitter in the evacuation zone. As a result, crews were unable to enter the area to repair the transmission line. The Gazette reported that KVOR moved to 1300 AM, a sister station.
By 5:00 p.m., containment of the fire increased to five percent, and the acreage increased to 15,700 acres (24.5 sq mi; 64 km2). Sheriff Terry Maketa reported two fatalities were discovered, and the victims appeared to have died while attempting to evacuate their home. Dry lightning and thunderstorms were also reported forming in the area, including one sparking a brief-lived sister fire north of Cripple Creek.
Maketa announced on Friday morning that 19 more homes burned, totaling 379 and in the evening, his office further updated this number to 419.


== Containment ==
Firefighters were able to make some important gains the evening of Friday, June 14, when some cloud cover and rain moved into the area, bringing containment to 30 percent that night.It was announced in the early morning hours of Saturday, June 15 that the sheriff's office had updated some information at midnight, including the number of homes burnt rising to 473 and containment of the blaze rising to 30 percent. By evening, KOAA reported the fire as 55 percent contained and the number of houses destroyed as 483.On Sunday, June 16 the Denver Post reported that the fire was 65 percent contained and the number of homes destroyed had climbed to 485. The burned area was downgraded from 15,000 to 14,198 acres due to better mapping.  The firefighting costs had reached $5.2 million.At 7:30 p.m. June 16, the Sheriff's office released new data on the number of homes affected: 3,633 unaffected, 483 total loss, and 17 with partial damage. Due to lessons learned from the Waldo Canyon Fire, a publicly accessible list of affected homes was published by the Sheriff's office and updated on a regular basis, using the same web address to reflect ongoing updates to this data in real time. At 8:00 p.m., more areas that were on mandatory evacuation were changed to pre-evacuation status to allow residents in those areas to return home.As of Friday, June 22, the number of homes lost had risen to 511.


== Residents return ==
As of 10:00 a.m. Thursday, June 20, the Sheriff's office allowed residents to return to most of the burn area, though a small area including Darr Circle, Falcon Drive, Peregrine Way and the adjacent section of Shoup Road continued to be closed to residents and the public due to an ongoing crime scene investigation.In an interview at noon Thursday, which was announced to be the last press conference for the Black Forest fire with 100 percent containment expected by that night, Sheriff Maketa announced that while area residents were allowed to reenter their property as of that morning, the area would not be opened to the general public until Saturday.


== Aftermath ==
As of Friday, June 21, the fire was completely contained, but the total number of homes lost had risen to 509, and Sheriff Maketa stated that the assessed value of the lost homes totaled about $90 million. The number was revised upward the next day to 511 homes lost. As of June 20, 2013, the cost for fighting the fire was estimated at $9,323,955.At the completion of the first of four parts of the Black Forest assessment in early July, the El Paso County Accessor's office reported that the fire destroyed 486 homes — fewer than the sheriff's department's initial estimate of 511 — and damaged 37, causing $85,444,052 in damage.    Sixteen members of the office, who have been working full-time on the fire, must now put dollar amounts to lost outbuildings, commercial structures and, perhaps most costly, trees. A treeless lot sells for about 30 percent less than one with pristine trees, and buyers will pay about 15 percent less for a lot with damaged trees. The assessor's office came up with its totals after on-site inspections of 2,400 parcels. ""We will probably have to review Black Forest in a year or two because we have no guarantee that those trees that were damaged are going to make it,"" county assessor Mark Lowderman said.
Authorities continued to investigate the cause of the fire, which killed a married couple, Marc Allen Herklotz, 52, and his wife, Robin Lauran Herklotz, 50, who were attempting to flee the area. The bodies were discovered Thursday June 13 in what was the garage of a home that the blaze had leveled. They were next to a car with its doors open. The car's trunk was packed full of belongings. The sheriff's office, which said the fire's cause was not natural, has executed search warrants and conducted interviews.

Dayco,"Dayco Products, formerly known as Mark IV Industries, is an American parts supplier for construction, automotive, and industrial companies. The companies annual earnings are approximately US$150 million.  Its main customers include Caterpillar and General Motors.


== History ==
Dayco was founded in 1905 as Dayton Rubber Manufacturing Co. by Col. J. C. Hooven in Ohio. The company initially made products such as garden hoses out of natural rubber. In 1908, the company hired John A. MacMillan, and began creating his product, the airless tire. The company also produced the first whitewall tires in 1913. Beginning in the early 1920s, the company entered a diversification period when it radically increased the variety of its products. Dayco would eventually make many different rubber parts, as well as some textiles. It also pioneered some synthetic rubber products, including developing the first synthetic rubber tire. The company would be a valuable supplier of military products during World War II. The company officially changed its name to the DAYCO Corporation in 1960.


== Controversies ==
Dayco filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2009, and emerged from bankruptcy approximately 6 months later.  It eliminated about $750 million in debt during the bankruptcy. In 2015, Dayco attracted controversy when it announced it would be closing its two Distribution Centers in North Carolina  and one in Nevada.  Dayco was consolidating into its Memphis, Tennessee Distribution Facility.  The move attracted media attention and resulted in several hundred jobs being lost.

Balance (2013 book),"Balance: The Economics of Great Powers from Ancient Rome to Modern America, known colloquially as Balance is a non-fiction economic history text written by former US intelligence officer and economist Captain Tim Kane and economist Glenn Hubbard. While criticized for its brevity across a wide range of historical matters, it has become an often cited text in the debate around American Isolationism and fiscal policy.


== Summary ==
The text's principal concern is why economic imbalances have historically caused civil collapse, and asks whether The United States could experience a similar decline. The book summarizes the fall of a range of civilizations, including the Ming Dynasty, Ottoman Turkey and Imperial Spain, and reflects on the resulting patterns within their socioeconomic, military and political policies.From this, Kane and Hubbard introduce a new measure of economic power, based around fiscal balance, national debt and social spending. The text is particularly critical of heavy regulation on internal employment, markets and trade, highlighting the limits of the Japanese model of growth, including an ageing population. The book concludes with a comparison of the twenty-first century United States to former fallen civilizations, and the challenges Americans face in order to address what Kane and Hubbard regard as ""dysfunctional fiscal imbalance"".


== Reception ==
The book received mixed to positive reviews during the initial release, with The New York Times describing the book's analysis of imperial history as ""one-dimensional"" but praising the book's overall focus on domestic issues as ""dead-on"". The Financial Times described the book as ""a readable, data-rich history of the fall of great powers through the eyes of two fiscally troubled US conservatives in 2013.""The book has found success in political debate circles, and is often cited within other socioeconomic texts and analysis.

Utah dual language immersion,"Utah's dual language immersion program was created in 2008 to help students achieve proficiency in a second language in preparation for future careers and the global economy. In the early school years, the students are immersed for half a day in a target language – Mandarin Chinese, French, Spanish, Portuguese, or German – and half a day in English. In high school, students can participate in a bridge program, allowing them to take language classes that would give them concurrent college credit at certain universities throughout Utah. Over 160 schools in Utah participate in the program. Proven benefits include an increased performance on standardized tests, fluency in a target language, and an increased cultural awareness and sensitivity.


== Background ==
Senate Bill 80 (S.B. 80), The Critical Languages Program, sponsored by Senator Howard Stephenson, was passed in 2007, leading to the creation of initiatives that established a Governor's World Language Council; the Utah World Language Roadmap; and eventually the passing of S.B. 41 International Initiatives in 2008, the last of which led to the creation of Utah's dual language immersion program.


== Goals ==
The program's goal is to help students achieve a high enough proficiency level in a second language to be used in a future career as they become participants in a global economy.  Languages available in the program include Spanish, Portuguese, Mandarin Chinese, French, and German. Plans are being made to add Russian and Arabic to the program.


== Model ==
The students are immersed in a foreign language for half of the day, and in English for the other half.
In the immersion language half of the day for grades 1-3, students spend 20% of their school day learning math; 15% in Social stud, Science, Physical Education (P.E.), Art, Health, and Music; and 15% of their day in the target language literacy. For the other half of the day, students spend most of their time in English Language Arts, with the remaining 15% of the school day in English reinforcement of the subjects learned in their immersion language.
In grades 4 and 5, the percentage changes: 25% of the day is spent learning Math and Science in the immersion language, 25% in immersion language literacy, 25% in English Language Arts, 25% in Math and Social Studies in English, while Music, Art, P.E., and Health are taught in both languages.In sixth grade, the learning schedule is mostly the same as in grades 4 and 5, but with a switch; the science and social studies classes have now switched places. Science is now taught in English, and Social Studies is now taught in the immersion language.In the junior high years, students spend more time learning in English, but must take two courses taught in the immersion language: a world languages class, and either Foundations of Social Studies, Health/Humanities, or World Geography.Beginning in Fall 2016, high school students who pass an AP language course and exam in ninth grade will have the option to enroll in the Bridge Program, where they can enroll in one of three courses per school year that, if passed, will award them with concurrent upper-division university credit, leaving students only two credits shy of a minor in their immersion language by the time they arrive at the university. Seven of Utah's universities are involved in this Bridge Program. It began first with the University of Utah, but has expanded to include Brigham Young University, Utah State University, Weber State University, Utah Valley University, Southern Utah University, and Utah Tech University.


== Participating districts ==
The school districts that offer this dual language immersion program, covering 163 schools statewide, include:
Several charter schools are also involved in the DLI program, in Lehi (Chinese), Bluffdale (German), Spanish Fork (Spanish), and Layton (Spanish), Utah.The program is expanding by 20 to 25 schools every year. Most classes in the program are for English-native speakers. However, in areas of the state where there is a higher concentration of Spanish-speaking immigrants, an English Language immersion-style program is available.Utah's DLI program has inspired similar dual language immersion programs throughout the United States, in places like Arizona, Idaho, Wyoming, and South Carolina.


== Benefits ==
Along with second language skills, proven benefits of the DLI program include improved performance on standardized tests, where they perform better, or as well as, students on in an immersion program; increased cultural sensitivity as they become more aware of other world cultures; and more.It is not only the language that the students are immersed in, but the culture as well. In schools where Mandarin is taught, for example, Chinese lanterns decorate the halls, Taiwanese music is played, and native food, like dumplings and pot stickers, is served in the cafeterias. In one school where Spanish is taught, classrooms are decorated with flags from Spanish-speaking countries, posters of Spanish artists, and clocks that show the time in those countries.

Faraj ben Salim,"Faraj ben Sālim (Arabic: فرج بن سالم, Hebrew: פרג' בן סלומון), also known as Farragut of Girgenti, Moses Farachi of Dirgent, Ferragius, Farragus, or Franchinus or Ferrauto, was a Sicilian-Jewish physician and translator who flourished in the second half of the thirteenth century.


== Work ==
He was engaged by Charles I of Anjou as translator of medical works from Arabic into Latin. In this capacity he rendered a great service to medicine by making in 1279 a Latin translation of Abu Bakr al-Razi's medical encyclopedia, Al-Hawi (later printed in 1486, under the title Continens, with a glossary by the translator). The translation is followed, between the same covers, by De expositionibus vocabulorum seu synonimorum simplicis medicinæ, which Moritz Steinschneider supposes to form a part of the Continens. As a token of his esteem for the translator, Charles of Anjou ordered that on the original copy of the manuscript of the Continens (MS. Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris, No. 6912) the portrait of Faraj should be drawn beside his own by friar Giovanni of Monte Cassino, the greatest illuminator of his time.
Faraj also translated De medicinis expertis, attributed to Galen and included in the printings of his works by the Giuntas (Venice, 1565: x. 103–109) and René Chartier (Paris, 1679: x. 561–570); and Tacuini Ægritudinum (Tables of Disease, Arabic: Taqwim al-Abdan) by ibn Jazla, published at Strasbourg in 1532. Steinschneider believes that to Faraj should also be ascribed the Latin translation of Masarjawaih's treatise on surgery (MS. Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, No. 7131), said to have been made by a certain Ferrarius.


== Translations ==

Faraj b. Sālim also translated the De medicinis Expertis,attributed to Galen and included in his works.
Another work was the Tacuini Aegritudinum, (Arabic: Taqwīm al-abdān)by Ali ibn Jazla, published in Strasbourg in 1532.
Translated into Sicilian by Faraj was the Tacuinis sanitatis (Tables of Diseases,Arabic Taqwīm al-ṣiḥḥa) whose author was Ibn Buṭlān, a work illustrated with representations of plants in their natural environment, plants of scientific and non-scientific interest within an agricultural calendar.
Steinschneider believes that Faraj should be credited with the Latin translation of Masawayh'sTreatise on, stating that it was prepared by a certain Ferrarius of Girgenti.

Topolino,"Topolino (from the Italian name for Mickey Mouse) is an Italian digest-sized comic series featuring Disney comics. The series has had a long running history, first appearing in 1932 as a comics magazine. It is currently published by Panini Comics.


== Topolino giornale (1932–1949) ==
In 1932 the editor Mario Nerbini decided to open a new weekly newspaper for kids, containing illustrated tales with Mickey Mouse. The first issue of Topolino was published on December 31, 1932: it contained Mickey's first Italian story drawn by Giove Toppi. In this story, Mickey Mouse was chased by an elephant. However, Nerbini had not correctly secured the publication rights, so when Emmanuel (Disney's representative in Italy) protested, Nerbini changed the title of the comic book with issue #3 into Topo Lino (Mouse Lino), replacing Mickey Mouse with Topo Lino, another mouse. When Nerbini bought the publication rights from Disney and King Features Syndicate, he changed the title back to Topolino with issue #5. Floyd Gottfredson's stories made their debut in Topolino #7 with a Sunday page featuring Mickey, his girlfriend Minnie Mouse, and Mickey's nephews Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse. Topolino published mainly Mickey Mouse Sunday pages; the daily strips were published in the supplement to the newspaper.
Topolino had eight pages and also published non-Disney comic strips such as Tim Tyler's Luck (Cino e Franco). In 1935 Topolino published Bobo the Elephant, Mickey Mouse and the sacred jewel and Mickey Mouse and Pluto the racer. The same year Arnoldo Mondadori's publishing house Mondadori bought the newspaper; the first issue published by Mondadori was #137.
In 1937 Topolino and I tre porcellini, Mondadori's newspapers for kids, merged into Topolino - Grandi avventure (""Mickey Mouse - Great adventures""). The page count increased from eight to sixteen. The first page published a story in instalments by Floyd Gottfredson starring Mickey Mouse and his friends; the other pages published American stories such as Tim Tyler's Luck as well as Italian stories such as Saturno contro la Terra, a story by Federico Pedrocchi in which Rebo (the dictator of Saturn, who later appeared as Donald Duck's enemy in four Italian stories drawn by Luciano Bottaro) made his debut. December 1937 also saw the publication of a companion newspaper, Paperino e altre avventure (Donald Duck and Other Adventures), which ran for three years before being merged with Topolino in October 1940.

In 1938, Mussolini's fascist government forbade the publishing of American stories except Disney stories (his children liked Mickey Mouse, and delayed the ban as long as possible). Topolino continued to publish Mickey Mouse stories until February 3, 1942 (#477, containing the last episode of Mickey Mouse in love trouble) when they were forced by the fascist government to stop publishing Mickey's stories. For two years, Mickey Mouse was replaced by Tuffolino, a human character very similar to Mickey.  Tuffolino made his debut in Tuffolino agente di pubblicità, a remake (starring non-Disney characters) of American story Mickey Mouse, super salesman (1941). Tuffolino and his friends (Mimma, Clara) very much resembled Mickey, Minnie and Clarabelle Cow. Tuffolino's stories were written by Pedrocchi and drawn by Pier Lorenzo De Vita. The newspaper had to cease all publications in December 1943 (#564).
In December 1945, Mondadori resumed publication of Topolino. Because of the fall of fascism in Italy, Mondadori could once again publish Mickey Mouse stories by Floyd Gottfredson. Topolino also began publishing Donald Duck stories by Carl Barks. Topolino #713 published the first episode of Topolino e il cobra bianco, written by Guido Martina and drawn by Angelo Bioletto; this was the first long Italian story to be published in the newspaper. In 1949, Mario Gentilini, Topolino's director, decided to convert the newspaper into a pocket comic book containing only Disney stories. The last issue of Topolino (giornale) was #738; on April 10, 1949 the first issue of Topolino digest (libretto) format was released.


== Topolino libretto ==
Topolino started as a monthly comic book, and the first issue was released on April 10, 1949: it had 100 pages and its price was 60 lire. The first issue contained the final part of Topolino e il cobra bianco, the first episode of Gottfredson's Mickey Mouse and the man of Tomorrow (the story where Eega Beeva makes its debut), a Carl Barks ten-pager where Gladstone Gander makes his second appearance (though it's the first story with the character to be published in Italy), the long story Pluto Saves the Ship, written by Barks, Jack Hannah and Nick George and drawn by an unidentified illustrator, the first episode of a long Barks story (The Old Castle's Secret, where Scrooge McDuck makes his second appearance), and many stories about minor characters like Br'er Rabbit, Li'l Bad Wolf, etc.
Mickey's Inferno (L'inferno di Topolino), written by Guido Martina and drawn by Angelo Bioletto, was the second Italian story to be published on Topolino (#7-12): a satiric retelling of Dante Aligheri's Inferno, the panels of the comic also have a poem, written using hendecasyllables in terza rima, describing what's happening in each scene. Mickey's Inferno was the first Italian Great Parody and the first Disney story featuring credits, albeit partially: in the first panel, under the title of the story, it is written ""verseggiatura di G. Martina"", meaning ""verses by G. Martina""; however, Martina was only credited for the poem and not for also writing the story, while Bioletto's work was similarly uncredited. The third Italian story to be published was Topolino e i grilli atomici (literally Mickey Mouse and the atomic crickets, #13-16), written by Martina and drawn by Bioletto: for the latter, it was his third and last Disney work. However Topolino published mainly American stories by Carl Barks, Floyd Gottfredson, Paul Murry and others and in 1951 the periodical published only American stories.
In 1952, the comic book became biweekly, and Italian stories increased. Italian stories were written mainly by Guido Martina, who wrote the first great parodies of the classics of literature: in 1956 he wrote Paperino Don Chisciotte (a parody of Don Quixote) and in 1957 he wrote Paperin di Tarascona (parody of Tartarin of Tarascon), Paperino e il conte di Montecristo (parody of The Count of Monte Cristo) and Paperino e i tre moschettieri (parody of The Three Musketeers); these stories were drawn by skillful artists such as Pier Lorenzo De Vita and Luciano Bottaro. These parodies were successful among the readers, so many other writers such as Carlo Chendi, Dalmasso, Missaglia and Romano Scarpa began to write parodies. The duo Chendi (writer)-Bottaro (artist) wrote many great parodies such as Dr. Paperus (parody of Dr. Faustus), Paperino il paladino, Paperin Furioso (parody of Orlando Furioso by Ariosto), and Paperino e il tesoro di Papero Magno. One of these parodies, Paperin Meschino (Martina/De Vita, 1958), revealed why Donald is persecuted by bad luck (Paperin meschino, one of his ancestors (he lived in the 15th century), was cursed by a witch: ""You and all your descendents will be persecuted by bad luck for 1000 years!"").
Romano Scarpa wrote and drew many masterpieces such as Paperino e i gamberi in salmì, Topolino e l'unghia di Kali (English: ""Kali's Nail""), Topolino e la dimensione delta (""Mickey Mouse in the Delta Dimension""), Topolino e la collana chirikawa, Topolino imperatore della calidornia, Paperino e le lenticchie di Babilonia (""The Lentils from Babylon""), Paperin Hood. He also created many new characters such as Atomo Bleep-Bleep (Atomino Bip Bip), Trudy Van Tubb (Peg Leg Pete's girlfriend), and Brigitta MacBridge, a female duck enamoured of Scrooge (though the feelings are unrequited). Rodolfo Cimino was initially Scarpa's inker; later he became a skillful writer. He wrote many stories about Scrooge's treasure hunts. He also created Reginella, an alien female duck enamoured of Donald Duck; unfortunately, their love is impossible.
In 1960, Topolino became a weekly. In 1969, Guido Martina created Paperinik (Duck Avenger), the superheroic alter ego of Donald Duck. Inspired by the then-popular fictional character Diabolik as well as Fantômas, Paperinik was originally the diabolic avenger of Donald Duck, and he originally committed criminal acts, i.e., stealing Uncle Scrooge's money, in order to avenge Donald (Scrooge said to Donald ""you aren't able to steal not even a nut from a squirrel""). As this was not considered a good role model for Topolino's young readers, he soon became a superhero, especially reminiscent of Batman.
Giorgio Pezzin was another skillful Italian writer. He wrote many sagas, i.e. I signori della galassia (The Lords of Galaxy, a sort of parody of Star Wars), C'era una volta in America (Once Upon a time in America, a far west saga that tells the story of the United States through the lives of Mickey's ancestors) and The Time machine saga. In the time machine saga Mickey Mouse and Goofy are sent back in time through a time machine by Professor Zapotec and Professor Marlin of Mouseton's museum in order to resolve the great mysteries of history (i.e. ""Why did Napoleon always put his hand in his pocket?"").
Massimo De Vita was the son of Pier Lorenzo De Vita. He drew many stories. He wrote also some stories, such as the Ice Sword Saga starring Mickey and Goofy in a fantasy word threatened by the ""Lord of the Mists"". Another skillful artist was Giovan Battista Carpi, who drew masterpieces such as Paperino missione Bob Fingher (Donald Duck mission Moldfinger, a great parody of the James Bond film Goldfinger, known in Italian as Agente 007 - Missione Goldfinger, ""Agent 007 - Mission Goldfinger"") and Paperinik il diabolico vendicatore. He also wrote and drew some stories, such as the great parodies Guerra e pace (War and Peace) and Zio Paperone e il mistero dei Candelabri (parody of Les Misérables by Victor Hugo).
Casty is another writer and artist. Some of his stories featuring Mickey Mouse have been published in the United States in Walt Disney's Comics and Stories and in Mickey Mouse.

In 2016 he was one of the subjects of the exhibition Workshop and Legacy: Stanley William Hayter, Krishna Reddy, Zarina Hashmi at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.


== Career ==


=== Printmaking ===
Reddy was considered a master in intaglio printmaking and after 1965 was an associate director at Hayter's Atelier 17. Atelier 17, a thriving artist workshop was founded in 1927 by Hayter and was originally located in Paris; however between 1939 and 1940 the workshop moved to New York City and in 1950 back to Paris. Atelier 17 has always been a meeting place to experiment with their art practices for both European and American artists including Joan Miró, Pablo Picasso, Alberto Giacometti, Juan Cardenas, Constantin Brâncuși, and Zarina Hashmi.Reddy's technique and style distinguished him as an important printmaker. Reddy's prints are abstract, created with subtle grid-like designs on plates with intricate texturisations. The myriad complex colours that he introduced in prints are marked by a contemplative approach to the infinite mysteries of nature. While working at Atelier 17, Reddy was instrumental in developing a new printing process to produce multi-coloured prints from a single printing matrix by exploiting the viscosity and tackiness of the inks, subsequently named viscosity printing. Reddy would later teach the viscosity etching technique at Robert Blackburn (artist)'s Printmaking Workshop in New York.Reddy received the Padma Shri award in 1972, in recognition of his distinguished contributions to art.


=== Teaching ===
Reddy was a guest professor and lecturer at many universities in the United States including Maryland Institute College of Art, Pratt Institute, Ruskin College School of Fine Art and Drawing, University of Texas and many more.Among Reddy's pupils is the painter and printmaker Kathleen Mary Spagnolo and Elaine Breiger.Krishna Reddy died on 22 August 2018 in New York, at the age of 93.

South Extension is also home to two tombs from the Mughal era. The Bade and Chote Khan’s twin tombs in South Extension are preserved in pretty good shape. They form part of one of the major components of the Kotla Mubarakpur complex, which includes several other lesser known tombs, mostly from the pre-Mughal era, belonging to various kings and noblemen of the notable Lodi and Sayyid dynasties. ""Bade Khan Ka Gumbad"" is slightly bigger of the two tombs, it dates back to the 16th century, as per archaeologists.
The front is intricately carved, while the centre is surrounded by three rows of niches. The central niche in each row is larger than the other two. It looks like a typical Lodhi-era tomb with octagonal turrets at the corners covered by umbrella type structures at the top. The interiors were once intricately crafted, but now they look a bit worn out. The structure is supported by four massive pillars on all four corners.

Portuguese conjugation,"Portuguese verbs display a high degree of inflection. A typical regular verb has over fifty different forms, expressing up to six different grammatical tenses and three moods. Two forms are peculiar to Portuguese within the Romance languages:

The personal infinitive, a non-finite form which does not show tense, but is inflected for person and number.
The future subjunctive, is sometimes archaic in some dialects (including peninsular) of related languages such as Spanish, but still active in Portuguese.It has also several verbal periphrases.


== Overview ==
Portuguese verbs have the following properties.

Two numbers—singular, plural
Three persons—first, second, third
Three aspects—perfective, imperfective, progressive*
Two voices—active, passive*
Six morphological forms for tenses, aspects, and/or moods—present, preterite, imperfect, pluperfect, future, and conditional.
Three (or four) moods—indicative, subjunctive, imperative (and conditional, according to some authors)Classes with an asterisk are entirely periphrastic. The passive voice can be constructed in two different ways. The pluperfect and the future of the indicative mood, as well as the conditional form, are often replaced with other verbal constructions or verbal periphrases in the spoken language.


== Basic tenses and moods ==
Conjugation is demonstrated here with the important irregular verb fazer, ""to do"":

Periphrastic forms are as follows:


=== Notes ===


=== Description ===
The tenses correspond to:

Present (presente): ""I do"" or ""I am doing"".
Preterite (pretérito, or pretérito perfeito): ""I did"" or ""I have done"".
Imperfect (imperfeito, or pretérito imperfeito): ""I did"", ""I used to do"", ""I was doing"".
Pluperfect (mais-que-perfeito, or pretérito mais-que-perfeito): ""I had done"".
Future (futuro, or futuro do presente in Brazilian Portuguese): ""I will do"", ""I am going to do"".
Conditional (condicional, or futuro do pretérito in Brazilian Portuguese): ""I would do"". Used in some types of conditional sentences, as a form of courtesy, or as a future-in-the-past.The five non-finite forms generally correspond to:

(Impersonal) infinitive (infinitivo, or infinitivo impessoal): equivalent to English ""to do"".
Past participle (particípio, or particípio passado): equivalent to English ""done"".
Present participle (particípio presente): Uncommon in modern speech. Somewhat equivalent to English ""doer"", or used as an adjective relating to an ongoing action, or that action in general. For example, ""falante"" can mean ""talking (+ noun)"", ""talkative"" or ""speaker"". See notes above.
Gerund (gerúndio): equivalent to English ""(is) doing"". Used to actually show/describe  ongoing action.
Personal infinitive (infinitivo pessoal): ""(for me) to do"", an infinitive which inflects according to its subject; a rare feature that Portuguese shares with Galician.The moods are used roughly as follows:

Indicative (indicativo): for factual statements or positive beliefs. Example of an English equivalent: ""I have done"".
Subjunctive (subjuntivo, or conjuntivo): mostly used when speaking of unreal, uncertain, or unassumed conditions: ""Were I to do"".
Imperative (imperativo): for direct commands or requests; equivalent to the English ""Do!""For the Portuguese personal pronouns (which are omitted whenever they can be inferred from the ending of the conjugated verb or the context), see Portuguese personal pronouns and possessives.


== Conjugations ==
Regular verbs belong to one of three conjugation classes, distinguished by the ending of their infinitive forms (which is also their citation form):

Those whose infinitive ends in -ar belong to the first conjugation (e.g. lavar, matar, ladrar);
Those whose infinitive ends in -er belong to the second conjugation (e.g. correr, comer, colher);
Those whose infinitive ends in -ir belong to the third conjugation (e.g. partir, destruir, urdir);The verb pôr is conventionally placed in the second conjugation by many authors, since it is derived from Old Portuguese poer (Latin ponere). In any event, this is an irregular verb whose conjugation must be learned on its own. Other verbs with infinitives ending in -or, such as depor, compor, and propor are derivatives of pôr, and are conjugated in the same way.


=== First conjugation (cantar) ===


=== Second conjugation (comer) ===


=== Third conjugation (partir) ===


=== Quick reference ===


== Important irregular verbs ==
The following irregular verbs are used as auxiliary verbs in various periphrastic constructions.


=== ter – to have ===


=== estar – to be ===


=== ser – to be ===


=== haver – to have, to happen, there to be ===


=== pôr - to put ===


== Conditional and future ==
There are few irregular verbs for these tenses (only dizer, fazer, trazer, and their compounds – also haver, ter, ser, ir, pôr, estar, etc. – for the subjunctive future imperfect). The indicative future imperfect, conditional, and subjunctive future imperfect are formed by adding to the infinitive of the verb the indicative present inflections of the auxiliary verb haver (dropping the h and av), the 2nd/3rd conjugation endings of the preterite, imperfect, and the personal infinitive endings, respectively. Thus, for the majority of verbs, the simple personal infinitive coincides with subjunctive future.


== Imperative ==
The affirmative imperative for second person pronouns tu and vós is obtained from the present indicative, by deletion of the final -s (in some cases, an accent mark must be added to the vowel which precedes it). For other persons, and for negative clauses, the present subjunctive takes the role of imperative.


== Pronunciation of present inflections ==
In the present tense, the stress fluctuates between the root and the termination. As a rule of thumb, the last radical vowel (the one that can be stressed) will retain its original pronunciation when unstressed (atonic) and change into [a], [e/ɛ] (subjunctive or indicative 1st pers sing/infinitive), or [o/ɔ] (subjunctive or indicative 1st pers sing/infinitive) – depending on the vowel in question – in case it is stressed (is in a tonic syllable). Other vowels (u, i) and nasalized vowels (before closed syllables) stay unchanged, as well as the verbs with the diphthongs -ei, -eu, -oi, -ou; they always keep a closed-mid pronunciation; e.g. deixo /ej/ (deixar), endeuso /ew/ (endeusar), açoito /oj/ (açoitar), roubo /ow/ (roubar), etc. Alternation in stem-stressed forms is blocked when a nasal consonant (/m/, /n/ or /ɲ/) follows, in which case the higher alternant (i.e. /ɐ/, /e/ or /o/) is used in all forms. For example, in the verb comer, all of the forms como, comes, come, comem have /o/.
Example: Consider the conjugation of correr (analogous to comer, presented above) in the Indicative Present Simple. The first-person singular corro has [o] in the stressed vowel, while other forms corres, corre, correm have [ɔ].
In Brazil, the following difference applies: Stem-unstressed forms consistently have /o/ or /e/ for most speakers in most verbs, but there are exceptions, with some dialects (e.g. northeastern Brazilian dialects) likely to present an open form /ɔ/ or /ɛ/. At times, the difference is not particularly clear, producing [o̞], [e̞], particularly in transition zones like the states of Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais and the Brazilian Federal District, unless vowel harmony is involved (e.g. comove ""move, touch (emotionally)"" [kɔˈmɔvi]).
This also has repercussions in the imperative and present subjunctive, for their inflections are constructed from the indicative present simple and indicative present simple in the 1st singular person respectively.

Conus princeps,"Conus princeps, common name the prince cone, is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of ""stinging"" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.


== Description ==
The size of the shell varies between 31 mm and 130 mm. The low shell has a distantly but distinctly tuberculated spire, and direct sides, slightly striate at the base. Its color is yellowish brown, orange or pink, sometimes without markings, but usually with irregular longitudinal chestnut or chocolate striations most of which are continuous from spire to base. They vary from fine and close to heavier and more distant markings. The interior is yellow or pink. The epidermis is dark brown, fibrous, with distant revolving series of tufted spots.
The broad-striped state is Conus regius; that with the stripes obsolete is Conus lineolatus.


== Distribution ==
This species occurs in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Central America, from the Gulf of California (Mexico) to Northern Peru.

Caílte mac Rónáin,"Caílte (or Modern Irish Caoilte) mac Rónáin was a nephew of Fionn mac Cumhaill, a warrior and a member of the fianna in the Fenian Cycle of Irish mythology. He is described as being able to run at remarkable speed and communicate with animals, and was a great storyteller. Some poems of the Fenian Cycle are attributed to Caílte.
In the short Middle Irish tale Finn and Gráinne, his ancestry is given as ""son of Oisgen or Conscen, the son of the Smith of Múscraige Dobrut; a son he of Cumall's daughter.""
Caílte's most celebrated fellow survivor was Oisín: according to Cath Gabhra (The Battle of Gabhra), Caílte and Oisín are the only members of the fianna to survive that final battle. They are both central figures in the tale Acallam na Senórach (Colloquy of the Ancients), in which they survive into Christian times and recount tales of the Fianna to a recently arrived Saint Patrick.
In Irish mythology, Cas Corach was a hero who helped Caílte mac Rónáin kill three werewolf-like creatures, the daughters of Airitech who would come out of the Cave of Cruachan every year around Samhain and destroy sheep. The she-wolves liked music, so he aided in their slaying by playing a harp to attract and distract them and by persuading them to change to human form, while Caoilte cast a spear that penetrated all three, thereby killing them.
He had the sword Cruadh-Chosgarach, the Hard Destroying One.
The 'Bodb Dearg', god in fianna time who is the son of the Dagda had a daughter called Scathniamh. She and Cailte loved each other. But they were forced to part from one another, and they never met again till the time Caoilte was old and withered, and one of the last that was left of the Fianna.

Human impact on the environment,"Human impact on the environment (or anthropogenic environmental impact) refers to changes to biophysical environments and to ecosystems, biodiversity, and natural resources caused directly or indirectly by humans. Modifying the environment to fit the needs of society (as in the built environment) is causing severe effects including global warming, environmental degradation (such as ocean acidification), mass extinction and biodiversity loss, ecological crisis, and ecological collapse. Some human activities that cause damage (either directly or indirectly) to the environment on a global scale include population growth, neoliberal economic policies and rapid economic growth, overconsumption, overexploitation, pollution, and deforestation. Some of the problems, including global warming and biodiversity loss, have been proposed as representing catastrophic risks to the survival of the human species.The term anthropogenic designates an effect or object resulting from human activity. The term was first used in the technical sense by Russian geologist Alexey Pavlov, and it was first used in English by British ecologist Arthur Tansley in reference to human influences on climax plant communities. The atmospheric scientist Paul Crutzen introduced the term ""Anthropocene"" in the mid-1970s. The term is sometimes used in the context of pollution produced from human activity since the start of the Agricultural Revolution but also applies broadly to all major human impacts on the environment. Many of the actions taken by humans that contribute to a heated environment stem from the burning of fossil fuel from a variety of sources, such as: electricity, cars, planes, space heating, manufacturing, or the destruction of forests.


== Human overshoot ==


=== Overconsumption ===

Overconsumption is a situation where resource use has outpaced the sustainable capacity of the ecosystem. It can be measured by the ecological footprint, a resource accounting approach which compares human demand on ecosystems with the amount of planet matter ecosystems can renew. Estimates indicate that humanity's current demand is 70% higher than the regeneration rate of all of the planet's ecosystems combined. A prolonged pattern of overconsumption leads to environmental degradation and the eventual loss of resource bases.
Humanity's overall impact on the planet is affected by many factors, not just the raw number of people. Their lifestyle (including overall affluence and resource use) and the pollution they generate (including carbon footprint) are equally important. In 2008, The New York Times stated that the inhabitants of the developed nations of the world consume resources like oil and metals at a rate almost 32 times greater than those of the developing world, who make up the majority of the human population.
Human civilization has caused the loss of 83% of all wild mammals and half of plants. The world's chickens are triple the weight of all the wild birds, while domesticated cattle and pigs outweigh all wild mammals by 14 to 1. Global meat consumption is projected to more than double by 2050, perhaps as much as 76%, as the global population rises to more than 9 billion, which will be a significant driver of further biodiversity loss and increased Greenhouse gas emissions.


=== Population growth and size ===

Some scholars, environmentalists and advocates have linked human population growth or population size as a driver of environmental issues, including some suggesting this indicates an overpopulation scenario. In 2017, over 15,000 scientists around the world issued a second warning to humanity which asserted that rapid human population growth is the ""primary driver behind many ecological and even societal threats."" According to the Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, released by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services in 2019, human population growth is a significant factor in contemporary biodiversity loss. A 2021 report in Frontiers in Conservation Science proposed that population size and growth are significant factors in biodiversity loss, soil degradation and pollution.Some scientists and environmentalists, including Pentti Linkola, Jared Diamond and E. O. Wilson, posit that human population growth is devastating to biodiversity. Wilson for example, has expressed concern when Homo sapiens reached a population of six billion their biomass exceeded that of any other large land dwelling animal species that had ever existed by over 100 times.However, attributing overpopulation as a cause of environmental issues is controversial. Demographic projections indicate that population growth is slowing and world population will peak in the 21st century, and many experts believe that global resources can meet this increased demand, suggesting a global overpopulation scenario is unlikely. Other projections have the population continuing to grow into the next century. While some studies, including the British government's 2021 Economics of Biodiversity review, posit that population growth and overconsumption are interdependent, critics suggest blaming overpopulation for environmental issues can unduly blame poor populations in the Global South or oversimplify more complex drivers, leading some to treat overconsumption as a separate issue.Advocates for further reducing fertility rates, among them Rodolfo Dirzo and Paul R. Ehrlich, argue that this reduction should primarily affect the ""overconsuming wealthy and middle classes,"" with the ultimate goal being to shrink ""the scale of the human enterprise"" and reverse the ""growthmania"" which they say threatens biodiversity and the ""life-support systems of humanity.""


== Fishing and farming ==

The environmental impact of agriculture varies based on the wide variety of agricultural practices employed around the world. Ultimately, the environmental impact depends on the production practices of the system used by farmers. The connection between emissions into the environment and the farming system is indirect, as it also depends on other climate variables such as rainfall and temperature.

There are two types of indicators of environmental impact: ""means-based"", which is based on the farmer's production methods, and ""effect-based"", which is the impact that farming methods have on the farming system or on emissions to the environment. An example of a means-based indicator would be the quality of groundwater that is affected by the amount of nitrogen applied to the soil. An indicator reflecting the loss of nitrate to groundwater would be effect-based.The environmental impact of agriculture involves a variety of factors from the soil, to water, the air, animal and soil diversity, plants, and the food itself. Some of the environmental issues that are related to agriculture are climate change, deforestation, genetic engineering, irrigation problems, pollutants, soil degradation, and waste.


=== Fishing ===

The environmental impact of fishing can be divided into issues that involve the availability of fish to be caught, such as overfishing, sustainable fisheries, and fisheries management; and issues that involve the impact of fishing on other elements of the environment, such as by-catch and destruction of habitat such as coral reefs. According to the 2019 Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services report, overfishing is the main driver of mass species extinction in the oceans.These conservation issues are part of marine conservation, and are addressed in fisheries science programs. There is a growing gap between how many fish are available to be caught and humanity's desire to catch them, a problem that gets worse as the world population grows.Similar to other environmental issues, there can be conflict between the fishermen who depend on fishing for their livelihoods and fishery scientists who realize that if future fish populations are to be sustainable then some fisheries must reduce or even close.The journal Science published a four-year study in November 2006, which predicted that, at prevailing trends, the world would run out of wild-caught seafood in 2048. The scientists stated that the decline was a result of overfishing, pollution and other environmental factors that were reducing the population of fisheries at the same time as their ecosystems were being degraded. Yet again the analysis has met criticism as being fundamentally flawed, and many fishery management officials, industry representatives and scientists challenge the findings, although the debate continues. Many countries, such as Tonga, the United States, Australia and New Zealand, and international management bodies have taken steps to appropriately manage marine resources.The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) released their biennial State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture in 2018 noting that capture fishery production has remained constant for the last two decades but unsustainable overfishing has increased to 33% of the world's fisheries. They also noted that aquaculture, the production of farmed fish, has increased from 120 million tonnes per year in 1990 to over 170 million tonnes in 2018.Populations of oceanic sharks and rays have been reduced by 71% since 1970, largely due to overfishing. More than three-quarters of the species comprising this group are now threatened with extinction.


=== Irrigation ===

The environmental impact of irrigation includes the changes in quantity and quality of soil and water as a result of irrigation and the ensuing effects on natural and social conditions at the tail-end and downstream of the irrigation scheme.
The impacts stem from the changed hydrological conditions owing to the installation and operation of the scheme.
An irrigation scheme often draws water from the river and distributes it over the irrigated area. As a hydrological result it is found that:

the downstream river discharge is reduced
the evaporation in the scheme is increased
the groundwater recharge in the scheme is increased
the level of the water table rises
the drainage flow is increased.These may be called direct effects.
Effects on soil and water quality are indirect and complex, and subsequent impacts on natural, ecological and socio-economic conditions are intricate. In some, but not all instances, water logging and soil salinization can result. However, irrigation can also be used, together with soil drainage, to overcome soil salinization by leaching excess salts from the vicinity of the root zone.Irrigation can also be done extracting groundwater by (tube)wells. As a hydrological result it is found that the level of the water descends. The effects may be water mining, land/soil subsidence, and, along the coast, saltwater intrusion.
Irrigation projects can have large benefits, but the negative side effects are often overlooked.Agricultural irrigation technologies such as high powered water pumps, dams, and pipelines are responsible for the large-scale depletion of fresh water resources such as aquifers, lakes, and rivers. As a result of this massive diversion of freshwater, lakes, rivers, and creeks are running dry, severely altering or stressing surrounding ecosystems, and contributing to the extinction of many aquatic species.


=== Agricultural land loss ===

Lal and Stewart estimated global loss of agricultural land by degradation and abandonment at 12 million hectares per year. In contrast, according to Scherr, GLASOD (Global Assessment of Human-Induced Soil Degradation, under the UN Environment Programme) estimated that 6 million hectares of agricultural land per year had been lost to soil degradation since the mid-1940s, and she noted that this magnitude is similar to earlier estimates by Dudal and by Rozanov et al. Such losses are attributable not only to soil erosion, but also to salinization, loss of nutrients and organic matter, acidification, compaction, water logging and subsidence. Human-induced land degradation tends to be particularly serious in dry regions. Focusing on soil properties, Oldeman estimated that about 19 million square kilometers of global land area had been degraded; Dregne and Chou, who included degradation of vegetation cover as well as soil, estimated about 36 million square kilometers degraded in the world's dry regions. Despite estimated losses of agricultural land, the amount of arable land used in crop production globally increased by about 9% from 1961 to 2012, and is estimated to have been 1.396 billion hectares in 2012.Global average soil erosion rates are thought to be high, and erosion rates on conventional cropland generally exceed estimates of soil production rates, usually by more than an order of magnitude. In the US, sampling for erosion estimates by the US NRCS (Natural Resources Conservation Service) is statistically based, and estimation uses the Universal Soil Loss Equation and Wind Erosion Equation. For 2010, annual average soil loss by sheet, rill and wind erosion on non-federal US land was estimated to be 10.7 t/ha on cropland and 1.9 t/ha on pasture land; the average soil erosion rate on US cropland had been reduced by about 34% since 1982. No-till and low-till practices have become increasingly common on North American cropland used for production of grains such as wheat and barley. On uncultivated cropland, the recent average total soil loss has been 2.2 t/ha per year. In comparison with agriculture using conventional cultivation, it has been suggested that, because no-till agriculture produces erosion rates much closer to soil production rates, it could provide a foundation for sustainable agriculture.Land degradation is a process in which the value of the biophysical environment is affected by a combination of human-induced processes acting upon the land. It is viewed as any change or disturbance to the land perceived to be deleterious or undesirable. Natural hazards are excluded as a cause; however human activities can indirectly affect phenomena such as floods and bush fires. This is considered to be an important topic of the 21st century due to the implications land degradation has upon agronomic productivity, the environment, and its effects on food security. It is estimated that up to 40% of the world's agricultural land is seriously degraded.


=== Meat production ===

Environmental impacts associated with meat production include use of fossil energy, water and land resources, greenhouse gas emissions, and in some instances, rainforest clearing, water pollution and species endangerment, among other adverse effects. Steinfeld et al. of the FAO estimated that 18% of global anthropogenic GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions (estimated as 100-year carbon dioxide equivalents) are associated in some way with livestock production. FAO data indicate that meat accounted for 26% of global livestock product tonnage in 2011.Globally, enteric fermentation (mostly in ruminant livestock) accounts for about 27% of anthropogenic methane emissions, Despite methane's 100-year global warming potential, recently estimated at 28 without and 34 with climate-carbon feedbacks, methane emission is currently contributing relatively little to global warming. Although reduction of methane emissions would have a rapid effect on warming, the expected effect would be small. Other anthropogenic GHG emissions associated with livestock production include carbon dioxide from fossil fuel consumption (mostly for production, harvesting and transport of feed), and nitrous oxide emissions associated with the use of nitrogenous fertilizers, growing of nitrogen-fixing legume vegetation and manure management. Management practices that can mitigate GHG emissions from production of livestock and feed have been identified.Considerable water use is associated with meat production, mostly because of water used in production of vegetation that provides feed. There are several published estimates of water use associated with livestock and meat production, but the amount of water use assignable to such production is seldom estimated. For example, ""green water"" use is evapotranspirational use of soil water that has been provided directly by precipitation; and ""green water"" has been estimated to account for 94% of global beef cattle production's ""water footprint"", and on rangeland, as much as 99.5% of the water use associated with beef production is ""green water"".
Impairment of water quality by manure and other substances in runoff and infiltrating water is a concern, especially where intensive livestock production is carried out. In the US, in a comparison of 32 industries, the livestock industry was found to have a relatively good record of compliance with environmental regulations pursuant to the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act, but pollution issues from large livestock operations can sometimes be serious where violations occur. Various measures have been suggested by the US Environmental Protection Agency, among others, which can help reduce livestock damage to streamwater quality and riparian environments.Changes in livestock production practices influence the environmental impact of meat production, as illustrated by some beef data. In the US beef production system, practices prevailing in 2007 are estimated to have involved 8.6% less fossil fuel use, 16% less greenhouse gas emissions (estimated as 100-year carbon dioxide equivalents), 12% less withdrawn water use and 33% less land use, per unit mass of beef produced, than in 1977. From 1980 to 2012 in the US, while population increased by 38%, the small ruminant inventory decreased by 42%, the cattle-and-calves inventory decreased by 17%, and methane emissions from livestock decreased by 18%; yet despite the reduction in cattle numbers, US beef production increased over that period.Some impacts of meat-producing livestock may be considered environmentally beneficial. These include waste reduction by conversion of human-inedible crop residues to food, use of livestock as an alternative to herbicides for control of invasive and noxious weeds and other vegetation management, use of animal manure as fertilizer as a substitute for those synthetic fertilizers that require considerable fossil fuel use for manufacture, grazing use for wildlife habitat enhancement, and carbon sequestration in response to grazing practices, among others. Conversely, according to some studies appearing in peer-reviewed journals, the growing demand for meat is contributing to significant biodiversity loss as it is a significant driver of deforestation and habitat destruction. Moreover, the 2019 Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services by IPBES also warns that ever increasing land use for meat production plays a significant role in biodiversity loss. A 2006 Food and Agriculture Organization report, Livestock's Long Shadow, found that around 26% of the planet's terrestrial surface is devoted to livestock grazing.


=== Palm oil ===

Palm oil is a type of vegetable oil, found in oil palm trees, which are native to West and Central Africa. Initially used in foods in developing countries, palm oil is now also used in food, cosmetic and other types of products in other nations as well. Over one-third of vegetable oil consumed globally is palm oil.


==== Habitat loss ====
The consumption of palm oil in food, domestic and cosmetic products all over the world means there is a high demand for it. To meet this, oil palm plantations are created, which means removing natural forests to clear space. This deforestation has taken place in Asia, Latin America and West Africa, with Malaysia and Indonesia holding 90% of global oil palm trees. These forests are home to a wide range of species, including many endangered animals, ranging from birds to rhinos and tigers. Since 2000, 47% of deforestation has been for the purpose of growing oil palm plantations, with around 877,000 acres being affected per year.


==== Impact on biodiversity ====
Natural forests are extremely biodiverse, with a wide range of organisms using them as their habitat. But oil palm plantations are the opposite. Studies have shown that oil palm plantations have less than 1% of the plant diversity seen in natural forests, and 47–90% less mammal diversity. This is not because of the oil palm itself, but rather because the oil palm is the only habitat provided in the plantations. The plantations are therefore known as a monoculture, whereas natural forests contain a wide variety of flora and fauna, making them highly biodiverse. One of the ways palm oil could be made more sustainable (although it is still not the best option) is through agroforestry, whereby the plantations are made up of multiple types of plants used in trade – such as coffee or cocoa. While these are more biodiverse than monoculture plantations, they are still not as effective as natural forests. In addition to this, agroforestry does not bring as many economic benefits to workers, their families and the surrounding areas.


==== Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) ====
The RSPO is a non-profit organisation that has developed criteria that its members (of which, as of 2018, there are over 4,000) must follow to produce, source and use sustainable palm oil (Certified Sustainable Palm Oil; CSPO). Currently, 19% of global palm oil is certified by the RSPO as sustainable.
The CSPO criteria states that oil palm plantations cannot be grown in the place of forests or other areas with endangered species, fragile ecosystems, or those that facilitate the needs of local communities. It also calls for a reduction in pesticides and fires, along with several rules for ensuring the social wellbeing of workers and the local communities.


== Ecosystem impacts ==


=== Environmental degradation ===

Human activity is causing environmental degradation, which is the deterioration of the environment through depletion of resources such as air, water and soil; the destruction of ecosystems; habitat destruction; the extinction of wildlife; and pollution. It is defined as any change or disturbance to the environment perceived to be deleterious or undesirable. As indicated by the I=PAT equation, environmental impact (I) or degradation is caused by the combination of an already very large and increasing human population (P), continually increasing economic growth or per capita affluence (A), and the application of resource-depleting and polluting technology (T).According to a 2021 study published in Frontiers in Forests and Global Change, roughly 3% of the planet's terrestrial surface is ecologically and faunally intact, meaning areas with healthy populations of native animal species and little to no human footprint. Many of these intact ecosystems were in areas inhabited by indigenous peoples.


=== Habitat fragmentation ===

According to a 2018 study in Nature, 87% of the oceans and 77% of land (excluding Antarctica) have been altered by anthropogenic activity, and 23% of the planet's landmass remains as wilderness.Habitat fragmentation is the reduction of large tracts of habitat leading to habitat loss. Habitat fragmentation and loss are considered as being the main cause of the loss of biodiversity and degradation of the ecosystem all over the world. Human actions are greatly responsible for habitat fragmentation, and loss as these actions alter the connectivity and quality of habitats. Understanding the consequences of habitat fragmentation is important for the preservation of biodiversity and enhancing the functioning of the ecosystem.Both agricultural plants and animals depend on pollination for reproduction. Vegetables and fruits are an important diet for human beings and depend on pollination. Whenever there is habitat destruction, pollination is reduced and crop yield as well. Many plants also rely on animals and most especially those that eat fruit for seed dispersal. Therefore, the destruction of habitat for animal severely affects all the plant species that depend on them.


=== Mass extinction ===

Biodiversity generally refers to the variety and variability of life on Earth, and is represented by the number of different species there are on the planet. Since its introduction, Homo sapiens (the human species) has been killing off entire species either directly (such as through hunting) or indirectly (such as by destroying habitats), causing the extinction of species at an alarming rate. Humans are the cause of the current mass extinction, called the Holocene extinction, driving extinctions to 100 to 1000 times the normal background rate. Though most experts agree that human beings have accelerated the rate of species extinction, some scholars have postulated without humans, the biodiversity of the Earth would grow at an exponential rate rather than decline. The Holocene extinction continues, with meat consumption, overfishing, ocean acidification and the amphibian crisis being a few broader examples of an almost universal, cosmopolitan decline in biodiversity. Human overpopulation (and continued population growth) along with overconsumption, especially by the super-affluent, are considered to be the primary drivers of this rapid decline. The 2017 World Scientists' Warning to Humanity stated that, among other things, this sixth extinction event unleashed by humanity could annihilate many current life forms and consign them to extinction by the end of this century. A 2022 scientific review published in Biological Reviews confirms that a biodiversity loss crisis caused by human activity, which the researchers describe as a sixth mass extinction event, is currently underway.A June 2020 study published in PNAS argues that the contemporary extinction crisis ""may be the most serious environmental threat to the persistence of civilization, because it is irreversible"" and that its acceleration ""is certain because of the still fast growth in human numbers and consumption rates.""


=== Decline in biodiversity ===

Defaunation is the loss of animals from ecological communities.It has been estimated that from 1970 to 2016, 68% of the world's wildlife has been destroyed due to human activity. In South America, there is believed to be a 70 percent loss. A May 2018 study published in PNAS found that 83% of wild mammals, 80% of marine mammals, 50% of plants and 15% of fish have been lost since the dawn of human civilization. Currently, livestock make up 60% of the biomass of all mammals on earth, followed by humans (36%) and wild mammals (4%). According to the 2019 global biodiversity assessment by IPBES, human civilization has pushed one million species of plants and animals to the brink of extinction, with many of these projected to vanish over the next few decades.When plant biodiversity declines, the remaining plants face diminishing productivity. Biodiversity loss threatens ecosystem productivity and services such as food, fresh water, raw materials and medicinal resources.A 2019 report that assessed a total of 28,000 plant species concluded that close to half of them were facing a threat of extinction. The failure of noticing and appreciating plants is regarded as ""plant blindness"", and this is a worrying trend as it puts more plants at the threat of extinction than animals. Our increased farming has come at a higher cost to plant biodiversity as half of the habitable land on Earth is used for agriculture, and this is one of the major reasons behind the plant extinction crisis.


=== Invasive species ===

Invasive species are defined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as non-native to the specific ecosystem, and whose presence is likely to harm the health of humans or the animals in said system.
Introductions of non-native species into new areas have brought about major and permanent changes to the environment over large areas. Examples include the introduction of Caulerpa taxifolia into the Mediterranean, the introduction of oat species into the California grasslands, and the introduction of privet, kudzu, and purple loosestrife to North America. Rats, cats, and goats have radically altered biodiversity in many islands. Additionally, introductions have resulted in genetic changes to native fauna where interbreeding has taken place, as with buffalo with domestic cattle, and wolves with domestic dogs.


=== Human Introduced Invasive Species ===


==== Cats ====
Domestic and feral cats globally are particularly notorious for their destruction of native birds and other animal species. This is especially true for Australia, which attributes over two-thirds of mammal extinction to domestic and feral cats, and over 1.5 billion deaths to native animals each year. Because domesticated outside cats are fed by their owners, they can continue to hunt even when prey populations decline and they would otherwise go elsewhere. This is a major problem for places where there is a highly diverse and dense number of lizards, birds, snakes, and mice populating the area. Roaming outdoor cats can also be attributed to the transmission of harmful diseases like rabies and toxoplasmosis to the native wildlife population.


==== Burmese Python ====
Another example of a destructive introduced invasive species is the Burmese Python. Originating from parts of Southeast Asia, the Burmese Python has made the most notable impact in the Southern Florida Everglades of the United States. After a breeding facility breach in 1992 due to flooding and snake owners releasing unwanted pythons back into the wild, the population of the Burmese Python would boom in the warm climate of Florida in the following years. This impact has been felt most significantly at the southernmost regions of the Everglades. A study in 2012 compared native species population counts in Florida from 1997 and found that raccoon populations declined 99.3%, opossums 98.9%, and rabbit/fox populations effectively disappeared


=== Coral reef decline ===


=== Water pollution ===

Domestic, industrial and agricultural wastewater can be treated in wastewater treatment plants for treatment before being released into aquatic ecosystems. Treated wastewater still contains a range of different chemical and biological contaminants which may influence surrounding ecosystems.


== Impacts on climate ==


=== Climate change ===

Contemporary climate change is the result of increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, which is caused primarily by combustion of fossil fuel (coal, oil, natural gas), and by deforestation, land use changes, and cement production. Such massive alteration of the global carbon cycle has only been possible because of the availability and deployment of advanced technologies, ranging in application from fossil fuel exploration, extraction, distribution, refining, and combustion in power plants and automobile engines and advanced farming practices. Livestock contributes to climate change both through the production of greenhouse gases and through destruction of carbon sinks such as rain-forests. According to the 2006 United Nations/FAO report, 18% of all greenhouse gas emissions found in the atmosphere are due to livestock. The raising of livestock and the land needed to feed them has resulted in the destruction of millions of acres of rainforest and as global demand for meat rises, so too will the demand for land. Ninety-one percent of all rainforest land deforested since 1970 is now used for livestock. Potential negative environmental impacts caused by increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are rising global air temperatures, altered hydrogeological cycles resulting in more frequent and severe droughts, storms, and floods, as well as sea level rise and ecosystem disruption.


=== Acid deposition ===

The fossils that are burned by humans for energy usually come back to them in the form of acid rain. Acid rain is a form of precipitation which has high sulfuric and nitric acids which can occur in the form of a fog or snow. Acid rain has numerous ecological impacts on streams, lakes, wetlands and other aquatic environments. It damages forests, robs the soil of its essential nutrients, releases aluminium to the soil, which makes it very hard for trees to absorb water.Researchers have discovered that kelp, eelgrass and other vegetation can effectively absorb carbon dioxide and hence reducing ocean acidity. Scientists, therefore, say that growing these plants could help in mitigating the damaging effects of acidification on marine life.


=== Ozone depletion ===


=== Disruption of the nitrogen cycle ===

Of particular concern is N2O, which has an average atmospheric lifetime of 114–120 years, and is 300 times more effective than CO2 as a greenhouse gas. NOx produced by industrial processes, automobiles and agricultural fertilization and NH3 emitted from soils (i.e., as an additional byproduct of nitrification) and livestock operations are transported to downwind ecosystems, influencing N cycling and nutrient losses. Six major effects of NOx and NH3 emissions have been identified:
decreased atmospheric visibility due to ammonium aerosols (fine particulate matter [PM])
elevated ozone concentrations
ozone and PM affects human health (e.g. respiratory diseases, cancer)
increases in radiative forcing and global warming
decreased agricultural productivity due to ozone deposition
ecosystem acidification and eutrophication.


== Technology impacts ==

The applications of technology often result in unavoidable and unexpected environmental impacts, which according to the I = PAT equation is measured as resource use or pollution generated per unit GDP. Environmental impacts caused by the application of technology are often perceived as unavoidable for several reasons. First, given that the purpose of many technologies is to exploit, control, or otherwise ""improve"" upon nature for the perceived benefit of humanity while at the same time, the myriad of processes in nature have been optimized and are continually adjusted by evolution, any disturbance of these natural processes by technology is likely to result in negative environmental consequences. Second, the conservation of mass principle and the first law of thermodynamics (i.e., conservation of energy) dictate that whenever material resources or energy are moved around or manipulated by technology, environmental consequences are inescapable. Third, according to the second law of thermodynamics, order can be increased within a system (such as the human economy) only by increasing disorder or entropy outside the system (i.e., the environment). Thus, technologies can create ""order"" in the human economy (i.e., order as manifested in buildings, factories, transportation networks, communication systems, etc.) only at the expense of increasing ""disorder"" in the environment. According to several studies, increased entropy is likely to correlate to negative environmental impacts.


== Mining industry ==

The environmental impact of mining includes erosion, formation of sinkholes, loss of biodiversity, and contamination of soil, groundwater and surface water by chemicals from mining processes. In some cases, additional forest logging is done in the vicinity of mines to increase the available room for the storage of the created debris and soil.Even though plants need some heavy metals for their growth, excess of these metals is usually toxic to them. Plants that are polluted with heavy metals usually depict reduced growth, yield and performance. Pollution by heavy metals decreases the soil organic matter composition resulting in a decline in soil nutrients which then leads to a decline in the growth of plants or even death.Besides creating environmental damage, the contamination resulting from leakage of chemicals also affect the health of the local population. Mining companies in some countries are required to follow environmental and rehabilitation codes, ensuring the area mined is returned to close to its original state. Some mining methods may have significant environmental and public health effects. Heavy metals usually exhibit toxic effects towards the soil biota, and this is through the affection of the microbial processes and decreases the number as well as activity of soil microorganisms. Low concentration of heavy metals also has high chances of inhibiting the plant's physiological metabolism.


== Energy industry ==

The environmental impact of energy harvesting and consumption is diverse. In recent years there has been a trend towards the increased commercialization of various renewable energy sources.
In the real world, consumption of fossil fuel resources leads to global warming and climate change. However, little change is being made in many parts of the world. If the peak oil theory proves true, more explorations of viable alternative energy sources, could be more friendly to the environment.
Rapidly advancing technologies can achieve a transition of energy generation, water and waste management, and food production towards better environmental and energy usage practices using methods of systems ecology and industrial ecology.


=== Biodiesel ===

The environmental impact of biodiesel includes energy use, greenhouse gas emissions and some other kinds of pollution. A joint life cycle analysis by the US Department of Agriculture and the US Department of Energy found that substituting 100% biodiesel for petroleum diesel in buses reduced life cycle consumption of petroleum by 95%. Biodiesel reduced net emissions of carbon dioxide by 78.45%, compared with petroleum diesel. In urban buses, biodiesel reduced particulate emissions 32 percent, carbon monoxide emissions 35 percent, and emissions of sulfur oxides 8%, relative to life cycle emissions associated with use of petroleum diesel. Life cycle emissions of hydrocarbons were 35% higher and emission of various nitrogen oxides (NOx) were 13.5% higher with biodiesel. Life cycle analyses by the Argonne National Laboratory have indicated reduced fossil energy use and reduced greenhouse gas emissions with biodiesel, compared with petroleum diesel use. Biodiesel derived from various vegetable oils (e.g. canola or soybean oil), is readily biodegradable in the environment compared with petroleum diesel.


=== Coal mining and burning ===

The environmental impact of coal mining and -burning is diverse. Legislation passed by the US Congress in 1990 required the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue a plan to alleviate toxic air pollution from coal-fired power plants. After delay and litigation, the EPA now has a court-imposed deadline of 16 March 2011, to issue its report. Surface coal mining has the greatest impact on the environment due to its unique extraction process requiring drilling and blasting, which releases macro amounts of airborne particles into the air. This airborne particulate matter releases harmful toxins into the atmosphere such as ammonia, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides. These toxins then lead to many detrimental health effects such as respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular disease. Although coal is the most widely utilized source of energy around the world, the burning of coal emits poisonous toxins into the air, leading to various health ailments of the skin, blood and lung diseases, and various forms of cancer, while also contributing to global warming by the emission of these toxins into the environment.  The technology for mining activity has advanced over the years, leading to an increase in mine waste leading to more pollution problems, according to the Safe Drinking Water Foundation Studies that have been conducted in various countries like India, have proven that coal mining has a detrimental effect on other biotic and abiotic factors including vegetation and soil, leading to a decrease in plant populations in mining sites 


=== Electricity generation ===


=== Nuclear power ===

The environmental impact of nuclear power results from the nuclear fuel cycle processes including mining, processing, transporting and storing fuel and radioactive fuel waste. Released radioisotopes pose a health danger to human populations, animals and plants as radioactive particles enter organisms through various transmission routes.
Radiation is a carcinogen and causes numerous effects on living organisms and systems. The environmental impacts of nuclear power plant disasters such as the Chernobyl disaster, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster and the Three Mile Island accident, among others, persist indefinitely, though several other factors contributed to these events including improper management of fail safe systems and natural disasters putting uncommon stress on the generators. The radioactive decay rate of particles varies greatly, dependent upon the nuclear properties of a particular isotope. Radioactive Plutonium-244 has a half-life of 80.8 million years, which indicates the time duration required for half of a given sample to decay, though very little plutonium-244 is produced in the nuclear fuel cycle and lower half-life materials have lower activity thus giving off less dangerous radiation.


=== Oil shale industry ===

The environmental impact of the oil shale industry includes the consideration of issues such as land use, waste management, water and air pollution caused by the extraction and processing of oil shale. Surface mining of oil shale deposits causes the usual environmental impacts of open-pit mining. In addition, the combustion and thermal processing generate waste material, which must be disposed of, and harmful atmospheric emissions, including carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas. Experimental in-situ conversion processes and carbon capture and storage technologies may reduce some of these concerns in future, but may raise others, such as the pollution of groundwater.


=== Petroleum ===

The environmental impact of petroleum is often negative because it is toxic to almost all forms of life. Petroleum, a common word for oil or natural gas, is closely linked to virtually all aspects of present society, especially for transportation and heating for both homes and for commercial activities.


=== Reservoirs ===

The environmental impact of reservoirs is coming under ever increasing scrutiny as the world demand for water and energy increases and the number and size of reservoirs increases.
Dams and the reservoirs can be used to supply drinking water, generate hydroelectric power, increasing the water supply for irrigation, provide recreational opportunities and flood control. However, adverse environmental and sociological impacts have also been identified during and after many reservoir constructions. Although the impact varies greatly between different dams and reservoirs, common criticisms include preventing sea-run fish from reaching their historical mating grounds, less access to water downstream, and a smaller catch for fishing communities in the area. Advances in technology have provided solutions to many negative impacts of dams but these advances are often not viewed as worth investing in if not required by law or under the threat of fines. Whether reservoir projects are ultimately beneficial or detrimental—to both the environment and surrounding human populations— has been debated since the 1960s and probably long before that. In 1960 the construction of Llyn Celyn and the flooding of Capel Celyn provoked political uproar which continues to this day. More recently, the construction of Three Gorges Dam and other similar projects throughout Asia, Africa and Latin America have generated considerable environmental and political debate.


=== Wind power ===


== Manufacturing ==


=== Cleaning agents ===

The environmental impact of cleaning agents is diverse. In recent years, measures have been taken to reduce these effects.


=== Nanotechnology ===

Nanotechnology's environmental impact can be split into two aspects: the potential for nanotechnological innovations to help improve the environment, and the possibly novel type of pollution that nanotechnological materials might cause if released into the environment. As nanotechnology is an emerging field, there is great debate regarding to what extent industrial and commercial use of nanomaterials will affect organisms and ecosystems.


=== Paint ===

The environmental impact of paint is diverse. Traditional painting materials and processes can have harmful effects on the environment, including those from the use of lead and other additives. Measures can be taken to reduce environmental impact, including accurately estimating paint quantities so that wastage is minimized, use of paints, coatings, painting accessories and techniques that are environmentally preferred. The United States Environmental Protection Agency guidelines and Green Star ratings are some of the standards that can be applied.


=== Paper ===


=== Plastics ===

Some scientists suggest that by 2050 there could be more plastic than fish in the oceans. A December 2020 study published in Nature found that human-made materials, or anthropogenic mass, exceeds all living biomass on earth, with plastic alone outweighing the mass of all terrestrial and marine animals combined.


=== Pesticides ===

The environmental impact of pesticides is often greater than what is intended by those who use them. Over 98% of sprayed insecticides and 95% of herbicides reach a destination other than their target species, including nontarget species, air, water, bottom sediments, and food. Pesticide contaminates land and water when it escapes from production sites and storage tanks, when it runs off from fields, when it is discarded, when it is sprayed aerially, and when it is sprayed into water to kill algae.The amount of pesticide that migrates from the intended application area is influenced by the particular chemical's properties: its propensity for binding to soil, its vapor pressure, its water solubility, and its resistance to being broken down over time. Factors in the soil, such as its texture, its ability to retain water, and the amount of organic matter contained in it, also affect the amount of pesticide that will leave the area. Some pesticides contribute to global warming and the depletion of the ozone layer.


=== Pharmaceuticals and personal care ===


== Transport ==

The environmental impact of transport is significant because it is a major user of energy, and burns most of the world's petroleum. This creates air pollution, including nitrous oxides and particulates, and is a significant contributor to global warming through emission of carbon dioxide, for which transport is the fastest-growing emission sector. By subsector, road transport is the largest contributor to global warming.Environmental regulations in developed countries have reduced the individual vehicles emission; however, this has been offset by an increase in the number of vehicles, and more use of each vehicle. Some pathways to reduce the carbon emissions of road vehicles considerably have been studied. Energy use and emissions vary largely between modes, causing environmentalists to call for a transition from air and road to rail and human-powered transport, and increase transport electrification and energy efficiency.
Other environmental impacts of transport systems include traffic congestion and automobile-oriented urban sprawl, which can consume natural habitat and agricultural lands. By reducing transportation emissions globally, it is predicted that there will be significant positive effects on Earth's air quality, acid rain, smog and climate change.The health impact of transport emissions is also of concern. A recent survey of the studies on the effect of traffic emissions on pregnancy outcomes has linked exposure to emissions to adverse effects on gestational duration and possibly also intrauterine growth.


=== Aviation ===

The environmental impact of aviation occurs because aircraft engines emit noise, particulates, and gases which contribute to climate change and global dimming. Despite emission reductions from aircraft engines and more fuel-efficient and less polluting turbofan and turboprop engines, the rapid growth of air travel in recent years contributes to an increase in total pollution attributable to aviation. In the EU, greenhouse gas emissions from aviation increased by 87% between 1990 and 2006. Among other factors leading to this phenomenon are the increasing number of hypermobile travellers and social factors that are making air travel commonplace, such as frequent flyer programs.There is an ongoing debate about possible taxation of air travel and the inclusion of aviation in an emissions trading scheme, with a view to ensuring that the total external costs of aviation are taken into account.


=== Roads ===

The environmental impact of roads includes the local effects of highways (public roads) such as on noise pollution, light pollution, water pollution, habitat destruction/disturbance and local air quality; and the wider effects including climate change from vehicle emissions. The design, construction and management of roads, parking and other related facilities as well as the design and regulation of vehicles can change the impacts to varying degrees.


=== Shipping ===

The environmental impact of shipping includes greenhouse gas emissions and oil pollution. In 2007, carbon dioxide emissions from shipping were estimated at 4 to 5% of the global total, and estimated by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to rise by up to 72% by 2020 if no action is taken. There is also a potential for introducing invasive species into new areas through shipping, usually by attaching themselves to the ship's hull.
The First Intersessional Meeting of the IMO Working Group on Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships took place in Oslo, Norway on 23–27 June 2008. It was tasked with developing the technical basis for the reduction mechanisms that may form part of a future IMO regime to control greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping, and a draft of the actual reduction mechanisms themselves, for further consideration by IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC).


== Military ==

General military spending and military activities have marked environmental effects. The United States military is considered one of the worst polluters in the world, responsible for over 39,000 sites contaminated with hazardous materials. Several studies have also found a strong positive correlation between higher military spending and higher carbon emissions where increased military spending has a larger effect on increasing carbon emissions in the Global North than in the Global South. Military activities also affect land use and are extremely resource-intensive.The military does not solely have negative effects on the environment. There are several examples of militaries aiding in land management, conservation, and greening of an area. Additionally, certain military technologies have proven extremely helpful for conservationists and environmental scientists.As well as the cost to human life and society, there is a significant environmental impact of war. Scorched earth methods during, or after war have been in use for much of recorded history but with modern technology war can cause a far greater devastation on the environment. Unexploded ordnance can render land unusable for further use or make access across it dangerous or fatal.


== Light pollution ==

Artificial light at night is one of the most obvious physical changes that humans have made to the biosphere, and is the easiest form of pollution to observe from space. The main environmental impacts of artificial light are due to light's use as an information source (rather than an energy source). The hunting efficiency of visual predators generally increases under artificial light, changing predator prey interactions. Artificial light also affects dispersal, orientation, migration, and hormone levels, resulting in disrupted circadian rhythms.


== Fast fashion ==

Fast fashion has become one of the most successful industries in many capitalist societies with the increase in globalisation. Fast fashion is the cheap mass production of clothing, which is then sold on at very low prices to consumers. Today, the industry is worth £2 trillion.


=== Environmental impacts ===
In terms of carbon dioxide emissions, the fast fashion industry contributes between 4–5 billion tonnes per year, equating to 8–10% of total global emissions. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, meaning it causes heat to get trapped in the atmosphere, rather than being released into space, raising the Earth's temperature – known as global warming.Alongside greenhouse gas emissions the industry is also responsible for almost 35% of microplastic pollution in the oceans. Scientists have estimated that there are approximately 12–125 trillion tonnes of microplastic particles in the Earth's oceans. These particles are ingested by marine organisms, including fish later eaten by humans. The study states that many of the fibres found are likely to have come from clothing and other textiles, either from washing, or degradation.Textile waste is a huge issue for the environment, with around 2.1 billion tonnes of unsold or faulty clothing being disposed per year. Much of this is taken to landfill, but the majority of materials used to make clothes are not biodegradable, resulting in them breaking down and contaminating soil and water.Fashion, much like most other industries such as agriculture, requires a large volume of water for production. The rate and quantity at which clothing is produced in fast fashion means the industry uses 79 trillion litres of water every year. Water consumption has proven to be very detrimental to the environment and its ecosystems, leading to water depletion and water scarcity. Not only do these affect marine organisms, but also human's food sources, such as crops. The industry is culpable for roughly one-fifth of all industrial water pollution.

=== Warnings by the scientific community ===
There are many publications from the scientific community to warn everyone about growing threats to sustainability, in particular threats to ""environmental sustainability"". The World Scientists' Warning to Humanity in 1992 begins with: ""Human beings and the natural world are on a collision course"". About 1,700 of the world's leading scientists, including most Nobel Prize laureates in the sciences, signed this warning letter. The letter mentions severe damage to the atmosphere, oceans, ecosystems, soil productivity, and more. It said that if humanity wants to prevent the damage, steps need to be taken: better use of resources, abandonment of fossil fuels, stabilization of human population, elimination of poverty and more. More warning letters were signed in 2017 and 2019 by thousands of scientists from over 150 countries which called again to reduce overconsumption (including eating less meat), reducing fossil fuels use and other resources and so forth.

Thunderhawk (Dorney Park),"Thunderhawk is a wooden roller coaster with an out-and-back layout located at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Originally opening as The Coaster in 1924, Thunderhawk is the oldest operating roller coaster in the Cedar Fair chain and one of the oldest in the world still in operation. It was manufactured by Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters and designed by Herbert Paul Schmeck, who studied under the legendary John A. Miller and went on to mentor another renowned designer, John C. Allen.


== History ==
Thunderhawk was designed by Herbert Paul Schmeck and built by the Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters. When Thunderhawk opened on March 30,1924 and for many years after the ride was known simply as the Coaster. The Coaster was renamed Thunderhawk with the addition of the Hercules roller coaster to the park in 1989.
Originally, the Coaster was built as an out-and-back coaster, meaning it went straight out from the first drop, turned around and came straight back. The ride was reconfigured in 1930 to its present design with a figure-eight twister section in the middle of the ride. Over the years, the ride has seen many cosmetic changes. At one point the ride featured a bright yellow paint job, which has since been painted over with an off-white color.
The original station pavilion featured a separate bumper car ride, around which wrapped the line for the Coaster, providing some entertainment to those waiting in line. Originally, the ride began with a tunneled section and ended with another tunneled section, as the train went under the portion of the pavilion devoted to the bumper cars. However, the bumper cars were removed following Cedar Fair's purchase of the park in 1993, leaving the tunnel that began the ride as an open concrete trench. In addition, a set of brakes was placed in the middle of the return bunny hills causing the train to slow down and lose much of its trademark airtime.
The Thunderhawk structure was maintained by carpenter Paul Hottenstein, nicknamed ""Shorty,"" from 1961 until his sudden death in the winter of 2001. A plaque in the ride's station honors him and his work on the ride.
Thunderhawk continues to be one of the park's most popular and beloved rides. To this day, it remains a classic example of an early American wooden roller coaster.
For the 2016 season, Dorney Park announced major renovations to Thunderhawk. Among the changes were new trains designed by Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters, featuring an open-air design, with individual ratcheting lap bars (as opposed to the previous ""buzz bars""). The ride also received a new coat of white paint, reminiscent of the coaster's original color, and a new white lighting package to outline the entire ride.In 2021, the American Coaster Enthusiasts gave Thunderhawk an ACE Coaster Landmark plaque.


== Incidents ==

On July 21, 1990, two trains on Thunderhawk collided at the bottom of the lift hill. 17 people were taken to local hospitals to receive treatment for minor injuries. It is unknown what caused the accident, as certified ride operators tested the ride after the accident and found nothing mechanically or physically wrong with it; however, it is said that operator error may have caused the accident. The ride was closed immediately after the accident happened and re-opened the next day.

Badrinath Temple,"Badarinath or Badarinarayana Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Vishnu. It is situated in the town of Badrinath in Uttarakhand, India. The temple is also one of the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to Vishnu—holy shrines for Vaishnavas—who is worshipped as Badrinath. It is open for six months every year (between the end of April and the beginning of November), because of extreme weather conditions in the Himalayan region. The temple is located in Garhwal hill tracks in Chamoli district along the banks of Alaknanda River. It is one of the most visited pilgrimage centers of India, having recorded 2.8 million (28 lakh) visits in just 2 months in 2022. It is one of the Char Dham pilgrimage sites.
The image of the presiding deity worshipped in the temple is a 1 ft (0.30 m), the black granite deity of Vishnu in the form of Badrinarayan. The deity is considered by many Hindus to be one of eight svayam vyakta kshetras, or self-manifested deities of Vishnu.Mata Murti Ka Mela, which commemorates the descent of river Ganges on mother earth, is the most prominent festival celebrated in the Badrinath Temple. Although Badrinath is located in North India, the head priest, or Rawal, is traditionally a Nambudiri chosen from the South Indian state of Kerala. The temple was included in the Uttar Pradesh state government Act No. 30/1948 as Act no. 16,1939, which later came to be known as ""Shri Badarinath and Shri Kedarnath Mandir Act"". The committee nominated by the state government administers both the temples and has seventeen members on its board.

The temple is mentioned in ancient religious texts like Vishnu Purana and Skanda Purana. It is glorified in the Naalayira Divya Prabandham, an early medieval Tamil canon of the Alvar saints from the 6th–9th centuries CE.


== Location, architecture, and shrines ==
The temple is located in Garhwal hill tracts along the banks of the Alaknanda River in Chamoli district in Uttarakhand. The hill tracts are located 3,133 m (10,279 ft) above the mean sea level. The Nar Parbat mountain is located opposite to the temple, while the Narayana Parbat is located behind the Neelkanth peak.Adi Shankara established Badrinath as a pilgrimage site in the ninth century. The temple has three structures: the Garbhagriha (sanctum), the Darshan Mandapa (worship hall), and Sabha Mandapa (convention hall). The conical-shaped roof of the sanctum, the garbhagriha, is approximately 15 m (49 ft) tall with a small cupola on top, covered with a gold gilt roof. The facade is built of stone and has arched windows. A broad stairway leads up to the main entrance, a tall, arched gateway. Just inside is a mandap, a large, pillared hall that leads to the sanctum, or main shrine area. The walls and pillars of the hall are covered with intricate carvings.The main shrine houses the 1 ft (0.30 m) Shaligram (black stone) deity of Badrinarayana, which is housed in a gold canopy under a Badri Tree. The deity of Badrinarayana shows him holding a Shankha (conch) and a Chakra (wheel) in two of his arms in a lifted posture and the other two arms resting on his lap in a Yogamudra (Padmasana) posture. The sanctum also houses images of the god of wealth—Kubera, sage Narada, Uddhava, Nara and Narayana. There are fifteen more images that are also worshipped around the temple. These include that of Lakshmi (the consort of Vishnu), Garuda (the vahana of Narayan), and Navadurga, the manifestation of Durga in nine different forms. The temple also has shrines of Lakshmi Narasimhar and for saints Adi Shankara (788-820 CE), Nar and Narayan, Ghantakarna, Vedanta Desika  and Ramanujacharya. All the deities of the temple are made of black stone.The Tapt Kund, a group of hot sulphur springs just below the temple, are considered to be medicinal; many pilgrims consider it a requirement to bathe in the springs before visiting the temple. The springs have a year-round temperature of 55 °C (131 °F), while outside temperature is typically below 17 °C (63 °F) all year round. The two water ponds in the temple are called Narad Kund and Surya Kund.


== History ==

There is no historical record about the temple, but there is a mention of the presiding deity Badrinath in Vedic scriptures (c. 1750–500 BCE).  According to some accounts, the shrine was worshipped in some form in the Vedic period. Later, during Ashoka's reign, because of the spread of Buddhism, this shrine might have been converted into a Buddhist shrine. The temple was a Buddhist shrine till the 8th century and Adi Shankara revived the shrine and converted it to a Hindu temple. The architecture of the temple resembling that of a Buddhist vihara (temple) and the brightly painted facade which is atypical of Buddhist temples leads to the argument. Other accounts relate that it was originally established as a pilgrimage site by Adi Shankara in the ninth century. It is believed that Shankara resided in the place for six years from 814 to 820 CE. He resided six months in Badrinath and the rest of the year in Kedarnath. Hindu followers assert that he discovered the deity of Badrinath in the Alaknanda River and enshrined it in a cave near the Tapt Kund hot springs. A traditional story asserts that Shankara expelled all the Buddhists in the region with the help of the Parmar ruler king Kanak Pal. The hereditary successors of the king governed the temple and endowed villages to meet its expenses. The income from a set of villages on the route to the temple was used to feed and accommodate pilgrims. The Parmar rulers held the title ""Bolanda Badrinath"", meaning speaking Badrinath. They had other titles, including Shri 108 Basdrishcharyaparayan Garharaj Mahimahendra, Dharmabibhab, and Dharamarakshak Sigamani.The throne of Badrinath was named after the presiding deity; the king enjoyed ritual obeisance by the devotees before proceeding to the shrine. The practice was continued until the late 19th century. During the 16th century, the King of Garhwal moved the murti to the present temple. When the state of Garhwal was divided, the Badrinath temple came under British rule but the king of Garhwal continued as the chairman of the management committee. The selection of priest is done after consultation between Garhwal and Travancore royal families.The temple has undergone several major renovations due to its age and damage by an avalanche. In the 17th century, the temple was expanded by the Kings of Garhwal. After significant damage during the great 1803 Garhwal earthquake, it was largely rebuilt by the King of Jaipur. It was still under renovation as late as the 1870s but these were completed by the time of the First World War. At that time, the town was still small, consisting of only the 20-odd huts housing the temple's staff, but the number of pilgrims was usually between seven and ten thousand. The Kumbh Mela festival held every twelve years raised the number of visitors to 50,000. The temple also enjoyed revenue from the rents owed to it by various villages bequeathed by various rajas.During 2006, the state government announced the area around Badrinath as a no construction zone to curb illegal encroachment.


== Legend ==
According to Hindu legend, the god Vishnu sat in meditation at this place. During his meditation, Vishnu was unaware of cold weather. Lakshmi, his consort, protected him in the form of the Badri tree (jujube or Indian date, called 'ber' in Hindi). Pleased by the devotion of Lakshmi, Vishnu named the place Badrika Ashrama. According to Atkinson (1979), the place used to be a jujube forest, which is not found there today. Vishnu in the form of Badrinath is depicted in the temple sitting in the padmasana posture. According to the legend, Vishnu was chastised by sage Narada, who saw Vishnu's consort, Lakshmi, massaging his feet. Vishnu went to Badrinath to perform austerity, meditating for a long time in padmasana.The Vishnu Purana narrates another version of the origins of Badrinath. According to the tradition, Yama had two sons, Nara, and Narayana—both of which are modern names of Himalayan mountains. They chose the place to spread their religion and each of them wed the spacious valleys in the Himalayas. Searching for an ideal place to set up a hermitage, they came across the other four Badris of the Pancha Badri, namely Bridha Badri, Yoga Badri, Dhyana Badri and Bhavisha Badri. They finally found the hot and cold spring behind the Alaknanda River and named it  ""Badri Vishala.""


== Literature ==
The temple finds mention in several ancient books like Bhagavata Purana, Skanda Purana and Mahabharata. According to the Bhagavata Purana, ""[t]here in Badrikashram the Personality of Godhead (Vishnu), in his incarnation as the sages Nar and Narayana, had been undergoing great penance since time immemorial for the welfare of all living entities"". The Skanda Purana states that ""[t]here are several sacred shrines in heaven, on earth, and in hell; but there is no shrine like Badrinath"". The area around Badrinath is also celebrated in Padma Purana as abounding in spiritual treasures. The Mahabharata revered the holy place as the one which can give salvation to devotees arriving close to if, while in other holy places they must perform religious ceremonies. The temple is revered in Nalayira Divya Prabandham, in 11 hymns in the 7th–9th century Vaishnava canon by Perialvar and in 13 hymns by Thirumangai Alvar. It is one of the 108 Divya Desam dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Badrinath. The temple is referred as Tiruvatariyaacciraamam in Tamil literature.


== Pilgrimage ==
Devotees of all faiths and all schools of thought of Hinduism visit the Badrinath Temple. All the major monastic institutions like Kashi Math, Jeeyar Mutt (Andhra mutt), Udupi Pejavar and Manthralayam Sri Raghavendra Swamy Mutts have their branches and guest houses there.
The Badrinath temple is one of five related shrines called Panch Badri, which are dedicated to the worship of Vishnu. The five temples are Vishal Badri - Badrinath Temple in Badrinath, Yogadhyan Badri located at Pandukeshwar, Bhavishya Badri located 17 km (10.6 mi) from Jyotirmath at Subain, Vridh Badri located 7 km (4.3 mi) from Jyotirmath in Animath and Adi Badri located 17 km (10.6 mi) from Karnaprayag. The temple is considered one of the holiest Hindu Char Dham (four divine) sites, comprising Rameswaram, Badrinath, Puri and Dwarka. Although the temple's origins are not clearly known, the Advaita school of Hinduism established by Adi Shankara attributes the origin of Char Dham to the seer. The four monasteries are located across the four corners of India and their attendant temples are Badrinath Temple at Badrinath in the North, Jagannath Temple at Puri in the East, Dwarakadheesh Temple at Dwarka in the West and Rameshwaram at Rameshwaram, Tamil Nadu in the South.Though ideologically the temples are divided between the sects of Hinduism, namely Saivism and Vaishnavism, the Char Dham pilgrimage is an all-Hindu affair. There are four abodes in the Himalayas called Chota Char Dham (Chota meaning small): Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri—all of which lie in the foothills of the Himalayas. The name Chota was added during the mid of 20th century to differentiate the original Char Dhams. As the number of pilgrims to these places has increased in modern times, it is called Himalayan Char Dham.The journey across the four cardinal points in India is considered sacred by Hindus, who aspire to visit these temples once in their lifetimes. Traditionally, the pilgrimage starts at the eastern end from Puri, proceeding clockwise in a manner typically followed for circumambulation in Hindu temples.


== Festivals and religious practices ==
The most prominent festival held at Badrinath Temple is Mata Murti Ka Mela, which commemorates the descent of the river Ganges on mother earth. The mother of Badrinath, who is believed to have divided the river into twelve channels for the welfare of earthly beings, is worshiped during the festival. The place where the river flowed became the holy land of Badrinath.The Badri Kedar festival is celebrated during the month of June in both the temple and the Kedarnath temple. The festival lasts for eight days; artists from all over the country perform during the function.The major religious activities (or pujas) performed every morning are mahabhishek (ablution), abhishek, gitapath and bhagavat puja, while in the evening the pujas include geet govinda and aarti. Recital in vedic scripts like Ashtotram and Sahasranama is practised during all the rituals. After aarti, the decorations are removed from the image of Badrinath and sandalwood paste is applied to it. The paste from the image is given to the devotees the next day as prasad during the nirmalaya darshan. All the rituals are performed in front of the devotees, unlike those in some Hindu temples, where some practices are hidden from them. Sugar balls and dry leaves are the common prasad provided to the devotees. From May 2006, the practise of offering Panchamrit Prasad, prepared locally and packed in local bamboo baskets, was started.The temple is closed for winter on the auspicious day of bhatridwityia or later during October–November. On the day of closure, Akhanda Jyothi, a lamp is lit filled with ghee to last for six months. Special pujas are performed on the day by the chief priest in the presence of pilgrims and officials of the temple. The image of Badrinath is notionally transferred during the period to the Narasimha temple at Jyotirmath, located 40 mi (64 km) away from the temple. The temple is reopened around April–May on Akshaya tritiya, another auspicious day on the Hindu calendar. Pilgrims gather on the first day of opening of the temple after the winter to witness the Akhanda Jyothi.The temple is one of the holy places where the Hindus offer oblations to ancestors with the help of the priests. Devotees visit the temple to worship in front of the image of Badrinath in the sanctum and have a holy dip in Alaknanda River. The general belief is that a dip in the tank purifies the soul.


== Administration and visit ==
The Badrinath Temple was included in the Uttar Pradesh State Government Act No. 30/1948 as Act no. 16,1939, which was later known as Shri Badarinath and Shri Kedarnath Mandir Act. A committee nominated by the State Government of Uttarakhand administers both the temples. The act was modified in 2002 to appoint additional committee members, including government officials and a Vice-Chairman. There are seventeen members in the board; three selected by the Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly, one member each selected by the District Councils of Chamoli Pauri Garhwal, Tehri Garhwal and Uttarkashi districts, and ten members nominated by the Government of Uttarakhand.As indicated in the temple records, the priests of the temple were Shiva ascetics called Dandi Sanyasis, who belonged to Nambudiri community, a religious group common in modern Kerala. When the last of the ascetics died without an heir in 1776 CE, the King of Garhwal invited non-ascetic Nambudiris from Kerala for the priesthood, a practice that continues in modern times. Till 1939, all the offerings made by the devotees to the temple went to the Rawal (Chief Priest), but after 1939, his jurisdiction was restricted to religious affairs. The administrative structure of the temple consists of a chief executive officer who executes the orders from the state government, a deputy chief executive officer, two OSDs, an executive officer, an account officer, a temple officer, and a public officer to assist the chief executive officer.
Although Badrinath is located in North India, the head priest, or Rawal, is traditionally a Nambudiri Brahmin chosen from the South Indian state of Kerala. This tradition is believed to have been initiated by Adi Shankara, who was a South Indian philosopher. The Rawal is requested by the Government of Uttarakhand to the Government of Kerala. The candidate should possess a degree of Acharya (Post Graduate) in Sanskrit, be a bachelor, well-versed in reciting mantras (sacred texts) and be from the Vaishnava sect of Hinduism. The erstwhile ruler of Garhwal, who is the tutelary head of Badrinath, approves the candidate sent by the Government of Kerala. A Tilak Ceremony is held to instate the Rawal and he is deputed from April to November when the temple remains open. The Rawal is accorded his holiness status by the Garhwal Rifles and the state government of Uttarakhand. He is also held in high esteem by the Royals of Nepal. From April to November, he performs his duties as a temple priest. Thereafter, he either stays in Jyotirmath or returns to his native village in Kerala. The duties of the Rawal starts at 4 a.m. every day with the Abhisheka. He should not cross the river until Vamana Dwadashi and must adhere to Brahmacharya. The Rawal is assisted by the Garhwali Dimri Brahmins belonging to the village Dimmar of Chamoli district, Naib Rawal, Dharmadikari, Vedpathi, a group of priests, Pandas Samadhi, Bhandari, Rasoiyas (cook), devotional singer, clerk of devashram, Jal Bhariya (water keeper) and temple guards. Badrinath is one of the few temples in North India that follow the ancient Tantra Vidhi of Shrauta tradition more common in the south.In 2012, the temple administration introduced a token system for visitors to the temple. Tokens indicating the time of visit were provided from three stalls in the taxi stands. Each devotee to visit the presiding deity is allocated 10–20 seconds. Proof of identity is mandatory to enter the temple. The temple is reached from Rishikesh, located 298 km (185 mi) away via Devprayag, Rudraprayag, Karnaprayag, Nandaprayag, Jyotirmath, Vishnuprayag and Devadarshini. From Kedarnath Temple, visitors can follow the 243 km (151 mi)-long Rudraprayag route or the 230 km (140 mi)-long Ukhimath and Gopeshwar route.

Stephen Maren,"Stephen Andrew Maren (born November 7, 1967) is an American behavioral neuroscientist investigating the brain mechanisms of emotional memory, particularly the role context plays in the behavioral expression of fear.  He has discovered brain circuits regulating context-dependent memory, including mapping functional connections between the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala that are involved in the expression and extinction of learned fear responses.
Maren obtained his undergraduate education at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, graduating in psychology (BS) in 1989. His undergraduate research resulted in an honors thesis that described, for the first time, the activity of basolateral amygdala neurons during this form of learning. He obtained his PhD in Biological Sciences (Neurobiology) in 1993 at the University of Southern California. Maren explored the role for glutamate receptors in hippocampal long-term potentiation and the relationship of long-term potentiation to learning and memory. He was the first to demonstrate that expression of long-term potentiation is associated with an increase in postsynaptic glutamate receptors.Maren received his post-doctoral training with Michael S. Fanselow at the University of California, Los Angeles from 1993 to 1996. He established a role for amygdaloid long-term potentiaion in Pavlovian fear conditioning, as well as defining the role for the hippocampus in contextual learning and memory.Maren joined the faculty of University of Michigan in 1996 as an assistant professor in the Biopsychology Area in the Department of Psychology. He moved to Texas A&M University in 2012, where he is the Charles H. Gregory Chair of Liberal Arts and Professor of Psychological and Brain Sciences and a Presidential Impact Fellow at Texas A&M University. He was named University Distinguished Professor in 2018.Maren has received the Distinguished Scientific Award for an Early Career Contribution to Psychology (Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience) in 2001 and the D. O. Hebb Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award in 2017, both from the American Psychological Association. He was awarded the W. Horsley Gantt Medal by the Pavlovian Society in 2019.  He is a fellow of both the American Psychological Association and the Association for Psychological Science. His research is widely cited and he is among the top 1% of cited neuroscientists in the world.  Maren's research has been continuously funded by the National Institutes of Health since 1995 and he has received s Memory and Cognitive Disorders award from the McKnight Endowment for Neuroscience and a NARSAD Distinguished Investigator Grant from the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation.

T-theory,"T-theory is a branch of discrete mathematics dealing with analysis of trees and discrete metric spaces.


== General history ==
T-theory originated from a question raised by Manfred Eigen in the late 1970s. He was trying to fit twenty distinct t-RNA molecules of the Escherichia coli bacterium into a tree.
An important concept of T-theory is the tight span of a metric space. If X is a metric space, the tight span T(X) of X is, up to isomorphism, the unique minimal injective metric space that contains X. John Isbell was the first to discover the tight span in 1964, which he called the injective envelope. Andreas Dress independently constructed the same construct, which he called the tight span.

John Finnemore's Souvenir Programme,"John Finnemore's Souvenir Programme is a sketch comedy series broadcast on BBC Radio 4. John Finnemore is the sole writer and performs with Margaret Cabourn-Smith, Simon Kane, Lawry Lewin and Carrie Quinlan. The first series was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2011, and further series have followed annually. A special edition recorded at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe was broadcast in 2012.  A 45-minute special containing new material was broadcast on 27th May 2023, the end credits hinting at a possible new series to follow.
All nine series have been released on CD.
The series contains sketches and character monologues, with only one major recurring character, a storyteller (a fictionalised version of John Finnemore) who narrates a tall tale in the last five minutes of most programmes, and who also provides the show's only recurring catchphrase, opening each story with ""Well, since you ask me for..."". This segment occasionally serves as a coda to several connecting sketches within a single episode, such as several small cons made in preparation of a milliner's heist or a time machine's journey into the future. The only other recurring character between episodes is an interviewer played by Carrie Quinlan named Patsy Straightwoman, whose interviewees are often played by Finnemore. The format of the Interview sketches was briefly modified with Straightwoman becoming an investigative journalist for a programme called Behind Closed Doors.
Many episodes include a comic song with words by Finnemore and music by Susannah Pearse. Some of these songs include a cello played by Sally Stares. Stares also appears in the Stoppable sketch as a tram driver and in an Orchestra sketch as a cellist. Many episodes also include a recurring sketch that comes up two to four times in the episode. There are four sketches which parody the BBC Radio 4 series The Archers, portraying the show as it supposedly sounds to people who do not regularly listen to it. Starting in the fifth series the performers often break character, usually to complain to John about the sketches or to provide 'footnotes' highlighting factual errors. Another series of sketches involves a man (Finnemore) and the 'voice in his head' (played by Simon Kane) which appears only to give bad advice or to be otherwise unhelpful, often resulting in public awkwardness or humiliation, such as encouraging him to retrieve a tip so that a barista can see him tipping or to disrupt him whilst trying to give directions.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the ninth series, broadcast in 2021, was not performed before a live audience or accompanied by live music. The series focused on five generations of a family and their collective lore and traditions (such as the song ""Woof, Woof, Woof Goes the Wolfhound"") whose developments and origins are explored in and connect several scenes across different episodes. The series' main characters were Russ Golding (Lewin), Deborah Golding née Wilkinson (Cabourn-Smith), Jeremy 'Jerry' Wilkinson (Kane), Vanessa Wilkinson née Noone (Quinlan) and Oswald 'Uncle Newt' Nightingale (Finnemore). The sketch format was modified, with the first five episodes focusing on each of the main characters with scenes from their lives being depicted in reverse order, whilst the sixth depicts their shared experiences told in nonlinear order. Homages are made to the original format, namely 'Uncle Newt' who is analogous with Finnemore's storyteller character, having told stories to Russ, Deborah, Jerry and Vanessa as children, starting them with the catchphrase ""Well, since you ask me for..."".
A pilot programme with a different supporting cast, titled John Finnemore, Apparently, was broadcast in 2008, starring Tom Goodman-Hill and Sarah Hadland. Many of the sketches in the pilot were subsequently remade for the series.


== Awards ==
John Finnemore's Souvenir Programme was voted Best British Radio Sketch Show in the British Comedy Guide Awards 2011. In 2014, it was awarded Silver for Best Comedy at the Radio Academy Awards. It was also shortlisted for Best Radio Comedy in the 2014 Writers' Guild of Great Britain Awards.

== Production ==
On December 20, 2019, Frontline announced that it will release the two-part television documentary titled America's Great Divide: From Obama to Trump on January 13 and 14, 2020, which will comprehensively examine ""the growth of a toxic political environment that has paralyzed Washington and dramatically deepened the gulf between Americans"", and provide context for the election year of 2020. Director Michael Kirk intended for the film to highlight the irony in Obama's promise to unify the country, ""that by the end of his presidency -- he freely admitted and everyone else could see -- that the division was even deeper, even broader, that racism was even more rampant."" A preview of the documentary was released on January 6, 2020.

America's Great Divide first aired on PBS in the United States on January 13 and 14, 2020. On the same day of the broadcast of ""Part 2"", both parts of the documentary film were made available by Frontline for streaming on YouTube without charge.


== Critical response ==
Brian Lowery of CNN praised America's Great Divide for ""admirably"" charting in detail the deepening division within the United States through the presidencies of Barack Obama and Donald Trump, stating that ""The sobering takeaway from 'America's Great Divide,' explored at some length in the second half, is whether the nastiness that defines current political discourse is irrevocable. John Doyle of the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail also commended the documentary for its compelling presentation of the ""central threads"" which led to the election of Trump, stating that it is ""sobering, at times unnerving and often startling.""

Optima Lake,"Optima Lake was built to be a reservoir in Texas County, Oklahoma. The site is just north of  Hardesty and east of Guymon in the Oklahoma Panhandle.The earthen Optima Lake Dam (National ID # OK20510) was completed in 1978 (1978) by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, with a height of 120 feet (37 m), and a length at its crest of 16,875 feet (5,144 m). Although designed to contain a maximum of 618,500 acre-feet (762,900,000 m3) of water, the lake never reached more than five percent of capacity, and remains effectively empty. Rapid declines in streamflow related to large-scale pumping from the high plains aquifer system, also known as the Ogallala Aquifer, coincided with the completion of the dam, to make the reservoir a dramatic example of unanticipated environmental impacts.The Corps' website states in part (emphasis in original):
""All public use areas around the lake are land access points only, and do not offer swimming, boating, fishing or camping opportunities. The water level in the lake has never reached normal pool. Visitors should be aware that the lake's level is very low, and is often times dry.  Visitors wanting to picnic or view wildlife should come for the quiet natural setting -- with or without water in the lake area.""The lake surroundings offer few to no amenities since lake camping facilities and buildings were dismantled for public safety by the Corps in 2010.


== History ==
The project was originally included as part of the Flood Control Act of 1936, as modified by the Flood Control Act of 1950, but planning and political wrangling delayed the start of construction until 1966.  The intent was for the reservoir to fill primarily from the flow of the Beaver River, also known as the North Canadian River.  Normal flow on the Beaver River, from 1937 to 1966, averaged 32.2 cubic feet per second. The river had occasional floods, including an October 1923 flood amounting to 109,000 acre-feet (134,000,000 m3) of water, and a September 1941 flood in which the Beaver's flow increased to 44,200 cubic feet per second (1,250 m3/s).  The river's most recent flow of significance was in October 1965 at 17,800 cubic feet per second (500 m3/s).  In the end the project was authorized for flood control, drinking and irrigation water in the relatively dry Oklahoma panhandle, recreation, and fish and wildlife conservation.The Guymon Chamber of Commerce, which enthusiastically backed the project, published a pamphlet that touted its expected virtues. The brochure forecast that the lake would be 100 feet (30 m) deep, and its arms would flood up to 10 miles (16 km) up Beaver River and 9 miles (14 km) along its tributary, Coldwater Creek.During the 12 years of construction by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the flow of the Beaver dropped. It was later recognized that because the source of the Beaver was the underground Ogallala Aquifer, being the water table underlying far western Oklahoma and parts of seven other Western states, and due to increased takings from the aquifer for irrigation and drinking water, the river's flow was being reduced to a trickle.The $46.1-million project was completed in 1978. The dam was constructed of compacted earth fill embankment with gated outlet works and a 1,500 foot (460 m) long uncontrolled saddle spillway.  The top of the dam is at 2,821.0 feet (859.8 m) of elevation above sea level.  The specifications put the top of the maximum pool at 2,814.2 feet (857.8 m), the top of the flood control pool at 2,779.0 feet (847.0 m), the top of the conservation pool at 2,763.5 feet (842.3 m), and the top of the inactive pool at 2,726.0 feet (830.9 m).  The conservation pool was designed to hold 117,500 acre-feet (144,900,000 m3) of water, with 76,200 acre-feet (94,000,000 m3) designated to be available as a water supply.  The flood pool capacity was designed for 229,500 acre-feet (283,100,000 m3), while absolute maximum capacity of the lake was set at 618,500 acre-feet (762,900,000 m3).  The Corps forecasted in 1979 that, ""The optimum visitation for the project is 600,000 annual visitors and will be reached in 2014.""But water flow in the Beaver, 1977–1987, averaged only 7 cubic feet per second (0.20 m3/s), far less than the 32.2 cubic feet per second (0.91 m3/s) historical average. In the mid-1980s, the Corps recognized that the reduced flow of the Beaver was permanent and that the reservoir was not going to fill: the maximum lake level was achieved May 31, 1980 at an elevation of 2,722.90 feet (829.94 m), whereas the very bottom of the conservation pool was intended to be 2,726.00 feet (830.88 m). Subsequently, the flow in the Beaver dropped even further. In the last five year period (from 1989–1993) that the U.S. Geological Survey could measure its flow near Guymon, the river averaged less than 0.2 cubic feet per second (5.7 L/s).The Corps formally closed the park in 1995, although the site remained open to the public.  With funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, about 161 decaying structures including picnic enclosures, campsites, restrooms, dump stations, and numerous power poles, were demolished by September 2010 for safety reasons.  As of 2014, the project was receiving 2000 to 5000 visitors annually.A spending controversy erupted in 2009, when the Corps wanted to use $1.2 million of economic stimulus money to replace rotting guardrails on each side of the paved road across the top of the Optima Dam used by approximately 15 cars a day.  Public criticism caused the Corps to instead gate and padlock the road at a cost of $1000.  The Corps' September 2010 Section 216 Initial Appraisal Report on Optima Lake indicated the Corps was spending approximately $160,000 per year for annual inspections of dam structures, detailed inspections at five year intervals, and repairs as budgets allowed.  That same report indicated that existing dam structures (gate tower, stilling basin, uncontrolled spillway and outlet works) remained in operational condition.In the 1973 Environmental Impact Statement done by the Corps during the planning process, a ""dry lake"" option for the project was considered which would have provided for no water retention during normal periods, but would have created an area available as a flood containment pool in the event of abnormally large water events in the area. That concept for Optima was rejected in favor of an active water-containment reservoir; however, the project as it currently exists is consistent with the dry lake option.  The Beaver does occasionally still carry off surface flooding after heavy rains, as in April 2016 when the river was flowing near Guymon for the first time in decades following two days of intense rains that caused Texas County to be declared a disaster area.The overall project included the Optima National Wildlife Refuge, run by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, being initially 2,605 acres (1,054 ha) along Coldwater Creek—which has its confluence with the Beaver 0.2 miles (0.32 km) upstream from the dam— and the Optima Wildlife Management Area, public hunting lands managed by the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation, initially 2,141 acres (866 ha) along the Beaver.  However, the decreased size of the lake itself has led to Optima National Wildlife Refuge being increased to 4,334 acres (1,754 ha), and the area managed by Oklahoma, including licensed Corps lands above and below the dam, increasing to 8,062 acres (3,263 ha).


== Disposition ==
Given Optima’s shortcomings, the Corps did an Appraisal Report in 1991 to explore modifying the project, recommending that a reconnaissance level study be conducted to evaluate possible alternatives.  But, funding for the follow-up study was not provided.  An Initial Appraisal Report was done in 2010, also recommending a reconnaissance level study.  Ideas floated in that document included (but were not limited to) piping Guymon sewage plant-treated water to Optima (about 17 miles), transferring lands to other agencies, reselling the lands to the original landowners, or deauthorizing the project and demolishing all structures.  However, it was not until 2021 that funding was provided for a Disposition Study.  As presented at an October 5, 2022 public meeting, the Disposition Study considered multiple alternatives, including (but not limited to):  (a) No Action (the continuation of existing operations), (b) retaining just the dam structure as a dry flood control reservoir, (c) transferring operations to another federal or state agency to maintain a flood control project, or (d) deauthorizing the entire project and disposing of all real property.

2014 Austrian Grand Prix,"The 2014 Austrian Grand Prix (formally the Formula 1 Grosser Preis Von Österreich 2014) was a Formula One motor race held on 22 June 2014 at the Red Bull Ring in Spielberg, Austria. It was the eighth round of the 2014 season and marked the 28th running of the Austrian Grand Prix and the 27th time it had been held as a round of the Formula One World Championship. It was the first Austrian Grand Prix held since 2003. The 71-lap race was won by Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg after starting from third position. His teammate Lewis Hamilton finished second with Valtteri Bottas third for the Williams team.
Felipe Massa started the race from pole position, his first since the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix and the last of his career. Massa had one previous participation in an Austrian Grand Prix, back in 2002, while from the last Austrian Grand Prix to be held before 2014, which was in 2003, only three drivers (Fernando Alonso, Kimi Räikkönen, and Jenson Button) returned to drive in the 2014 Austrian Grand Prix.


== Report ==


=== Background ===
The Grand Prix was contested by eleven teams, each of two drivers. The teams, also known as constructors, were Red Bull Racing, Mercedes, Ferrari, Lotus, McLaren, Force India, Sauber, Toro Rosso, Williams, Marussia and Caterham. Tyre supplier Pirelli brought four different tyre compounds for the race; two dry compounds, the soft ""primes"" and the supersoft ""options"", and two wet-weather compounds, the intermediate and full wet. The drag reduction system (DRS) had two activation zones for the race; one was on the start/finish straight from the final to first corners, and the second on the straight between turns 2 and 3.Going into the race, Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg led the Drivers' Championship with 140 points, ahead of teammate Lewis Hamilton on 118 points and Daniel Ricciardo on 79. Fernando Alonso was fourth on 69 points while Sebastian Vettel was fifth on 60 points. In the Constructors' Championship Mercedes were leading with 258 points and Red Bull were second on 139 points. Ferrari with 87 points and Force India with 77 points contended for third place, with McLaren fifth on 66 points. Mercedes had so far dominated the championship, winning six out of the previous seven races, with Ricciardo winning the Canadian Grand Prix. Championship competitor Kevin Magnussen had gained one second-place finish, while Jenson Button, Vettel (twice), Sergio Pérez and Alonso had achieved third place podium finishes.


=== Practice and qualifying ===
Nico Rosberg was the fastest in the first free practice session with a lap time of 1:11.295. Teammate Lewis Hamilton was the fastest in the second free practice session with a lap time of 1:09.542. Valtteri Bottas was the fastest in the third free practice session with a lap time of 1:09.848.Williams driver Felipe Massa became the first driver other than Hamilton and Rosberg to claim pole position in 2014 with a Q3 lap time of 1:08.759. He was joined on the front row by teammate Valtteri Bottas; it was the team's first front row lockout since Juan Pablo Montoya and Ralf Schumacher did so, at the 2003 German Grand Prix at Hockenheim.
Hamilton failed to post a time in Q3, ending up ninth on the grid after Sergio Pérez's penalty was applied. On his first flying lap in Q3 – having been 0.4 seconds faster than Bottas' provisional pole time of 1:08.846 through the first two sectors – Hamilton ran wide at the final corner and had his lap time deleted for exceeding track limits. On his second and final lap Hamilton locked his rear brakes under braking for turn 2 and spun. Sebastian Vettel failed to reach Q3, although his teammate Daniel Ricciardo did.


=== Race ===
At the start, Massa led the field into the first corner, with Rosberg passing Bottas, but being repassed the following straight. Hamilton gained five places on the first lap, after passing two cars on the run into the first corner and two further cars heading towards turn 2, before taking another spot from Fernando Alonso at turn 7. As a result, he ended the first lap only one position and 0.9 seconds behind his teammate, despite starting ninth. Sebastian Vettel once again suffered from technical problems, losing drive on the first lap and attempting to retire on lap two. However, his car then regained drive and he was able to continue, albeit a lap down. After damaging his front wing halfway through the race, he later retired from Red Bull Racing's home Grand Prix on lap 34.
At the front, the Mercedes cars were able to pass the Williams cars by stopping earlier and undercutting them during the pitstop phases. Rosberg passed both Williams' during the first stops, and Hamilton took second position during the second round, despite suffering two slow pit stops. Sergio Pérez once again drove a good race with a different tyre strategy, only running the super soft compound for the last 16 laps and successfully challenging Kevin Magnussen for sixth place, despite starting sixteenth following a grid penalty.
For much of the race both Mercedes cars had to manage overheating brake issues. On lap 55 Hamilton was held up by backmarkers, losing around a second. During the final laps, Hamilton was slowly gaining on teammate Rosberg, and despite having lost a total of 1.9 seconds to his teammate through slower pit stops he began the final lap 1.1 seconds behind. However, he was not close enough to his teammate to challenge him and backed off at the end of the lap. Rosberg took the chequered flag for his third win of the season.


=== Post-race ===
As a result of the race, Nico Rosberg extended his championship lead to 29 points, the largest it had been all season.
Lewis Hamilton admitted he was frustrated by his slow pit stops, but said that second was still a ""good result"" considering his qualifying position.Fernando Alonso, who managed to finish closely behind Felipe Massa in the Williams and with a smaller gap to Mercedes than usual, later described the race as his best of the season so far.The race was a remarkable one for Mercedes Team Principal Toto Wolff, who in being a shareholder of both Mercedes and his former team Williams effectively held some ownership of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th placed cars in the race. This remarkable achievement was sweetened by it coming at the Austrian's home race.

Emilio López Zamora dam,"The Emilio López Zamora dam, also known as the Ensenada dam, is a dam with a water treatment plant in Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico, on the basin of the Ensenada stream. Its main use is the containment of flash floods, and as a water supply for the city. It was built in 1976 and is administered by Mexico's National Water Commission (CONAGUA).


== Characteristics ==
The dam has a reservoir capacity of about 3.75 million cubic meters. However, the useful capacity is estimated to be about 2.61 million cubic meters, since the bottom has filled with mud and debris. The area of the reservoir is 54 hectares. The dam is a concrete gravity dam with a length of 200 meters and a maximum height of 34 meters. The width of the crest is 8.5 meters. It has a drop spillway with a maximum drain rate of 30 meters cubic per second.Below the dam, there is a water treatment plant with a capacity of 150 liters per second. It takes water from the reservoir and treats it to drinking level to be sent to the distribution network with a pumping system.


=== Operation ===
The Emilio Lopez Zamora dam is operated by Mexico's National Water Commission. In 2018 preventive maintenance was carried out on the dam with an investment of 2 million pesos.


== History ==
Built in 1976, it was named for hydraulic engineer Emilio Lopez Zamora, who was the Director of Agriculture in Baja California. The purpose of the dam was to contain flash floods from the local streams and surface runoff, and to supply water to the city.In 1993 an area of 72 hectares was expropriated from the nearby Adolfo Ruiz Cortines community to be part of the reservoir.


== Problems and risks ==


=== Drought ===
The contribution from the dam to the water supply is sporadic, because of the irregularity of the Ensenada stream. The dam has reached very low levels of accumulated water, due to poor rainfall during long drought periods, as occurred in 2014, with the dam becoming almost empty in 2015.


=== Overflow risk ===
The dam has reached its maximum capacity and activated the spillway on several occasions, most recently in 2019. During the intense rainfall of March 4, 1978, (86 millimetres (3.4 in) in 24 hours), there was an overflow scare and sandbags were placed at the top of the crest.There is uncertainty among the nearby population concerning a potential overflow, with the risks balanced by the fact that the dam did not overflow during the intense rains of 1978, and since then there have not been similar rainfall levels.The real risk of overflowing is increased when the reservoir partially fills with sand and mud due to the lack of dredging.


=== Garbage and pollution ===
The dam has been illegally used for dumping raw sewage. This situation has worsened due to the population increase in the neighboring communities, including irregular settlements, and with a construction company reported for illegal spilling. On the surface and the edges, garbage and litter, such as plastic bags and bottles, is visible.


=== Suicides ===
In previous years, people have committed suicide by jumping from the dam, until fences were installed to prevent access.


== Other community uses ==
The dam also serves as a vehicular and pedestrian bridge.In the 2002 the Ensenada city council declared the reservoir and surrounding area as an ecological reserve, and in 2007 it was determined to be a protected zone. Plans have been introduced to create a park around the dam or a series of parks from the dam to the ocean following the stream.The reservoir has been used as a training site for competitive kayaking and boating.


== Flora and fauna ==


=== Vegetation ===
The vegetation around the dam consists of, in order to distance to the water, marsh (next to the water) with species such as Spartina foliosa and Sarcocornia pacifica; coastal sage scrub, and in the higher areas away from the water coniferous forest type trees such as pines, junipers, and calocedrus.


=== Fish ===
Different fish species have been documented in the reservoir, including exotic species such as threadfin shad (Dorosoma petenense), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), western mosquito fish (Gambusia affinis), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), and redbelly tilapia (Tilapia zillii).

Tony Knap,"Anthony Joseph Knap (December 8, 1914 – September 24, 2011) was an American football coach.  He was the head coach at Utah State University (1963–1966), Boise State University (1968–1975), and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (1976–1981). He compiled a career college football record of 143–53–4 (.725). Knap also worked as a high school teacher and coach, and served in the U.S. Navy during World War II.


== Early years and college ==
The oldest son of Polish immigrants, Knap was born and raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and graduated from Riverside High School (a.k.a. East), where he was an All-City selection in football in 1934. Along with three other Milwaukee freshman, he accepted a football scholarship to the University of Idaho in Moscow and played on the Vandals freshman team in the fall of 1935, then lettered for three seasons (1936–38) on the varsity under head coach Ted Bank. Among his UI teammates were future head coaches and administrators Lyle Smith and Steve Belko. Other teammates included future Idaho athletic director Leon Green, and NFL pros George ""Iron Man"" Thiessen (Rams), Stonko Pavkov (Steelers), Dean Green (Eagles), Richard ""Truck"" Trzuskowski (Lions), and Hal Roise (Bears).
As a senior in 1938, Knap was a second-team All-Coast selection at end, the only Vandal to make any of the three teams. The Vandals broke to an early 3–0–1 start in 1938 and there was early talk of the Rose Bowl in the national press. Three conference losses later, the Vandals finished the season at 6–3–1 (.650), Idaho's last winning season for a quarter century; not improved upon until 1971.
Knap was also a pitcher and utility player for three seasons on the varsity baseball team,
and a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.


== High school coach ==
After earning a bachelor's degree in education in 1939, Knap became a high school teacher and coach for three years in Bonners Ferry, just south of Canada. While waiting for his military commission following the outbreak of World War II, he spent a fall at Lewiston High School in 1942 as an assistant under former Vandal teammate Steve Belko. Knap served in the U.S. Navy, then returned to coaching after the war back in Idaho at Potlatch, near Moscow, and stayed with the Loggers until the summer of 1949.He attended a summer coaching clinic in 1949 in the Bay Area and was offered a head coaching position at Pittsburg High School in Pittsburg, California. Knap accepted and moved his family south to northern California. He stayed at the East Bay school for ten years, through the 1958 season; his overall record as a high school coach was 109–22–6 (.818).


== College coach ==


=== Utah State ===
Knap left Pittsburg to become an assistant coach at Utah State in 1959 under new coach John Ralston. He was credited with developing the big, agile lines which contributed to the Aggies' rise to national prominence. One of those lineman was Merlin Olsen, a future hall of famer in the NFL. (Olsen selected Knap for his presenter at the enshrinement ceremonies in 1982.)After posting a 26–3–1 (.883) regular season record in his final three years at USU, Ralston left Logan for Stanford after the 1962 season and Knap was quickly promoted to head coach, where he compiled a 25–14–1 (.638) record in four seasons, from 1963 to 1966. His 1965 team was 8–2, but the Aggies slipped to 4–6 in 1966. With mixed support from his administrators, Knap resigned in January 1967 to accept a position with the BC Lions in the Canadian Football League (CFL).In rivalry games, his Utah State teams were 3–1 against BYU for The Old Wagon Wheel and 2–2 against Utah in the Battle of the Brothers.


=== Boise State ===
The Lions had a woeful year in 1967, going 3–12–1 and finishing in last in the CFL's Western Division. Knap did not return for another season. Instead, he succeeded Lyle Smith as head coach at Boise College in 1968, soon to become ""Boise State College"" (and BSU in 1974).  Smith had just stepped down as head coach and as the athletic director, hired his former Vandal teammate. It was Boise's first year as an NAIA independent; it had previously competed in the junior college ranks. Two years later in 1970, the Broncos began play in the NCAA in Division II (then the ""College Division"") and the Big Sky Conference. Knap led the Broncos to a 71–19–1 (.786) record in eight years, including three ten-win seasons and three consecutive Big Sky titles (1973–75). His salary was $16,800 in 1971 and $18,800 in 1972.Knap led the Broncos to a 3–1–1 record against his alma mater in the first five games of the Boise State–Idaho rivalry.


=== UNLV ===
His success in Boise led him south to Las Vegas in 1976, where he coached UNLV for six seasons and compiled a 47–20–2 (.696) record, stepping down at age 67 after the 1981 season. UNLV made the Division II playoffs in his first season and moved up to Division I-A in 1978, his third season at the school.  While Knap was head coach, the Rebels played as an independent; UNLV joined the PCAA the following season in 1982.  He was inducted into UNLV's hall of fame in 1989.He led the Rebels to a 3–1 record over Nevada in the rivalry game for the Fremont Cannon. The game was not played in 1980, 1981, or 1982.


== Personal life ==

Daughters of the Dragon,"The Daughters of the Dragon are the duo of Colleen Wing and Misty Knight, fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. They first appeared as a team in Deadly Hands of Kung Fu #32 (January 1977)  in a story titled Daughters of the Dragon written by Chris Claremont and illustrated by Marshall Rogers. This followed the introduction of each individual character in mid-1970s Iron Fist stories.


== Publication history ==
The pair was first referred to by the name Daughters of the Dragon canonically in Marvel Team-Up #64 (December 1977). In the context of the story, the name comes from an attempted slight from Iron Fist foe Davos, the Steel Serpent, said in a tongue-in-cheek way while he flees from the two heroines. Despite the Daughters of the Dragon being given co-star billing in the issue, they appear in action for only a handful of panels, foreshadowing their status as perennial supporting characters who rarely starred in stories of their own. Since Iron Fist's first series had been cancelled at that time, the two characters followed him into the new Power Man and Iron Fist series (a merging of the Power Man and Iron Fist series), with Colleen and Misty as supporting cast, who operated Knightwing Restorations Inc.Among the few stories to feature the Daughters of the Dragon as the stars were 8-page stories appearing in Marvel Comics Presents #42 (January 1990), #80 (April 1991), and #149 (March 1994). The first two of these stories were written by former Power Man and Iron Fist writer Mary Jo Duffy.
In late 2005/early 2006 they gained a limited series which introduced both the style and many of the plots and characters that were later featured in the 2006 Heroes for Hire series.
The Daughters of the Dragon received an entry in the All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #3 (2006).
Misty Knight and Colleen Wing were featured in the Luke Cage and Iron Fist Netflix series, which take place in a shared universe. Both characters were eventually paired, as in the comic. The success of the duo led Marvel to launch a new Daughters of the Dragon comic in 2018, by Jed MacKay and Travel Foreman. It was released as a digital comic.


== In other media ==

A Daughters of the Dragon TV series was announced to be in development in 2001, but was never produced. The series would have featured Colleen Wing and two other members.
Misty Knight and Colleen Wing appear in Marvel's Netflix television series, portrayed by Simone Missick and Jessica Henwick, respectively. Following their introductions in Luke Cage and Iron Fist, the pair return in the miniseries The Defenders.

August 2021 Tokyo stabbings,"A mass stabbing incident occurred 6 August 2021, on a commuter train in the Odakyu Electric Railway in Tokyo, Japan. 10 people were injured in the incident.
The attacker, a 36-year-old man named Yusuke Tsushima, was arrested hours later at a convenience store. Police charged him in January 2022 with attempted murder, robbery and attempted robbery.Tsushima also tried to start a fire on the train's compartment, which ultimately failed.
The possibility of femicide was indicated, based on Tsushima's testimony.On 14 July 2023, Tsushima was sentenced to 19 years in prison.


== Background ==
Although Japan ranks amongst the countries with the lowest crimes rates, incidents of mass stabbings are not uncommon. In 2008, Tomohiro Katō, a 25-year-old man committed the Akihabara massacre, killing seven people. Eight years prior, Mamoru Takuma murdered eight children at an elementary school in the Osaka school massacre. In 2016, 26-year-old Satoshi Uematsu committed one of the most serious incidents of mass murder in Japan since World War II, when he stabbed 19 severely disabled people to death at a care center. Further incidents happened again in 2008 when Masahiro Kanagawa killed a man and injured scores of others with a knife and most recently, the Kawasaki stabbings in 2019, when a man, Ryuichi Iwasaki, 51, who self-identified as a hikikomori, killed two schoolchildren and injured 18 others at a bus stop before killing himself.
Two months after the attack, 24-year-old Kyota Hattori, who dressed as Joker, committed attempted murder and arson in a Keiō Line train at Chōfu in October, resulting in 17 passengers being injured.


== Incident ==
At around 8:30 pm (JST: UTC+9) on 6 August 2021, Yusuke Tsushima, aged 36, began stabbing people indiscriminately on a commuter train in Setagaya Ward. A 20-year-old female university student was attacked relentlessly and sustained serious injuries to her chest and back. The victims were 5 female and 5 male passengers in their 20s to 50s, including the female university student. Three women and one man were stabbed; the victims were injured when they were hit by a blade wielded by the man, excluding the female university student. The other victims were injured when they fell down while running away.The train was immediately halted and Tsushima spread cooking oil on the compartment's floor and tried to ignite a fire before escaping. Police rapidly responded to the incident, with a woman being transported to hospital with serious stab wounds to her chest and back.Tsushima, who had been suspected of shoplifting earlier in the day, remained at large amidst a manhunt for hours. He finally entered a convenience store hours after the incident in Suginami Ward and informed the store employee that he was the suspect saying ""I am the suspect in the incident reported by news media. I am tired of fleeing"". The store employee quickly informed police and Tsushima was apprehended.Although police opened an investigation, Tsushima was quoted as saying that he had been wanting to ""kill a happy woman for the past six years"" and added that the day of the incident ""anyone would have been OK"". He also stated that he thought ""he could kill a large number of people given there's no space to escape inside a train"".Tokyo Police charged him later with the attempted murder of the seriously injured woman and other charges. Tsushima is a native of Kawasaki, Kanagawa.On 8 August 2021, Tsushima was sent to the prosecutors, where he said that he was ultimately motivated to commit the crime when he faced online rejection from women and regretted that he had not killed anyone, quoted as saying that the fact that no one had died was ""unfortunate"" for him. He also said that his life was a misery and blamed society.


=== Plan to bomb Shibuya Crossing ===
On 10 August 2021, Tsushima reiterated his intent to target ""happy-looking couples"" in his attack and told police he considered bombing the famous Shibuya Crossing in Tokyo. Tsushima told investigators that he was willful in his intent to kill the seriously injured woman on the train because she looked like a ""winner"" in life. Police formally re-arrested him after the interrogation.


== Legal proceedings ==
On 28 January 2022, Tokyo prosecutors formally charged Tsushima with attempted murder, and a judge remanded him in custody, after finding him fully liable to respond to the charges. He was later also charged with robbery and attempted robbery.On 27 June 2023, Tsushima admitted to the attack but his lawyers stated that he had no murderous intent.On 14 July 2023, Tsushima was sentenced to 19 years in prison, with the presiding judge calling his motives ""selfish"" and the attack ""extremely malicious,"" which the judge said, ""left no room for leniency.""

François Kevorkian,"François Kevorkian (born 10 January 1954), also known by the stage name François K, is a French-born, U.S.-based DJ, producer, remixer and label owner of Armenian descent, who started his career DJing in clubs such as the Paradise Garage and Studio 54. Kevorkian has produced and remixed work by a diverse range of musicians including the Smiths, Adam Ant, Kraftwerk, Pet Shop Boys, Depeche Mode, Diana Ross, Gloria Estefan and U2, and is considered one of the forefathers of house music.


== Biography ==
François Kevorkian (Armenian: Ֆրանսուա Գեւորգեան) was born and raised in France, with Armenian heritage. He played the drums in his adolescent years. 
He moved to the United States in 1975. At that time the competition to be a drummer was very high, so around 1976 he became a DJ in underground clubs in New York City. DJing soon became his full-time occupation, including some work at more commercial venues such as the club New York, New York in 1977. He taught himself tape editing and started making disco medleys, such as Rare Earth's ""Happy Song"". He was offered a role in A&R for a nascent dance independent record label, Prelude Records, which allowed him to go into the studio and do remixes. His first remix, of ""In The Bush"" by Musique, became a club and radio hit, and was followed by further hit remixes including ""You're The One For Me' and ""Keep On"" by D-Train, and ""Beat The Street"" by Sharon Redd. He left Prelude in 1982, and in the same year had the most #1 singles on Billboard's Dance Music Chart, including his remixes of tracks such as ""Situation"" by Yazoo, and ""Go Bang"" by Dinosaur L.
Kevorkian also performed as a DJ at Club Zanzibar in Newark, New Jersey during the 1980s, home to the ""Jersey Sound"" brand of deep house or garage house.During this time he began building his own recording studio, Axis Studios, in the same building as Studio 54. The studio soon became a major commercial operation. He stopped DJing around 1983 to focus on recording and mixing full-time, but started again in early 1990. Due to the new international popularity of dance music, he gained exposure overseas and began performing abroad. He toured Japan with Larry Levan in 1992 on the 'Harmony Tour' before Levan's death in November that year, and also appeared at London's Ministry of Sound and Fabric, Japan's Spacelab Yellow, Ibiza's Pacha and Space, Italy's Angels of Love and many large festivals.
In 1995, he started an eclectic independent record label, Wave Music, on which he released his own work, including the FK-EP, as well as records by Abstract Truth, Floppy Sounds and other electronic music releases. In 1996, with partner John Davis, he launched Body&SOUL, a weekly party held every Sunday afternoon at Club Vinyl, 6 Hubert Street, playing alongside co-resident DJs Joaquin 'Joe' Claussell and Danny Krivit. The 'Body&SOUL' sound, a soulful mix of organic and spiritual dance music, led to the release of a compilation series by the same name.
He continued his career as an artist, returning to a more electronic sound, and the release of his Sonar Music set in 2002 marked an edgier and more futuristic style, more closely related to Techno and Dub than the House sound he was identified with as a DJ. In 2002, he also started touring with Derrick May, playing sets together as the Cosmic Twins at Berlin's Tresor, Manchester's Sankey's Soap and London's Fabric. Kevorkian released a new compilation CD in 2006, entitled Frequencies.
In April 2003, he started a residency at a new weekly Monday night event in New York City called ""Deep Space NYC"", an eclectic night focused on dub music and related styles. He mixed Deep Space NYC Vol. 1, a compilation featuring several of his own productions, along with Jamaican dub artists Mutabaruka and U-Roy. He also provided remixes for Moloko, Yoko Ono, Cesária Évora, Nina Simone, as well as for his own label. In 2005, he was inducted into the Dance Music Hall of Fame as both a remixer and DJ.
Kevorkian has subsequently performed at events around the world, including Midem (France), Sónar (Spain), Global Gathering (UK), Exit Festival (Serbia), The Big Chill (UK), Bestival (UK) and Electric Picnic (Ireland).

John Frederick McCrea,"John Frederick McCrea VC (2 April 1854 – 16 July 1894) was an English-born South African soldier and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.


== Early life ==
McCrea was born on 2 April 1854 at Saint Peter Port, Guernsey to Captain Herbert Taylor McCrea and Elizabeth Dobree Carey. Following his parents' deaths in 1855, he was brought up by his aunt Charlotte in Guernsey and educated at Elizabeth College. He then studied medicine at Guy's Hospital, qualifying in 1878 as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England and Edinburgh.In 1879 he went to South Africa, where he did duty at the Military Hospital in Cape Town as Civilian Surgeon to Her Majesty's Forces. A year later he moved to Fort Beaufort, Eastern Cape to settle, but decided instead to join the 1st Regiment, Cape Mounted Yeomanry as a surgeon.


== Details ==
McCrea was 26 years old, and a Surgeon in the 1st Cape Mounted Yeomanry, Cape Colonial Forces during the Basuto Gun War, when he performed the following actions for which he was awarded the VC.
On 14 January 1881, at Tweefontein, Basutoland, South Africa, the burghers had been forced to retire under a most determined enemy attack, with a loss of 16 killed and 21 wounded. Surgeon McCrea was the only doctor present and notwithstanding a serious wound on the breast bone, which he dressed himself, he most gallantly took the casualties into shelter and continued to attend to the wounded throughout the day. Had it not been for this devotion to duty on the part of Surgeon McCrea, there would undoubtedly have been much greater suffering and loss of life.

HIV superinfection,"HIV superinfection (also called HIV reinfection or SuperAIDS) is a condition in which a person with an established human immunodeficiency virus infection acquires a second strain of HIV, often of a different subtype. These can form a recombinant strain that co-exists with the strain from the initial infection, as well from reinfection with a new virus strain, and may cause more rapid disease progression or carry multiple resistances to certain HIV medications.
HIV superinfection may be interclade, where the second infecting virus is phylogenetically distinct from the initial virus, or intraclade, where the two strains are monophyletic.People with HIV risk superinfection by the same actions that would place a non-infected person at risk of acquiring HIV. These include sharing needles and forgoing condoms with HIV-positive sexual partners. Cases have been reported globally and studies have shown the incidence rate to be 0–7.7% per year. Research from Uganda published in 2012 indicates that HIV superinfection among HIV-infected individuals within a general population remains unknown. Further research indicates that there have been 16 documented cases of superinfection since 2002.If a person is infected with a second virus before seroconversion to the first virus has taken place, it is termed a dual infection. Infection with a second strain after seroconversion is known as superinfection.


== Immunology ==
A study conducted in Kenya in 2007 shows that superinfection tends to occur during the course of the initial infection, that is during acute infection, or 1–5 years after initial infection, but not during the latency period. Thus, superinfection occurs after an immune response to the initial infection has already been established.It is unknown what aspects of the natural immune response to HIV may protect someone from superinfection, but it has been shown that cytotoxic lymphocyte responses do not seem to be protective. Immune responses to initial infection with a particular strain of HIV do not provide protection against superinfection with a different strain. The effect of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) is also unknown, but it has been shown that individuals with HIV tend not to have a NAb response prior to superinfection.In addition, it has been demonstrated that superinfection can occur in individuals that demonstrate a robust anti-HIV antibody response. The anti-HIV antibody response broadens and strengthens in individuals post-superinfection. The finding that superinfection occurs within and between HIV subtypes suggests that an immune response to initial HIV infection provide limited protection against infection by a new viral strain. This means that HIV-vaccine strategies made to replicate the host's immune response to HIV infection may not prevent new infections.Studies indicate that superinfection causes a spike in HIV viral load and a decrease in CD4+ cell count similar to those reported during primary HIV infection. Early studies of HIV superinfection analysed these spikes to diagnose cases of superinfection. It is unclear whether superinfection causes a sustained increase in viral load. The effect of superinfection on the progression of HIV infection is unclear because of its ambiguous effects on surrogate markers for the disease, such as an increase in viral load or a decrease in CD4 cell count. The potential of superinfection to cause rapid disease progression depends on viral and host factors.Cases of superinfection are yet to be identified in sufficient numbers to conduct detailed studies on the effect of superinfection on the host immune response.


== Causes ==
HIV superinfection is distinct from HIV dual infection, where an individual is simultaneously infected with multiple distinct viral strains. HIV superinfection involves an individual with HIV being infected by a new, phylogenetically distinct HIV strain. Early reports of HIV superinfection were observed in cases of co-infection with HIV-1 and HIV-2.Studies have shown that a lack of neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 infection predisposes patients to superinfection. Additionally, the tendency of HIV-1 virions to recombine when two subtypes infect a single cell increases its susceptibility to HIV superinfection. Further evidence of superinfection stems from the fact that nearly 10% of HIV-1 infections are associated with a transmittable recombinant strain. HIV-1 virions are divided into nine subtypes, all of which are characterized by different rates of disease progression, viral load and sensitivity to assays used in detection. When a single cell is infected by two HIV-1 subtypes, they recombine, forming a new, transmittable recombinant strain.


== Mechanism ==


=== Loss of immune control ===
Following initial acute HIV infection, CD8+ T-cells control viral replication and maintain it at a viral set point. Following superinfection, CD8+ T-cells lose control over replication and it deviates from the set point. The mechanism responsible for this is unknown. A weakened T-cell response against the initial virus enables the superinfecting strain to resist immune control, resulting in an increased replication rate and subsequent viremia. Increased viral load and a declining T-cell response enables the superinfecting strain to recombine rapidly, further decreasing immune control.


=== Recombination ===
HIV virions each contain a double-stranded RNA genome. When superinfection occurs, cells contain two different HIV strains. These can exchange genetic material such that an RNA strand from each strain is contained in a single virion. As this progeny virion infects new cells, the RNA template transcribed by viral reverse transcriptase changes, resulting in a reverse transcript with genetic material from both parental viruses. Recombination results in a rapid increase in HIV viral diversity, causing quicker adaptations to host immune response and resistance to ART. Recombination tends to produce two distinct recombinant forms, the presence of which are used as evidence of dual infection. The high prevalence of interclade recombinants increases the likelihood of superinfection being more widespread than reported.


==== Circulating recombinant forms ====
Circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) are mosaic viruses - recombinants with randomly assorted genetic material from phylogenetically distinct parental viruses. They spread geographically through human propagation, for example CRF02_AG, which is found in west and central Africa, as well as South America. CRFs account for 10% of HIV infections worldwide. There are 15 known CRFs, reported on four continents. More recombinants are likely to arise in regions with a growing HIV epidemic and where viral clades intersect, including Africa, Southeast Asia and South America.


==== Unique recombinant forms ====
Unique recombinant forms (URFs) are mosaic viruses that have not spread geographically. They are also reported in areas where multiple viral clades intersect.In 2004, a study by AIDS on sex workers in Nairobi, Kenya, reported URF generation in a woman initially infected with clade A, and then nine years later acquired clade C, which recombined with the initial infecting virus to form a recombinant of clades A and C that fully replaced the parental clade A virions.


== Diagnosis ==
Initial reports solely documented interclade superinfection, where patients are infected by a virus of a different clade from the initial virus. This is because the viruses in initial cases were all subtypes of HIV-1, with at least a 30% difference in nucleotides in their envelope proteins that makes such superinfections easier to detect.Superinfection is identified by the detection of viral recombinants for phylogenetically distinct parent strains.Multiregion hybridisation assays are used to identify interclade superinfection by detecting genetic differences between parental and progeny strains. Heteroduplex mobility assays can be used to sequence viral genetic material, allowing the detection of samples with a genetic difference exceeding 1.5%.Bulk sequencing is used to amplify viral RNA to enable the identification of new phylogenetic species in a patient over time. However, this method is poor at detecting genetic differences at levels of 20% of lower.A third method, next-generation-sequencing assays, was developed in 2005. It enables the rapid sequencing and screening of genomes, detecting genetic differences of 1% or less.There are no known methods to estimate the timing of superinfection.


== Prognosis ==
Studies on individuals with superinfection with two strains of HIV showed a poorer prognosis. Superinfection is correlated with a faster progression of the HIV infection. Patients in studies have displayed a shorter lag between seroconversion and experiencing an AIDS-defining clinical condition or death. However, it is unclear whether this rapid conversion is a direct effect of superinfection, or a result of a weaker immune response to the virus caused by superinfection.


== Epidemiology ==
It is difficult to gain accurate estimations of the frequency of HIV superinfection because most studies are performed on patients infected with the HIV-1 B subtype, and recombinant strains are difficult to distinguish from the original strain for this subtype.HIV superinfection has been reported in the US, Canada, Europe, Australia, Asia, and Africa. Data on the prevalence of superinfection has been gathered from case reports and observational studies, suggesting that it is underreported.Initial care reports and observational studies of superinfection were in men who have sex with men, intravenous drug users and female sex workers. Incidence in heterosexual populations was first reported in rural Africa.Incidence rates have been reported as 0% to 7.7% annually, although this varies across populations and depends on the frequency of antiretroviral drug use, the length of the follow-up period, and the method used to detect superinfection. However, a study in Uganda conducted using next-generation deep sequencing assays found that the rate of superinfection was large enough to be comparable to the primary HIV infection rate.Risk factors for superinfection are not clearly understood because of the small number of cases documented. However, the risk factors for primary infection are considered to apply to superinfection, including:

high number of sexual partners
limited condom use
no antiretroviral use
detectable plasma viral load
absence of male circumcision
non-marital relationshipsThe results of studies modeling the effect of HIV superinfection on viral recombination have suggested that superinfection has been instrumental in spurring community recombination rates. However, these studies were based on several epidemiological assumptions that are yet to be verified. These include assumptions about the pattern of HIV-1 transmission and that superinfection causes transmission to uninfected sexual partners.


== History ==
1987 - First evidence of superinfection reported in studies of chimpanzees.1991 - HIV-1 found to superinfect HIV-2-infected cells in a study through inducing infection in cells cultured from HIV patient samples.1999 - In pig tailed macaques, a ""window of susceptibility"" demonstrated by showing that superinfection with a new viral strain was only possible after initial infection in macaques.2002 - First definitive study on superinfection after cases reported in IV drug users in Bangkok, Thailand. The initial cases were all interclade superinfections.2003 - Intraclade infection by an immune response to one strain of HIV-1 cannot prevent superinfection with a second virus from the same clade.2005 - The ability of HIV superinfection to cause ART resistance.


== Implications for treatment and care ==


=== Drug resistance ===
Because of viral recombination, superinfection patients infected with at least one drug-resistant strain are likely to develop a mosaic recombinant strain with multi-drug resistance. This lowers the potential success of ART. Additionally, the existence of multiple strains of the virus in a host enhances interclade and intraclade recombination, accelerating global virus diversification for HIV.


=== Impact on vaccine development ===
Research on the development of an HIV-1 vaccine has sought to replicate virus-specific CD8+ T-cell responses, which play a role in the control of HIV-1 replication. Superinfection case reports have shown that superinfecting strains generally had different viral epitopes from the initial infecting cell. An immune response to the initial infection would, therefore, be ineffective against the super-infecting strain, leading to the proliferation of the superinfecting strain.An HIV-1 vaccine designed to recognize specific viral epitopes would be ineffective as it would not provide protection against HIV-1 viruses that do not share the same epitope. Such an ineffective vaccine could also lead to faster disease progression than in unvaccinated individuals. A successful vaccine would, therefore, have to incorporate viral epitopes derived from several viral subtypes.


=== Impact on clinical care ===
Increasing rates of antiretroviral therapy (ART) use have led to concerns about the development of drug-resistant strains which could be transmitted through superinfection. Individuals with drug-resistant strains are vulnerable to superinfection with a susceptible strain of the virus, reversing the effect of ART's the clinical aspects of HIV infection. Individuals with HIV were found to have a sudden increase in viral load, or a decrease in CD4 count should be tested for a resistant viral strain to identify the resistance profile of the secondary strain.Sexual practices, such as serosorting, place individuals with HIV infection at a higher risk of superinfection and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). HIV positive individuals engaging in unprotected sex with seroconcordant partners require counseling on the risks of superinfection and STDs, both of which are expressed more virulently because of immunosuppression in HIV patients. Counselling for HIV patients on the risk of HIV superinfection, and encouraging safe sexual and injection practices, have shown an improvement in safer sexual practices, reducing the risk of superinfection.

==== Week 1: at Pittsburgh Steelers ====

The Steelers were on a disappointing run; Tennessee took advantage of this in 2012 and beat them at home by a score of 26-23, despite finishing at 6-10, while the Steelers went 8-8. In 2013, the Titans traveled to Pittsburgh for their season opener against the rival Steelers. They got off to a strong start, scoring a touchdown and 3 field goals for a 16-2 lead, as the Steelers could only manage a safety. In the fourth quarter, the Steelers cut the Titans' lead to 16-9 after they scored a touchdown. However, Tennessee ran out the clock, ensuring themselves a victory. With the convincing win, the Titans started the season at 1-0, but since the Colts beat the Raiders, 21-17, and the Texans later defeated the Chargers, 31-28, Tennessee tied for 1st place in the AFC South, since the Jacksonville Jaguars were humiliated, 28-2, at home by the Kansas City Chiefs.


==== Week 2: at Houston Texans ====


==== Week 3: vs. San Diego Chargers ====

For the first time since 1992 the Titans franchise defeated the Chargers, winning on a 34-yard touchdown throw from Jake Locker to Justin Hunter with 15 seconds to go.  Locker finished with 367 all-purpose yards – 299 passing yards, 68 rushing yards.  Chris Johnson finished with 90 rushing yards.


==== Week 4: vs. New York Jets ====

The Titans forced four Jets turnovers; Jake Locker threw three touchdowns off turnovers as the Titans led 24–6 at the half.  Locker was knocked out of the game in the third quarter following hits from Muhammad Wilkerson and Quinton Coples, suffering a right hip injury; a subsequent MRI showed no major damage to Locker's hip and he was sidelined for the next two games.  Ryan Fitzpatrick finished the game, throwing a 77-yard score to Nate Washington.  Geno Smith of the Jets was intercepted twice, but the most-popularized play came when he fumbled behind his back at the Titans goalline and Karl Klug fell on the touchdown.  Tennessee won 38–13.


==== Week 5: vs. Kansas City Chiefs ====


==== Week 6: at Seattle Seahawks ====


==== Week 7: vs. San Francisco 49ers ====


==== Week 9: at St. Louis Rams ====

The game was the first meeting between the Titans and their former coach, Jeff Fisher, and the first game for the club since the passing of its founder, Bud Adams. For the first time in 7 years, it was also quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick's first return to St. Louis since he was traded from the Rams following the 2006 season. Fitzpatrick played his first 2 seasons in and was drafted 250th overall by St. Louis in 2005. The game lead tied or changed on every score as the Titans erupted to 198 rushing yards and four touchdowns on the ground.   Chris Johnson scored twice amid 170 all-purpose yards (150 on the ground) while Jake Locker overcame two interceptions to throw for 185 yards and run in a six-yard score.


==== Week 10: vs. Jacksonville Jaguars ====


==== Week 11: vs. Indianapolis Colts ====


==== Week 12: at Oakland Raiders ====


==== Week 13: at Indianapolis Colts ====


==== Week 14: at Denver Broncos ====

There was a rebellion in 1950, and armed conflict continued to erupt in the 1980s to 2000s. Since 1989, the armed rebellion was mostly led by the National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT) and the All Tripura Tiger Force ATTF).
The Bengali side retaliated by forming militias of their own, such as the United Bengali Liberation Tiger Front (UBLTF), which destroyed a number of Tripuri villages in 2000.The NLFT is classified by the National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism as one of the ten most active terrorist groups in the world, and has been accused of forcefully converting people to Christianity.Militant activity peaked in 2000 with 514 terrorism-related fatalities in that year. As of 2012, the uprising has largely been brought under control by the authorities through security actions and negotiated surrenders.

Commo,"Commo is a telecommunications program which was written and maintained from 1989 to 1998 by Fred P. Brucker.  It was a macro-driven package and could be customized by the user.  The program, written in optimized assembly language and  distributed as shareware, was small and fast.
The macro language used by Commo was simple, with assembly language-like statements surrounded by curly braces.  It offered the ability to control most aspects of the terminal.  For instance, the following macro would reconfigure the Alt-X key to display a dialog box, allowing the user to confirm before exiting the program:
{:alx} {info-qs0 Really exit?}

{ifco ,alxn} {exit} {:alxn} {}The program's macro and configuration files were free-form text which could be edited with any text editor.  This led to popularity among those who wanted to be able to configure the program.
Fred Brucker actively provided support for screen readers to work with COMMO, which made it a popular program for the visually impaired. The Powermacros add-on made COMMO one of the first Trade Wars 2002 'helper' programs. MacroBBS was a Bulletin board system written entirely out of COMMO macros.
Mr. Brucker released the last version of COMMO on 25 December 1998.

Jon Jarl,"Jon Jarl was a Swedish jarl at the end of the 12th and in the early 13th centuries. He is mentioned in Eric's Chronicle from the 1320s to have spent years fighting against Russians and Ingrians in the early Swedish-Novgorodian Wars.
According to 15th-century historian Ericus Olai, he was murdered at his home in Asknäs in Ekerö parish by the Lake Mälaren in 1206, allegedly by Russian pirates.According to the Eric's Chronicle, Jon Jarl was a Swedish earl in the east tasked with the protection of the kingdom against Russians and Ingrians. Sven Tunberg considers it likely that the earl belonged to the Sverker family and that he was King Sverker the Younger's ""Finnish earl"" for nine years.


== Death According to Eric's Chronicle ==
According to the Eric's Chronicle, after being away for nine years, Jon Jarl was killed on his farm at Askanäs on Ekerö by Karelian or Russian pirates the same night that he returned from a crusade between Ingrians and Russians.
The Chronicle states:

They caught up and fought them off at ""Eesta skär"" (i.e. Estbröte, a high islet in the fairway between Ekerö and Johannesdal, in the southwest of Stockholm).
How accurately the chronicle reproduces the actual sequence of events is unclear.

Klement of Ruszcza,"Klement of Ruszcza (Polish: Klemens z Ruszczy, Klemens Ruszczaski) was a Polish nobleman and Voivode of Kraków in 1241 and from 1243 to 1252.


== Life ==
Klement was born to Sulisław from the Gryfici (Świebodzice) noble family in the House of Griffins. After the Wendish Crusade, the Turko-Mongol invasion of Poland and the subsequent German colonisation of Silesia the Gryfici (Świebodzice) clan lost most of their possessions in White Serbia, Duchy of Kopanica, Branibor and Lower Silesia. The Germanised Pomeranian branch of the family became known as House of Griffins.
In 1228 he obtained rights to the village of Lutowice, Zagórze (Sosnowiec), Zator, and Woźniki. Klement founded a settlement on the river Koprzywianka which he named Klimontów, after himself and another site Klimontów (Sosnowiec) next to Zagórze and Będzin. For a time he was Castellan of Kraków.
In March 1241 he succeeded his uncle as Voivode of Kraków after the death of Włodzimierz at the Battle of Chmielnik. Kraków was sacked a week later by the Turko-Mongols. His father Sulisław and most of the Polish high nobles, including Henry II the Pious, were killed at the Battle of Legnica. The new Duke of Poland Bolesław II Rogatka, successor to Henry II, confirmed his post as Voivode. Konrad Mazowiecki, the Duke of Masovia, attacked Kraków the same year and Klement and the Cracovians were left to defend Kraków alone without help from the Silesian princes, which they abandoned in July in favor of Skała. A few months later the fortress of Skała fell to Konrad and Klement capitulated and fled to Hungary.
He returned to Lesser Poland in 1243 with Hungarian troops, incl. members of the Sarmatian Zych (Záh) clan, with the aim of putting Bolesław Wstydliwy on the throne of Kraków. His army gathered other Polish knights who advocated for the placement of Bolesław and together they clashed with the army of Konrad and the Masovians at the Battle of Suchodoł in May 1243. After this victory Bolesław took control of Kraków, a move supported by Bishop Jan Prandota. Klement rebuilt the Będzin Castle (near Zagórze and Klimontów) and a Zych garrison protecting the silver mines of Rosperk was placed at nearby Zychcych (Żychcice).
Because of his successes Klement's previous position as Voivode was restored to him. In 1252 he received  a privilege from Bolesław Wstydliwy, releasing him and his descendants from all levies and burdens for the benefit of the ruling house, moreover the right of trial and the privilege of building castles and serving other princes.
He died in 1256.

Home zone,"A home zone (or play street) is a living street (or group of streets) as implemented in the United Kingdom, which are designed primarily to meet the needs of pedestrians, cyclists, children and residents and where the speeds and dominance of cars is reduced. Quiet lanes are a similar concept in rural areas.


== History ==

The Highway Act 1835 banned the playing of football and street games on the highway with a maximum penalty of forty shillings (£177.62 as of 2015). In 1860 Taverner John Miller, MP for Colchester reported to the House of Commons that in the previous year 44 children had been sent to prison in London and Middlesex for failure to pay fines for playing in the street, highlighting the case of a 12-year-old boy sent to prison for 5 days for playing rounders. In 1925 Nancy Astor MP noted in the Commons that ""There is no more pitiable sight in life than a child which has been arrested for playing in the street"". By 1935 over 2,000 young people under the age of seventeen are prosecuted for playing in the streets.In 1934 Leslie Hore-Belisha became Transport Minister and initiated a number of road safety schemes in response the rising number of Road Casualties in Great Britain; these included the zebra crossing and a proposal to introduce play streets to the UK, which had been successfully operating in the USA. Following a trial of 200 Play Streets in Manchester and Salford from 1936, the Street Playground Act 1938 allowed councils to designate streets as playgrounds where games could be played.
In 1957 the Transport Minister was asked in the Commons if he was aware that playground streets regulations were being ignored and were frequently used by through traffic; the Minister responded saying that the size of Playground Streets signs had recently been increased in size to make them more prominent. Play street legislation was included in section 49 of the Road Traffic Act 1960.By 1963 there were 750 such streets around the country, but there was also growing conflict between the needs of children and the needs of motorists. In that year Ernest Marples, the Transport minister, was asked in the Commons if he could make a statement about the issue of car parking in play streets; he responded by indicating that he had only occasionally received complaints about parking issues in play streets. In the same year a petition was presented in the Commons from residents objecting to the illegal use of their playground street in Westminster being used by through-traffic and by people parking cars By contrast, the minister was also questioned in the Commons about a recently approved Playgrounds Street Order for a number of streets in Newcastle which was reported to have been opposed by all residents. In 1976 Trevor Huddleston, the Bishop of Stepney commented that Britain appeared to prefer motor cars to children 'by cluttering up Play Streets with parked cars'. By the 1980s Playgrounds Streets had been largely forgotten; there were streets which retained the signage and accompanying traffic restrictions, however residents' parked cars left no space for play.


== Current legislation ==


=== Home Zone ===
The main enabling legislation for home zones is given in section 268 of the Transport Act 2000 which allows the creation of 'use orders' which are orders that 'permit the use of a road for purposes other than passage' such as social interaction and children's play. In 2002 Farley Bank, a cul-de-sac in Hastings was designated as a Play Street giving children traffic-free space for play between 8am and sunset.


=== Quiet Lane ===
The same act introduced the concept of the Quiet Lane which allows similar social uses in rural roads, following pilot projects in Kent and Norfolk.


== Principles ==
These principles are similar to those of the shared space type schemes, which apply also to a wider range of environments and follow closely the pattern of the Dutch woonerf schemes.
Encouraging children's play is an important aim of many home zone schemes. Home zones have a very good safety record, but are not primarily designed as road safety schemes.
Home zones are encouraged by the UK Government as part of new residential areas. Although it is not possible for prospective residents to be involved in the design of new streets, steps can be taken to involve them in their maintenance and management.  Residents must be need to be consulted by the local Traffic Authority on the precise uses that can take place on the street (specified through a 'Use Order') and the appropriate speed of traffic on the street (specified through a 'Speed Order') before the home zone can be legally designated and signed.
Home zones often involved the use of shared space, where the street is not strongly divided into exclusive pedestrian and traffic areas.  Concerns have been expressed over the inability of blind and partially sighted people to use shared space streets.  Providing a clear route for pedestrians that is kept free of traffic, by using street furniture for example, is one way of meeting the needs of the visually impaired.
Well-designed home zones often include features such as benches, tables and play equipment to encourage social interaction.  Street trees and areas of planting, ideally maintained by residents, will often feature. On-street parking also forms part of the layout in most schemes.
Traffic speeds are kept low – with a typical target speed being around 20 km/h (10–15 mph) – through the overall design of the street and features such as sharp changes of direction for traffic and narrowings where only one motor vehicle can pass at a time.  Traditional traffic calming features such as road humps can also be used, but should be integrated into the design rather than being added as an engineered afterthought.
Examples of UK practice include Staiths South Bank in Gateshead, which at over 600 homes was the largest newbuild home zone development in the UK at the time it received planning consent. Most contemporary UK schemes have involved public realm works to existing streets in older Victorian housing areas, often to meet regeneration or traffic calming objectives.

Norwalk rail accident,"The Norwalk rail accident occurred on May 6, 1853, in Norwalk, Connecticut, and was the first major U.S. railroad bridge disaster; 48 were killed when a train travelling at 50 miles per hour (80 km/h) plunged into the Norwalk Harbor off of an open swing bridge.The accident occurred on the New York and New Haven Railroad where it crosses a small inlet of Long Island Sound via a swing bridge. The approach from New York is around a sharp curve, so there was a signal indicating if the bridge was passable by trains: a red ball mounted upon a tall pole.
At 08:00 that morning, the Boston express left New York with 200 passengers driven by a substitute driver for whom this was the third transit of the route. The train consisted of two baggage and five passenger cars. On approaching the bridge, the driver neglected to check the signal and only became aware that the bridge was open when within 400 feet (120 m) of it. The bridge had been opened for the passage of the steamship Pacific, which had just passed through. The driver applied the brakes and reversed the engine, but was unable to stop in time. He and the fireman leapt clear before the bridge and escaped serious injury. The engine itself flew across the 60-foot (18 m) gap, striking the opposite abutment some 8 feet (2.4 m) below the level of the track and sinking into 12 feet (3.7 m) of water. The baggage cars came to rest atop the locomotive; the front of the first passenger car was crushed against the baggage cars and then submerged as the second passenger car came to rest on top of it. The third passenger car broke in two; the front half hanging down over the edge of the abutment; the rear remaining on the track. Most of the 48 dead and 30 injured were in the first passenger car. A further eight people were reported missing.
Many doctors were travelling on the train, returning from the Sixth Annual Meeting of the American Medical Association in New York; seven of them were killed. Amongst the unhurt was Dr. Gurdon Wadsworth Russell, who wrote an account of the accident for the Hartford Courant in which he says that the dead ""presented all the symptoms of asphyxia from drowning, and were probably drowned at once, being confined and pressed by broken cars. Oh, what a melancholy scene that!""
The coroner's jury found the engineer primarily responsible for the disaster, and he was prosecuted for manslaughter, but acquitted.As a result of the public panic and indignation caused by the accident, a bill was introduced in the Connecticut Legislature establishing a powerful state Board of Railroad Commissioners. However, in the version actually enacted, the board's enforcement powers were removed, as well as a requirement that every train in the state would have to come to a dead halt before crossing any opening bridge.  The railroad, however, adopted such a policy on its own.A similar accident occurred eleven years later in Canada with even greater loss of life, the St-Hilaire train disaster.

== History ==
Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries possession of Saint Lucia was contested between France and England. Possession of Saint Lucia swapped hands between the two nations 14 times. Saint Lucia was finally ceded by the French to the English in 1814. Saint Lucia was granted self governance in 1967, and then independence in 1979.Saint Lucia formed its National Olympic Committee in 1987. Saint Lucia's NOC was officially recognized by the International Olympic Committee on 24 September, 1993. As of 2012 Saint Lucia had competed four Olympics since their debut at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, United States.


== Athletics ==

Athletes from Saint Lucia have so far achieved qualifying standards in the following athletics events (up to a maximum of 3 athletes in each event at the 'A' Standard, and 1 at the 'B' Standard):
Saint Lucia was represented by one male and one female athlete at the 2012 Summer Olympics in athletics. Darvin Edwards represented the nation in the men's high jump while Levern Spencer represented the nation in the women's high jump. This was the first Olympic appearance for Edwards, and the second appearance Spencer who had previously competed at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China.

B.T.R. (band),"B.T.R. is a Bulgarian metal band, founded in 1984. 


== History ==


=== Formation & Early Years (1984 - 1993) ===
B.T.R. was established in 1984 and broke up in 1986. During its early years nearly thirty musicians played with the band.  B.T.R. played live for the first time at a rock festival in Troyan, Bulgaria in 1990. In their first album, the band consisted of Hristo Angov (vocals), Valentine Guevski (guitar), Kiril Bozhkov (guitar), Ivan Kalfov (bass), and Georgi Milev (drums). Their first album was released by Riva Sound as a live album, with a performance which took place at the Valentin Andreev Hall on January 29,1992. In 1993 B.T.R. released their first studio album, ""Bending the Rules"". The album consisted of powerful heavy metal tracks and melodic ballads. It was distributed by Unison - RTM and became one of Bulgaria's best-selling albums in 1993.


=== New members & International Success (1993 - 2004) ===
Since 1993 B.T.R. consisted of Kiril Bojkov (guitar), Ivan Kalfov (vocals, bass guitar), Ilian Dikov (drums), Slavcho Nikolov (guitar, vocals) and Atanas ""Nasko"" Penev (vocals). Their first album with this lineup was ""Feel the Life"" and it consisted of traditional heavy metal tracks. Following extensive promotion in small clubs and concert halls, the band made an impression in France and had positive reception amongst the French fans. B.T.R.'s arrival in Nice coincided with the soccer victory of Bulgaria over France, and the band was later invited to play soccer with the semi-professional University of Nice soccer team.
In 1994 the band was invited to play in F.R.A.C.A, a large musical forum in Southern France in which over 20 bands perform. A year later, the band opened for Iron Maiden in Sofia.


=== Mainstream success ===
In 1997, ""B.T.R. '97"" was released, which was a significant step forward for the band. The album was actually recorded in 1996, but not released until a year after. Amongst the songs was perhaps one of B.T.R.'s most recognized songs, ""Elmaz i Staklo"" (Diamond and Glass).  Following the critical success of ""'97"", the band was again invited to perform in the French festival ""Cosmopoliten"", featuring various international acts.

1998 marked the release of the hit single Salvation, their most acclaimed song to date. The song became an anthem of the anti-drug movement in Bulgaria and received considerable airtime on radio stations all over the country. December of the same year the album 7 Ballads was released, which includes Salvation and various songs from Feel The Life, but all in Bulgarian. The album was also the first Bulgarian Enhanced Audio CD and features music videos for Salvation and Elmaz i Staklo, as well as interviews from all the band members.
In 1999 the band recorded Dreams. It differs from previous albums in style, and features more complex compositions, as well as a more melodic style, with more developed lyrics. Their first single Flower from the Moon was an instant success. Both the album and the single reached the number one spot in many different billboards across the country. The album followed with extensive touring, different sponsors (over 30 gigs), and many of the venues being sold out.
In the year 2000 the band continued their touring and opened in the Romanian festival Golden Stag with bands INXS and UB40. At the end of the year, the band also made another appearance in China.
In 2002 they released The Game, followed by their most well-known performance, in the National Palace of Culture with a special guest Glenn Hughes, the bass player of Deep Purple. Together they played some of Deep Purple's biggest hits, such as Stormbringer and Mistreated. The concert also featured a symphonic orchestra for two of their songs.
From 2003 onwards, the band has played countless shows in many countries, and has also played in Beijing, recording Meet in Beijing. B.T.R. also visited Vietnam where a recorded show of the band was watched by over 50 million Vietnamese people.


== New Developments ==
In 2008 the band released Deja Vu, which contains covers of famous Bulgarian rock songs. They are also chosen as band of the year by Bulgarian audiences.
In 2009 they toured in over 13 cities in Bulgaria.
On March 15, 2014 the band played a concert in Toronto, Canada.

Theta correspondence,"In mathematics, the theta correspondence or Howe correspondence is a mathematical relation between representations of two groups of a reductive dual pair. The local theta correspondence relates irreducible admissible representations over a local field, while the global theta correspondence relates irreducible automorphic representations over a global field.
The theta correspondence was introduced by Roger Howe in Howe (1979). Its name arose due to its origin in André Weil's representation theoretical formulation of the theory of theta series in Weil (1964). The Shimura correspondence as constructed by Jean-Loup Waldspurger in Waldspurger (1980) and Waldspurger (1991) may be viewed as an instance of the theta correspondence.

Valsgärde,"Valsgärde or Vallsgärde is a farm on the Fyris river, about three kilometres north of Gamla Uppsala, the ancient centre of the Swedish kings and of the pagan faith in Sweden. The present farm dates from the 16th century. The farm's notability derives from the presence of a burial site from the Swedish Vendel Age (part of the Iron Age (c. 550–793) and the Viking Age); it was used for more than 300 years. The first ship burial is from the 6th century and the last graves are from the 11th century.


== Excavation ==
The site was found and excavated by archaeologists in the 1920s, and before this similar graves had only been found at Vendel, which gave its name to this period of the Scandinavian Iron Age. The graves are princely, and are almost identical to ones found in England, at Sutton Hoo in East Anglia dated probably to 610–635. There are several theories about the identities of those buried, ranging from the Ynglings (Scylfings) to powerful warriors within the Leidang system, or local strongmen who had enriched themselves through trade due to the area's strategic position between the fjord of Mälaren and the important region of Tiundaland.  There are so many rich graves that it is likely that most of them were royalty.

Susan Jacks,"Susan Jacks (née Pesklevits; 19 August 1948 – 25 April 2022) was a Canadian singer-songwriter and record producer.


== Career ==
Susan Pesklevits was born on 19 August 1948 to a family of eight children in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Her family moved to British Columbia when she was nine, settling in  Haney. She began her professional career at 15 when she was asked to be a regular performer on the national Canadian television show, Music Hop.She also appeared on several other national television shows and regularly did live performances in the British Columbia and Alberta areas. She recorded her first singles with two other well known Vancouver performers, Howie Vickers and Tom Northcott, under the name of ""The Eternal Triangle"".In 1966, 18-year-old Susan Pesklevits asked Terry Jacks to accompany her on guitar for an upcoming appearance. Susan performed a small number of dates with Terry accompanying her on guitar. They decided to add Craig McCaw on lead guitar and, although she continued to make various solo television appearances, Susan made the decision to stop performing live as a solo artist, left the ""Eternal Triangle"" and dedicated her time to the newly formed trio. The trio used the name ""Powerline"" for a number of months before settling on the name ""The Poppy Family"". Susan and Terry married in 1967. Craig McCaw introduced Satwant Singh to the group and he soon joined the trio on tablas.The group began recording as ""The Poppy Family featuring Susan Jacks"" and had a number of hits from 1968 through the early 1970s. ""Which Way You Goin' Billy?"", originally called ""Which Way You Goin' Buddy?"", was written from a male perspective but was re-written at Susan's suggestion to be sung by a female. Susan's brother Billy's name was chosen to replace ""Buddy"" and the song went on to sell nearly four million copies worldwide, hitting No. 1 in Canada, No. 1 in Cashbox and No. 2 in Billboard in the United States. ""That's Where I Went Wrong"" and ""Where Evil Grows"" also charted well on Billboard. They consequently followed up with numerous hits in Canada.
Terry released Satwant Singh and Craig McCaw from the group in 1970 and, although the name Poppy Family was still used, Susan essentially became a solo artist, with the exception of one or two duets with Terry. She often performed Poppy Family hits on television shows including Rollin' On The River, The Bobby Darin Show and The George Kirby Special.In 1972, the Poppy Family name was dropped and Susan and Terry worked together in the studio to record their solo albums. Susan's album was titled I Thought of You Again and Terry's titled Seasons in the Sun. Both albums were released in 1973 after Susan left the marriage. The title song on Susan's album earned her a Juno nomination for Canadian Female Vocalist of the Year while Terry was nominated as Male Vocalist of the Year for his album. Susan continued to have hits and other Juno nominations in Canada with songs including ""I Thought of You Again"", ""Forever"", ""Evergreen"", ""You Don't Know What Love Is"", ""I Want You To Love Me"", ""Build A Tower"", and ""Love Has No Pride"". With the release of her Dream album in 1975, Susan was nominated for her single ""Anna Marie"".In 1976, Jacks signed with Polydor Records. Her 1980 Ghosts album garnered her a Juno nomination with her single ""All The Tea in China"". In 1982 her Forever album was released. As a solo artist, she appeared regularly on tour as well as television shows including The Bobby Vinton Show, The Alan Thicke Show and numerous talk shows. She was also featured in a special called Caught in the Act and a Christmas special at Whistler Mountain.
In 1977, Susan met Canadian Football League player Ted Dushinski. They married in 1980 and had a son, Thad. The family moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 1983 where she recorded the Juno-nominated song, ""Another Woman's Man"". She was voted the best new country artist in Oklahoma for her song ""Tall Dark Stranger"". She became a staff songwriter for a Nashville publishing company and had several songs recorded, including a children's song on a Grammy nominated album entitled ""Snuggle Up"". Jacks later co-wrote and sang ""Looking For Love"" for the movie The Last Chance Cafe.In 2004, Jacks returned to Canada when her husband was diagnosed with lung cancer. He died on 24 October 2005. Upon returning, she was told she was in kidney failure and performed on a limited basis as her strength deteriorated. In 2010, Jacks received a kidney transplant donated by her brother Bill. A few months after the transplant, Jacks was again on stage and, on 17 April 2011, performed a benefit concert for the Kidney Foundation of Canada to raise awareness of the need for organ donation.
Jacks was inducted into the BC Entertainment Hall of Fame on 27 June 2010. Her album Dream, originally released in 1976, but abruptly removed from the market, was re-released in 2015. In 2016, Jacks was hospitalized with life-threatening complications from kidney failure. She recovered, and planned to return to the studio to record a new album in 2018.


== Death ==
Jacks died as a result of kidney disease–related infections at Surrey Memorial Hospital on 25 April 2022, at the age of 73. She was survived by a son, five brothers, a sister and two half-brothers.

Fossa (river),"Fossá is the name of several rivers in Iceland that are known for their waterfalls. The most well-known is Fossárdalur, which runs from Þingvellir towards the southern side of Hvalfjörður. This river is characterized by numerous waterfalls, with the most popular one located near Route 47, where car parking is available. 
There are other rivers in Iceland with the name Fossá, such as Fossá in Kjós and Fossá in Berufjörður, which are located in the Eastern Region (Austurland) near the fjord Berufjörður.
The term ""Fossá"" is derived from the Icelandic words ""foss"" meaning ""waterfall"" and ""á"" meaning ""river."" It is a common name for rivers in Iceland that feature waterfalls.

Sam Ainsley,"Sam Ainsley (born 1950) is a British artist and teacher, living and working in Glasgow, who was the founder and former head of the Master of Fine Art (MFA) programme at the Glasgow School of Art.


== Biography ==
Ainsley was born in North Shields, then Northumberland and now in North Tyneside. In 1973 she completed the one-year foundation course at the Jacob Kramer College in Leeds and until 1977 she studied painting at Newcastle Polytechnic. In 1975 she spent six weeks in Japan studying Sukiya architecture which led to her using a very limited palette of colours but with an emphasis on texture and materials. After graduating from Newcastle, Ainsley spent a year in postgraduate study at Edinburgh College of Art. When she completed her post-graduate diploma there in 1978, an Andrew Grant fellowship award allowed to her to teach part-time in the same department for a year.Following a visit to New York City in 1979, Ainsley began using unstretched, shaped canvases and her work developed from monochrome canvases into abstract shapes using the full colour spectrum Her Postgraduate work was heavily influenced by her time in Japan and her interest in Japanese culture  In 1982 Ainsley created a series of banners for the inauguration of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art's new building in Edinburgh. A commission for a thirty-foot tapestry woven at the Dovecot Studios, Edinburgh for the headquarters building of the General Accident insurance company in Perth was completed in 1983. Her 1985 Banner for Greenham represented Ainsley's political concerns and featured images of the circle of women protesting at Greenham Common. A solo show of Ainsley's work was held at the Third Eye Centre in Glasgow in 1987, a semi autobiographical installation entitled 'Why I Choose Red', her first major one person exhibition in Scotland. In 2004 she was also included in the permanent collection of women artists in the New Hall, Cambridge collection.From 1985 Ainsley taught at the Glasgow School of Art in Environmental Art before co-founding the School's MFA course in 1989 with fellow GSA lecturer John Calcutt. Ainsley was appointed as the MFA programme director in 1991 and held the post until 2005. Since leaving full-time teaching, Ainsley has continued to paint and participated in a number of joint and solo exhibitions.Ainsley is a respected and published spokeswoman for the visual arts and her own artwork is in a number of public and private collections nationally and internationally. Ainsley has contributed to a broad range of visual art initiatives in Scotland and has served as a board member on many arts organisations. She has exhibited in and curated independent exhibitions and undertaken residencies in numerous institutions and arts organisations across the USA, Australasia, Europe and the UK. More recent presentations of her work include the New Scots, RSA Edinburgh, Atlas of Encounters at I Space Gallery, Chicago and Athens, Live your Questions Now and Studio 58, Mackintosh Museum, GSA and After Growth and Form, Glasgow Print Studio. in 2017 she was invited to have a one person exhibition at An Tobar on the Isle of Mull. A full colour catalogue is available. Ainsley was also represented in two recent exhibitions in Edinburgh and Glasgow to mark the 30th anniversary of The Vigorous Imagination, a landmark exhibition held the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in 1987. She was also elected to the Royal Scottish Academy and was inducted into the 'Outstanding Women of Scotland' by the Saltire Society in 2017. She has worked collaboratively with David Harding and Sandy Moffat as AHM and continues to work independently in her studio.

"Independence Day (Azerbaijan, 28 May)","Independence Day (Azerbaijani: Müstəqillik Günü) honours the date on which the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (ADR) was founded as the first secular democratic state in the Muslim East: 28 May 1918. Since 1990, Republic Day is celebrated as a national holiday in Azerbaijan.Until 2021, it was marked as Republic Day. In October 2021, it was renamed and became Independence Day.


== History of Republic Day ==
The Russian Empire  was overthrown by the short-lived February Revolution in 1917. The national movement of people who were trampled by the tyranny existed in the country started. On 28 May 1918 the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (1918–1920), the first secular democratic state in the Muslim East was proclaimed. The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, founded by Mammad Amin Rasulzadeh, was the first parliamentary republic and the first democratic, legal and secular state in the Turkic and Islamic world.
Among the important accomplishments of the ADR was the extension of suffrage to women, making Azerbaijan one of the first countries in the world, and the very first majority-Muslim nation, to grant women equal political rights with men. The first state, which officially recognized the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was the Ottoman Empire. That historic event took place on 4 June 1918. On 9 November 1918 on the basis of the proposal by Mammad Amin Rasulzadeh the three-color flag of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was adopted.Until then the flag of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was red. The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was able to operate in a tense and complicated socio-political situation for only 23 months. The Soviet Union invaded Azerbaijan on 28 April 1920. Though the idea of independence was not defeated, and in 1991, after the collapse of the Soviet Empire, Azerbaijan again declared its independence.


=== Declaration of Independence ===
Azerbaijan declared independence from Russian Empire in Tiflis on 28 May 1918.The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was founded by the Azerbaijani National Council in Tiflis on 28 May 1918 after the collapse of the Russian Empire that began with the Russian Revolution of 1917. The Muslim representation in the defunct Transcaucasian Seim had constituted itself into the Azerbaijani National Council, and on 28 May 1918 proclaimed that a new nation was born. So far only a geographical reference, Azerbaijan now became the name of a state, and some 2 million people, called variously Tatars, Transcaucasian Muslims, and Caucasian Turks, officially became Azerbaijanis.


== Celebrations ==
One year after the founding of the ADR, a military parade on the site of the Azerbaijan Carpet Museum took place on Republic Day. The first jubilee celebrations in honor of the holiday took place in 1998. This events were widely celebrated in accordance with the decree “On the Celebration of the 80th Anniversary of the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan” that was signed by President Heydar Aliyev on 30 January 1998. On 26 May, President Aliyev delivered a speech to the National Assembly and a day later, he delivered a gala speech in honor of the occasion. In 2001, Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow visited the country for the first time to attend the Republic Day celebrations. In 2008, a postage stamp was issued in connection with the 90th anniversary of the Republic.


=== Locations ===
In honor of this day the station of the Baku underground is named. Initially, it was called ""April 28"", since on 28 April 1920, Soviet power was established in Azerbaijan, and the ADR ceased to exist. However, after the Republic gained independence for the second time, the name, reminiscent of the Soviet past, was replaced by ""May 28"". It was enough to rename only letters, the numbers remained the same.

Mosbach–Mudau Nos. 1 to 4,"The Mosbach–Mudau engines Nos. 1 to 4 (or Baden  C) were six-wheeled, narrow gauge, tank locomotives designed for the metre gauge line from Mosbach to Mudau.


== History ==
The four locomotives were built in 1904 by the firm of Borsig. The frame was designed as a water tank. Due to the steep inclines it had a large boiler, the boiler barrel consisting of two shells.
It had an Allan valve gear with trick valves. The connecting rods drove the third coupled wheels. The loco had an 
Exter counterweight brake for the engine and a Körting vacuum brake for the train. This was probably replaced in 1926 by a Westinghouse compressed-air brake. When the Deutsche Reichsbahn took over the operational running of the state-owned by privately operated line from the Deutsche Eisenbahn-Betriebsgesellschaft, a subsidiary of the firm of Vering & Waechter who had built the line, these engines were incorporated into their fleet as numbers 99 7201 to 99 7204. In 1964/1965 the steam locomotives were retired and replaced by diesel locomotives. Until then they had managed all the traffic, no other locomotives were even employed in a temporary role.


== Preserved ==
All the locomotives have been preserved until the present day.

99 7201 stood for a long time as a monument near Passau, before being acquired in 2007 by the Hirzbergbahn.
99 7202 is a monument at Mudau station.
99 7203 was used by the Albtalbahn from 1964 to 1966 for maintenance of way duties. It then went to the Karlsruhe gasworks and, later the Viernheim narrow gauge museum. Finally it ended up with the Ulmer Eisenbahnfreunde and has been in museum railway service since 1990 on the Amstetten–Oppingen line.
99 7204 (formerly No. 4) was bought from a timber factory in Oberbernbach and stored on an industrial site at Oberbernbach in Bavaria for a long time before being transferred in 1999 to the Märkische Museum Railway in Herscheid. In 2014 it was sold to a private individual in the Netherlands who planned to restore it.

Dirty Work (Rolling Stones album),"Dirty Work is the 18th British and 20th American studio album by the English rock band the Rolling Stones. It was released on 24 March 1986 on the Rolling Stones label by CBS Records, their first under their new contract with Columbia Records. Produced by Steve Lillywhite, the album was recorded during a period when relations between Mick Jagger and Keith Richards had soured considerably, according to Richards' autobiography Life.The album was recorded during a time of turmoil for the band, as its two principal songwriters, Richards and Jagger, had been feuding over the band's direction during most of the 1980s. Almost all of the band members had spent the previous few years working on solo albums or side projects. Some band members, including guitarist Ronnie Wood, drummer Charlie Watts and bassist Bill Wyman, were often absent from the studio during recording sessions; it was rare that all five principal members were together at the same time.  It would be the last album to feature former member and frequent piano contributor Ian Stewart, who died shortly before the album's release.  As a result, a number of guest musicians appeared on the album, including guitarists Jimmy Page and Bobby Womack. Keyboards were played by Ivan Neville and Chuck Leavell, who would remain with the band for decades. Unlike most Stones albums, there was no supporting tour, as the level of animosity among band members prevented them from being able to work together live onstage.
Dirty Work sold well, reaching platinum or gold status in several countries, including the United States, Canada and the UK, and peaking as a top-10-charting album in over a dozen markets. The album spawned two top-40 hits: a cover of Bob & Earl's song ""Harlem Shuffle"" and one of the songs written with Ronnie Wood, ""One Hit (To the Body)"". However, the album was a critical flop, with most critics then and now finding it uneven and uninspired, many reviewers citing the tensions within the band at the time.


== Recording ==
The sessions for Dirty Work, the first album under the Rolling Stones' recording contract with CBS Records, began in April 1985 in Boulogne Billancourt, running for two months before breaking for a short spell. Mick Jagger had just released his first solo album, She's the Boss (1985), much to Richards' annoyance, since Richards' first priority was the Rolling Stones and he was stung that Jagger was pursuing a career as a pop star. Jagger was absent from many of the Dirty Work sessions while Richards recorded instrumental parts with Ronnie Wood, Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts. As a result, Dirty Work is the first album since Beggars Banquet (1968) not to feature any guitar playing from Jagger, who instead recorded vocals at a later time. The divide between Jagger and Richards was on public view on 13 July 1985, when Jagger performed a solo set at Live Aid while Richards and Wood supported Bob Dylan's set on acoustic guitars.
Charlie Watts' involvement in the recording sessions was also limited; in 1994 Watts told Ed Bradley on 60 Minutes that during the 1980s he had been addicted to heroin and alcohol. Steve Jordan and Anton Fig play drums on some tracks; Ronnie Wood plays drums on ""Sleep Tonight"". Jagger would later cite Watts' personal state as one of the reasons he vetoed a tour in support of Dirty Work in 1986, preferring to start work on his second album, Primitive Cool (1987).
Four of the album's eight original compositions are credited to Jagger/Richards/Wood and one to Jagger/Richards/Chuck Leavell. Only three are credited to Jagger/Richards, the lowest number on any Rolling Stones album since Out of Our Heads (1965). Dirty Work is the first Rolling Stones album to feature two tracks with Richards on lead vocals (""Too Rude"" and ""Sleep Tonight"").
Following a further month of final recording in July and August 1985 (which saw guest appearances by Jimmy Page, Bobby Womack and Tom Waits), co-producer Steve Lillywhite supervised several weeks of mixing and the creation of 12-inch remixes. On 12 December, Ian Stewart, one of the Stones' founding members and their longtime pianist and road manager, died of a sudden heart attack at the age of 47. As a tribute, a hidden track of Stewart playing Big Bill Broonzy's ""Key to the Highway"" was added to close the album.


== Artwork and packaging ==
The original vinyl release of Dirty Work came shrinkwrapped in dark red cellophane. Breaking with Rolling Stones tradition, Dirty Work was the first of their studio albums to contain a lyric sheet in the United States, apparently at the insistence of then-distributor CBS Records. Also included was a comic strip, drawn by Mark Marek, called ""Dirty Workout"". 
In 2005, Pitchfork included the album cover in their list of ""The Worst Record Covers of All Time"", with Brent DiCrescenzo saying that no other cover ""goes so far to completely tarnish the reputation of a Valhalla-ensconced band while demonstrating the crushing awfulness of 1980s aesthetics"".


== Release and reception ==
In March 1986, the Rolling Stones' cover of ""Harlem Shuffle"" (the first lead single from a Stones studio album not to be a Jagger/Richards original since the band's earliest days) was released to a receptive audience, reaching No. 13 in the UK and No. 5 in the United States. The follow-up single ""One Hit (To the Body)"" was a US top-30 hit and featured a revealing video of Jagger and Richards seeming to trade blows (although Richards is syncing to Jimmy Page, who played lead guitar on the song).
Dirty Work was released a month after ""Harlem Shuffle"", reaching No. 4 in the UK and United States (going platinum there), but the critical reaction was less than enthusiastic. Some reviewers felt the album was slight in places, with weak, generic songwriting from Richards and Wood and puzzlingly abrasive vocals from Jagger. Some felt Jagger was saving his best material for his solo records, though the critical reaction to those releases was muted as well. People named it one of the worst albums of 1986, denoting ""The worst fears of the Baby Boomers come true: If the Stones are sounding this old and tired, what does it say about their original fans?""However, at the same time, Robert Christgau called Dirty Work ""a bracing and even challenging record [which] innovates without kowtowing to multi-platinum fashion or half-assed pretension. It's honest and makes you like it."" In 2004, Stylus Magazine's ""On Second Thoughts"" feature assessed the album as ""a tattered, embarrassed triumph, by far the most interesting Stones album since Some Girls at every level: lyrical, conceptual, instrumental"" and claiming that the album features ""the most venomous guitar sound of the Stones' career, and Jagger's most committed vocals.""Richards said that songs on the album were structured to be played live with a view to tour in support of the album, before Jagger decided he was not going to tour after all, though Jagger later cited his concerns about Watts's health for not doing so. The only songs from Dirty Work to be played live have been ""One Hit (To the Body)"" and ""Harlem Shuffle"", both performed on the Steel Wheels tour.In 1994 Dirty Work was remastered and reissued by Virgin Records, and again in 2009 by Universal Music. It was released on SHM-SACD in 2011 by Universal Music Japan.

Naai Sekar,"Naai Sekar (transl. Dog Sekar) is a 2022 Indian Tamil-language science fantasy comedy film written and directed by debutant Kishore Rajkumar and produced by AGS Entertainment. The film stars Sathish and Pavithra Lakshmi (in her debut) with a supporting cast including George Maryan, Ganesh, Livingston, Ilavarasu and Sriman. It revolves around the story of a man who has his soul swapped with a Labrador Retriever. The film soundtrack featured three songs with a song composed by Anirudh Ravichander. Naai Sekar was released on 13 January 2022.


== Plot ==
Sekar is an IT employee who does not like his job much. His neighbour Rajarajan is a scientist who is hellbent on proving that it is possible to alter the DNA of humans and animals, thereby making humans have characteristics of animals. While the result of his experiment goes unexpected, one day a dog named Padayappa bites Sekar and that ends up in their characteristics getting swapped. The rest of the movie is about what happens next and how the two get back to their original selves.


== Cast ==


== Production ==

The production company AGS Entertainment announced a new project with Sathish (in his debut lead role) and announced the title as Naai Sekar in September 2021. Pavithra Lakshmi who contested earlier in Cooku with Comali TV show, was cast in the film as the female lead. The voice over for the dog was given by Shiva.


=== Title controversy ===
Actor Vadivelu also planned his next film title as Naai Sekar with director Suraj which was bankrolled by Lyca Productions and the film was a spin-off of his character 'Naai Sekar' in the Thalai Nagaram (2006). But the title was already registered by AGS Entertainment. After a lot of discussions, AGS Entertainment still kept the film as Naai Sekar. So the makers of Vadivelu's film had to go for an alteration in the title and finalised Naai Sekar Returns as their new title.


== Music ==
The soundtrack featured three songs with 'Edakku Modakku' song composed and sung by Anirudh Ravichander. The lyric was written by Sivakarthikeyan and choreography was done by Sandy for 'Edakku Modakku' song.

The islet is a remnant piece of cliff line which rises to a height of 11 metres (36 feet) and sits on an intertidal rock platform that joins the mainland at the west and extends past the island to the east.  The islet is named due to the similarity of its shape to a conical Asian hat.  Access is reported as being ‘best gained by small boat, taking care to avoid the shallow rocks and reefs in the surrounding waters.’  
The name ‘Chinamans Hat’ is also informally used for other features near the islet such as the small bay located between it and the mainland, the intertidal reef that connects it to the mainland and facilities on the mainland provided as part of the Innes National Park.

Lehrte,"Lehrte is a town in the district of Hanover, in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is situated approximately 17 km east of Hanover. In the 19th century Lehrte was the most important railway junction in the former Kingdom of Hanover. As of the 21st century, it has a population of 43,000.


== History ==
The first documented history of the area was in 1147 and shows that, what is now known as Lehrte, was a relatively small farming village. Up to the year 1352, when the church, now known as Nikolauskirche, was built; the local farming residents attended Sunday church services in the village of Steinwedel.
At this time, Lehrte lay in the historical region known as the Großen Freien which literally translates to the big free and lay far from major transit and traffic routes.


== Economy ==
Lehrte lay fairly dormant until 1843, when work began on the Hanover–Brunswick railway, linking Lehrte with both towns. In the following year, work began on building lines to Celle (1845), Hildesheim (1846) and Berlin (1871).
When work on the railway line commenced, Lehrte had 755 inhabitants; 60 years later the population had increased approximately ten times. In 1898 the area of Lehrte was granted municipal rights and formally recognised as a town.
With the railway well and truly established, industry grew within Lehrte, including clay works, a mineral fertilizer works, a cement factory, canned goods and a sugar factory in 1883 which, until 2002, dominated the centre of the town. The cement factory was created in 1881 by Hermann Manske with other limited partners and was the second factory of the cement industry in the Hanover region.
In 1910 the cement factory was shut down. In 1911 a cattle market was established and Lehrte became one of the most important places for cattle trade and shipment in Northern Germany. In 1912, mining began on the potash reserves in the area. The Lehrter Bahnhof (Lehrte Station) in Berlin is named after Lehrte. It was opened in 1871 as the terminus of the line linking Berlin with Lehrte and Hannover, which later became Germany's most important east–west main line.Since the 1920s, a large substation has existed in Ahlten, which in 1944 was the end of the experimental Lehrte-Misburg HVDC line.

== Political life ==
Simon Mackay was the unsuccessful Liberal candidate for Galloway in 1959, and by the late 1960s was joint Treasurer of the Scottish Liberal Party. He was created a life peer on 21 May 1971 as Baron Tanlaw, of Tanlawhill in the County of Dumfries.Lord Tanlaw sat in the House of Lords as a Conservative after many years as a crossbencher. He attended the chamber and voted regularly, and took a particular interest in debates concerning energy conservation, global warming and the environment. He retired from the House on 3 November 2017.


=== Lighter Evenings Bill ===
A keen amateur horologist, Lord Tanlaw is a Fellow of both the Royal Astronomical Society and the British Horological Institute. In 2005, he introduced the Lighter Evenings (Experiment) Bill, which would move the United Kingdom's time zone forward by one hour, to UTC+1 in the winter and UTC+2 in the summer, for a trial period of three years. Lord Tanlaw claims that this would reduce accidents in the winter as the evenings would be lighter, and has the backing of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. Opponents fear that it would have an adverse effect on people living in Scotland and northern England, where the mornings would be much darker. A similar experiment, known as British Standard Time, was trialled between 1968 and 1971 before being abandoned. The bill had its second reading in the House of Lords on 24 March 2006. The government had already rejected the proposal the previous year.Lord Tanlaw persists in pressing his case for a change of time zone. Most of his last appearances in the House of Lords was to argue for lighter evenings, which he did when there was only the most tenuous link to the topic being debated in the chamber. Such did his reputation become that other Lords were able to predict when the issue was to be raised by Lord Tanlaw's appearance in his usual seat on the cross-benches.

Aliens: Thanatos Encounter,"Aliens: Thanatos Encounter is a 2001 shooter video game developed by Crawfish Interactive and based on the Alien science-fiction horror film series. It was published by THQ and released for the Game Boy Color handheld game console. The game takes place aboard Thanatos, an abandoned freighter that has been infested with Alien creatures.


== Gameplay ==
Aliens: Thanatos Encounter is a single-player shooter based on the Alien science-fiction horror film series. It takes place aboard Thanatos, an abandoned freighter that has been infested with Alien creatures. The game is played from a top-down perspective and features 12 levels, each available in three difficulty settings. In each level, the player must clear areas of Alien creatures and rescue survivors to progress. There are five Colonial Marines characters for the player to choose from and each has different skills and attributes. If the player's current marine is defeated by an Alien creature, the player must replay the level with another marine and has a time limit to rescue the previous one.The player can use most of the weapons that were introduced in the films, including pulse rifles, flamethrowers, and grenade launchers. Some marines can use a motion tracker to detect enemies, while others can use two-handed weapons. The game offers three firing modes: the first one allows the player to shoot in the direction the marine moves, the second one allows the player to shoot enemies while moving backwards, and the third one allows the player to shoot in any direction from a pixed position.


== Development and release ==
Thanatos Encounter was developed by the Australian company Wicked Witch Software after the British company Crawfish Interactive offered them an opportunity to create a game based on the Alien license. Because the developers were fans of the Alien films, they decided to include all the weapons that appeared in the films regardless of the extra development costs. The game's size is 8 Megabits. It was published by THQ and released for the Game Boy Color handheld game console on March 21, 2001.


== Reception ==

Thanatos Encounter received mixed reviews from English and French publications. Nintendo Power noted that rescuing marines under a time limit intensifies the gameplay, but remarked that the top-down perspective ruins the suspense. Pocket Magazine felt that the game's graphics, while sharp, lack colourful details and said that the music does not offer tension. However, the magazine highlighted the enjoyable gameplay and the fact that enemies have different behaviours. In contrast, N64 Magazine criticized their artificial intelligence, saying that ""the aliens just scamper about, bumping into walls"", and explained that their unpredictable behavior, combined with their fast movement speed, makes the game highly frustrating. Consoles + did not recommend the game and criticized its slow gameplay, while Jeuxvideo.com praised the originality of the game's three firing modes, stating that they make the gameplay not repetitive.

Ruhr (river),"The Ruhr is a river in western Germany (North Rhine-Westphalia), a right tributary (east-side) of the Rhine.


== Description and history ==
The source of the Ruhr is near the town of Winterberg in the mountainous Sauerland region, at an elevation of approximately 670 metres (2,200 ft). It flows into the lower Rhine at an elevation of only 17 metres (56 ft) in the municipal area of Duisburg. Its total length is 219 km (136 mi), its average discharge is 79 cubic metres per second (2,800 cu ft/s) at Mülheim near its mouth. Thus, its discharge is, for example, comparable to that of the river Ems in Northern Germany or the River Thames in the United Kingdom.
The Ruhr first passes the towns of Meschede, Arnsberg, Wickede, Fröndenberg, Holzwickede, Iserlohn, and Schwerte. Then the river marks the southern limit of the Ruhr area, passing Hagen, Dortmund, Herdecke, Wetter, Witten, Bochum, Hattingen, Essen, Mülheim, and Duisburg.
The Ruhr area was Germany's primary industrial area during the early- to mid-20th century. Most factories were located there. The occupation of the Ruhr from 1923-24 by French forces, due to the Weimar Republic's failure to continue paying reparations from World War I, provoked passive resistance, which saw production in the factories grind to a halt. As a result, the German hyperinflation crisis grew even worse.
During World War II, two of the dams on the Ruhr, the Möhne Dam and the Sorpe Dam were targets for Operation Chastise, in which special ""bouncing bombs"" were developed to take out the dams and flood the valley, with the hope of seriously affecting the German industries there. The story was told in a 1951 book and the popular 1955 film made from it, The Dam Busters.


== Lakes ==
There are five Ruhr reservoirs on the river, often used for leisure activities.

Hengsteysee between Dortmund and Hagen, surface area: 1.36 km² height of the weir 4.5m
Harkortsee between Herdecke and Wetter; surface area: 1.37 km², height of the weir 7.8m
Kemnader See between Witten and Bochum; surface area: 1.25 km², height of the weir 2m
Baldeneysee in Essen-Werden; surface area: 2.64 km², height of the weir 8.5m
Kettwiger See in Essen-Kettwig; surface area: 0.55 km², height of the weir 6m


== Tributaries ==
The main tributaries of the Ruhr are (from source to mouth):

Left: Berkelbach, Voßmecke, Neger, Elpe, Valme, Nierbach, Henne, Kelbke, Wenne, Mühlenbach, Röhr, Bachumer Bach, Haßbach, Scheebach, Wimberbach, Hönne, Abbabach, Baarbach, Elsebach, Wannebach (Ergste), Lenne, Volme, Sprockhöveler Bach, Deilbach, Oefter Bach, RinderbachRight: Hillebach, Gierskoppbach, Gebke (Meschede), Kleine Gebke, Gebke (Wennemen), Wanne, Möhne, Wannebach (Westhofen), Borbach, Wannenbach, Hörsterholzer Bach, Knöselsbach, Rumbach

The Six Shooter,"The Six Shooter is a United States Western old-time radio program starring James Stewart as a gunfighter. It was created by Frank Burt, who also wrote many of the episodes, and lasted only one season of 39 episodes on NBC (Sept. 20, 1953–June 24, 1954). Initially, it was broadcast on Sundays at 9:30 pm Eastern Time, through October 11. Then it was heard at 8:30 pm for three weeks. Finally, on November 8, 1953, through March 21, 1954, it was broadcast Sundays at 8 pm; beginning April 1, 1954, through the final episode, it was on Thursdays at 8:30 pm.   One old-time radio directory called the program ""a last, desperate effort by a radio network (NBC) to maintain interest in adventure drama by employing a major Hollywood movie star in the leading role.""Stewart starred as Britt Ponset, a drifting cowboy in the final years of the wild west. Episodes ranged from straight Western drama to whimsical comedy. A trademark of the show was Stewart's use of whispered narration during tense scenes that created a heightened sense of drama, and relief when the situation was resolved.Some of the more prominent actors to perform on the program included Parley Baer, Virginia Gregg, Harry Bartell, Howard McNear, Jeanette Nolan, Dan O'Herlihy, Alan Reed, Marvin Miller, and William Conrad (often credited as ""Julius Krelboyne"" because he was also the star of CBS's radio show Gunsmoke, playing Marshall Matt Dillon at the time). Some did multiple episodes playing different characters.
Each episode opened with the announcer (Hal Gibney; John Wald in later episodes) stating: ""The man in the saddle is angular and long-legged. His skin is sun-dyed brown. The gun in his holster is gray steel and rainbow mother-of-pearl, its handle unmarked. People call them both 'the Six Shooter'.""The haunting theme music was ""Highland Lament"", arranged by series composer Basil Adlam and written by British film composer Charles Williams. Jack Johnstone was the producer-director for NBC Radio, in association with Revue Productions.
The final episode, ""Myra Barker"", provided a satisfying (if melancholy) finale to the series. Ponset falls in love with Myra, and proposes marriage. Myra, after thinking it over, appears to accept, but then tells Britt she has heard that Sheriff Jennings of Eagle Falls has asked for his help, and Britt admits that he feels obligated to go. Myra tells Britt to go and not come back, telling him some adventure will always call him, and he will always go, or regret not going. Britt goes, resuming his wanderings, but not before revealing to the audience that he knows he was *not* needed in Eagle Falls, and knows Myra knows that, too. The moment comes across as a moment of supreme self-realization by Britt that he always will be a wanderer.


== Episodes ==


== Adaptation ==
James Stewart filmed a television pilot episode titled The Windmill featuring Barbara Hale, John McIntire, and Edgar Buchanan, but it somehow failed to sell. A perfect copy of the episode exists, however. The program was later successfully adapted for television in 1957 with John Payne as the star; by that time, Stewart's career had completely recovered from his initial postwar slump, and he was no longer available. An article in a trade publication reported that 39 ""half-hour tv films"" would be produced ""for a series titled The Six Shooter."" Frank Burt was the consultant for all episodes of the adaptation. The pilot episode, titled ""The Restless Gun"", aired on 29 March 1957 as an episode of the anthology series Schlitz Playhouse of Stars. John Payne, who went on to star in the series, played the lead character, Britt Ponsett.  By the time the series, also called The Restless Gun, debuted the following fall, though, the main character's name had been changed to Vint Bonner, ""a slightly altered rendition of Britt Ponset"".


== Trivia ==
An episode of the anthology Hollywood Star Playhouse on NBC entitled ""The Six Shooter"", was broadcast April 13, 1952. This used the ""Ben Scofield"" script, which was also used for the audition episode and (with a slightly different opening) the seventh episode of the series.
The unaired audition episode, recorded July 15, 1953, includes a personal message by James Stewart in the middle and end trying to sell the program to potential sponsors.
Stewart revived the Ponset character for the Feb. 10, 1957, episode of the television anthology program General Electric Theater titled ""The Town with a Past"". The script was based on the ""Silver Annie"" episode of the radio show. Stewart, however, declined to appear on a weekly TV version, and the proposed series was offered to John Payne.
The Dec. 15, 1957, episode of G.E. Theater, ""The Trail to Christmas"", was based on the radio episode ""Britt Ponset's Christmas Carol"", although in this instance, Stewart's character was renamed Bart, and the Dec. 15, 1959, episode of the television anthology program Startime, ""Cindy's Fella"", was based on the radio episode ""When the Shoe Doesn't Fit"". Stewart took the role of peddler Azel Dorsey, while George Gobel played an unnamed drifter in place of Ponset.
Ponset's horse was named Scar.
Although Liggett & Myers Tobacco Co. was interested in underwriting the program, James Stewart refused to accept, believing that it did not coincide with his public image. Jack Johnstone was quoted as saying, ""Chesterfield begged and begged and begged for months trying to get sponsorship, but Jim didn’t feel that, because of his screen image, it would be fair for him to be sponsored by a cigarette"". Coleman eventually bought commercial time during the first four episodes, but no other advertisers sustained the series after that.

Anya's Ghost,"Anya's Ghost is a coming-of-age ghost story in graphic novel format.  The first book by cartoonist Vera Brosgol, Anya's Ghost was published on June 7, 2011.
In the novel, unpopular Anya befriends the ghost of Emily, a girl around Anya's age who died 90 years earlier.  After failing to make Anya popular and happy, Emily becomes manipulative and controlling, leading Anya to discover the truth about Emily's death.
Anya's Ghost took four years from inception to publication, and is drawn predominantly in hues of violet.  Well received by critics, Anya's Ghost is the recipient of Cyblis, Harvey, and Eisner awards.  Production on a film adaptation of the novel was supposed to begin by the end of 2017.


== Plot ==
Annushka Borzakovskaya (Anya) is a Russian émigré living in the United States with her mother and brother (Sasha).  Unpopular at her New England private school, Anya skips school and walks through a nearby forest.  She falls into a dry well and finds herself alongside a human skeleton.  The skeleton's ghost—a shy, homely girl named Emily—appears and explains that she too fell down the well and died of dehydration after breaking her neck ninety years ago.  Emily wishes to befriend and help Anya, but cannot move far from her bones.  Anya is soon rescued by a passerby, but Emily's skeleton remains undiscovered.
Emily later appears to Anya at school, Anya having inadvertently taken a finger bone from Emily's skeleton.  Anya decides to keep the bone after Emily helps her cheat on a biology exam and spy on her crush, Sean.  Emily gives her full name as Emily Reilly and explains that her fiancé died fighting in World War I, and that her parents were murdered at home.  She was running from the killer when she fell down the well.  Anya promises to find Emily's killer, while Emily agrees to help Anya fit in at school and win over Sean.  As their friendship develops, Anya drifts away from her one friend at school, Siobhan, while Emily becomes disinterested in discovering her murderer's identity.
At Emily's insistence, Anya dresses up and goes to a party attended by Sean and his girlfriend Elizabeth.  There, Anya discovers that Sean habitually cheats on Elizabeth with her knowledge.  Distraught, Anya leaves the party, which makes Emily angry and confused as she believed Anya and Sean were destined for each other.  Anya later notices Emily becoming more controlling and adjusting her appearance by straightening her hair and smoking ghostly cigarettes.  Anya goes to the library without Emily to research the killer; there she learns that Emily had no fiancé, but had instead murdered a young couple in their home after her unrequited love rejected her, and then died running from the authorities.
When Anya returns home, the finger bone is missing.  After being confronted with the truth, Emily shows that she is capable of moving solid objects, implying that she put her finger bone in Anya's bag.  Emily begins threatening Anya's family to make Anya comply, even causing Anya's mother to fall down the stairs.  After Emily appears before Sasha, he reveals that he found the bone earlier.  Anya retrieves it and runs to the well, pursued by Emily.
Once there, Anya confronts and accuses Emily of trying to live vicariously through her.  Emily rebukes Anya, saying that she is no better, and that the two of them are more alike than she wants to admit.  After Emily fails to push Anya into the well, Anya drops the bone back in.  Emily then possesses her own skeleton and climbs out to give further chase.  Anya stops and convinces Emily of the futility of her situation, causing the tearful ghost to dissipate, and the skeleton to fall back into the well.  Later, Anya convinces her school to fill the well and rekindles her friendship with Siobhan.


== Development ==


=== Writing ===
Brosgol conceived the character of Anya when she was working on Put the Book Back on the Shelf (2006), a comics anthology based on the music of the Scottish indie pop band Belle and Sebastian.  She wrote a short story about a disaffected schoolgirl to accompany the song ""Family Tree"" (from the band's 2000 album Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant).  Brosgol didn't finish the story, but enjoyed drawing ""that character with her fat little legs and cigarettes.""  Then, after reading Haruki Murakami's novel The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, she decided her unnamed character should fall down a well.  The rest of the story came later, drawn from the author's own life and other inspiration.  Brosgol started work on Anya's Ghost in 2007.


=== Production ===
As Anya's Ghost was her first book, Brosgol said that its production was an exercise in trial and error.  Brosgol does not work from a script, saying that ""the art and the dialogue come at the same time and one suggests the other"".  She prefers to illustrate events rather than use dialogue in her comics.  Working from a detailed outline, Brosgol drew thumbnails of each panel—two to a page in a Moleskine notebook—and wrote the dialogue as she went along.From her thumbnails, Brosgol used her Wacom Cintiq to draw a rough version of the ultimate art.  This rough version of Anya's Ghost went to her editor for approval.  After approval, Brosgol went back through her rough draft and ""tightened the roughs up just enough so that [she] could ink them"".  She then used paintbrushes (being especially particular about her Winsor & Newton Series 7s) to paint on Canson translucent vellum atop her printed-out rough draft.  Brosgol inked the panels and speech balloons first, adding in the lettering digitally later with a custom font developed for her by John Martz; she colored the novel in Adobe Photoshop.Anya's Ghost is drawn in what Pamela Paul called a ""deep violet palette"" that Brosgol called ""purpley-blue"".  The artist herself said she chose the colors ""for no other reason than I like purpley-blue and I think it feels right for the story"".  Susan Carpenter of the Los Angeles Times interpreted the colors as ""a subtle underscoring of Anya's bruised ego"".


=== Publication ===
Having worked on Kazu Kibuishi's Flight comics, Brosgol contacted his talent agent Judith Hansen who had agreed to look at the work of anybody involved.  After completing the art for Anya's Ghost in 2009, Brosgol brought it to Hansen, who agreed to represent the artist.  Brosgol finished the cover art in 2010, and then ""there's a full year on the end for printing, and marketing, and all of that which comes with a book publisher.""  The book was published on June 7, 2011 by First Second Books.


== Reception ==
Anya's Ghost won the 2011 Cybils literary award in the Young Adult category.  It also won the 2012 Harvey Award for ""Best Original Graphic Publication for Younger Readers"" and the 2012 Eisner Award for ""Best Publication for Young Adults (Ages 12–17)"".  Anya's Ghost was nominated for the 2011 Bram Stoker Award for Best Graphic Novel, but lost to Neonomicon by Alan Moore.The Los Angeles Times' Susan Carpenter reviewed the graphic novel and described it as ""a well-paced story that feels dynamic and also intimate.""  She further lauded the work, calling it ""humorous"" and ""beautifully drawn"".  Pamela Paul of The New York Times compared Anya's Ghost positively to Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis, saying that the novel felt real (even with its supernatural elements) and that Anya was ""a smart, funny and compassionate portrait of someone who, for all her sulking and sneering, is the kind of daughter many parents would like to have.""  Wired's Kathy Ceceri also noted an artistic similarity to Persepolis; she not only liked how Anya's Ghost intertwined the teenage angst and fantasy elements of the novel, but praised how Anya's desire for a boyfriend doesn't overwhelm the story.  Cory Doctorow reviewed Anya's Ghost for Boing Boing, calling it ""really sweet, really funny and really scary, [with] a powerful message about identity, fitting in, and the secret selfish bastard lurking in all of us and whether having such a goblin inside makes us irredeemable or merely human.""  Whitney Matheson with USA Today wrote that Anya's Ghost is a ""funny, creepy and a delightful page-turner"" and cited author Neil Gaiman who called the novel ""a masterpiece"".  Steve Duin of The Oregonian praised the inventiveness of Brosgol's storytelling, and called her art ""[a] little uneven, but ... at its best when the lights go out.""  Almost six years after its publication, Paste listed Anya's Ghost as a comic having ""the potential to mean something special, to offer something valuable and important, whether that’s revelatory depth or escapist fun, to a young reader.""


== Film adaptation ==
Andy and Barbara Muschietti, director and producer of the 2013 horror film Mama, bought the film rights to Anya's Ghost in 2015.  That October, they were speaking with scriptwriter Patrick Ness for a screenplay, and in August 2017, Deadline Hollywood announced that, with a script by Ness, production of the Anya's Ghost film would ""begin before year’s end.""  Dan Mazer would direct, Jeremy Bolt and Benedict Carver would produce, and Entertainment One was financing the film.  Bolt described Ness as ""passionate about the source material"", having written a ""fresh and distinctive"" screenplay; Bolt went on to describe the film as a ""classic high school comedy with a supernatural twist.""  According to Deadline Hollywood, Emma Roberts had been cast to star in the film.

=== First bridge ===
The first bridge at this location was built by the Port Orange Bridge Company (owned by S. H. Gove) in 1906, made of sable palm pilings and pine bridge timbers. In 1918, Gove offered to sell the bridge to Volusia County. The bridge was severely damaged by a hurricane in 1932, and was torn down. Port Orange was without a bridge for many years after the disaster.

A bascule bridge was finally built here as a replacement in 1951. The two-lane drawbridge was paid for with tolls. The bridge connected the two ends of Dunlawton Avenue, from the mainland to the beach peninsula.


=== Third bridge ===
In May 1987, the U.S. federal government agreed to provide $8.16 million of the estimated $12 million cost of building a Port Orange, Florida bridge planned to be similar to the Granada Bridge. After the drawbridge had aged and was expensive to maintain, it was replaced in 1990 by a new four-lane high bridge, which carries State Road A1A over the river. The Florida State Legislature designated the new bridge as the Congressman William V. Chappel Jr. Memorial Bridge.

Port of Halifax,"The Port of Halifax comprises various port facilities in Halifax Harbour in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. It covers 10 km2 (3.9 sq mi) of land, and looks after 150 km2 (58 sq mi) of water.Strategically located as North America's first inbound and last outbound gateway, the port of Halifax is a naturally deep, wide, ice-free harbour with minimal tides and is two days closer to Europe and one day closer to Southeast Asia (via the Suez Canal) than any other North American East Coast port. In addition, it is one of just a few eastern seaboard ports able to accommodate and service fully laden post-Panamax container ships using the latest technology.
With 17 of the world's top shipping lines calling the port, including transshipment, feeder ship services and direct access to Canadian National Railway (CN) inland network, the port of Halifax is connected virtually to every market in North America and over 150 countries worldwide supporting the delivery of all types of cargoes. Annually the port handles over 1,500 vessels, generates 15,000 jobs and $2 billion in economic impact. Halifax is one of Canada's top four container ports in terms of the volume of cargo handled.


== History ==
After the Royal Navy withdrew from Halifax in 1905, the dockyards were handed over to the Government of Canada. Prior to World War I, the government began the Ocean Terminals project. A new railway was built through the city's South End to service the modern piers, the first of which opened in the early 1920s. Shipping grew sharply during World War II.With the containerisation revolution of shipping, it was decided to build a container terminal in Halifax. The South End Container Terminal opened in the South End in 1969 at the site of the former Seaward Defence Base.A specialised vehicular processing facility, the Autoport, was opened in 1971. It provides various pre-distribution services in addition to basic loading and off-loading. The number of vehicles handled annually by the Autoport has grown from 100,000 in 1979 to about 250,000 today.By the late 1970s the South End Container Terminal was operating at capacity, handling more tonnage than any other container terminal in Canada. A second container terminal at Fairview Cove was therefore built at a cost of $47 million and opened in 1982. It was originally a single-berth facility, and operations were contracted out to Cerescorp Inc. The terminal has since been expanded. In 2003, Ceres (now a subsidiary of Nippon Yusen) successfully bid on a continued operations contract, effective January 1, 2003 for 20 years.In 2005 the Fairview Cove Container Terminal berth depth was deepened to 16.8 metres (55 ft) (as deep as the New Panama Canal).
In 2012 a major expansion of the South End Container Terminal was completed. The depth of the berth was increased from 14.5 to 16 metres (48 to 52 ft) and the pier was extended.In June 2017 it welcomed its first Neopanamax vessel, the ZIM Antwerp.On August 1, 2019, PSA International completed its acquisition the former Halterm south end container terminal from Macquarie GroupIn 2021, 16,020-TEU CMA CGM Explorer-class container ships made their inaugural visits to the PSA south-end terminal.


== Administration ==
Many major port facilities are owned by the Halifax Port Authority (HPA), a port authority operating as a federally regulated Crown corporation of the Government of Canada. HPA has responsibility of managing 260 acres federally owned marine industrial land in Halifax Harbour.
The HPA was created on March 1, 1999 and succeeds the Halifax Port Corporation (HPC). HPC was the successor to the National Harbours Board, which operated all federally owned ports in Canada. Halifax was one of the first of eighteen national ports in Canada which implemented this administrative change as required by the Canada Marine Act which passed on June 11, 1998.


== Facilities ==
Halifax Port Authority facilities include:

South End Container Terminal – Piers 36–42 (operated by PSA Halifax)
Ocean Terminals – Piers 23–34
Halifax Seaport (formerly the Seawall) – Piers 20–22, Cruise Ship Pavilion and Pier 21 museum, NSCAD University, HPA administrative building
Halifax Grain Elevator (leased and operated by Halifax Grain Elevator Limited)
Richmond Terminals – Piers 9 and 9A
Richmond Offshore Terminals – Piers 9B–9D (multi-user supply base for offshore oil and gas exploration/production)
Fairview Cove Container Terminal – (currently operated by Cerescorp)
Sheet Harbour Industrial PortMajor port facilities not owned or administered by HPA:

National Gypsum Wharf – (owned and operated by National Gypsum Company to serve Wrights Cove gypsum terminal)
Woodside Atlantic Wharf – (vessel lay-up and repair, servicing oil rigs)
Imperial Oil Wharves – (Imperial Oil, serves the Dartmouth Refinery)
Autoport – (owned by Canadian National)All HPA facilities except the Sheet Harbour Port are serviced by Canadian National.


== Cruise ships ==
In addition to being one of the world's largest natural harbours for breakbulk, bulk, roll-on/roll-off, containerized and project cargoes, the Halifax seaport has become an increasingly popular port of call for cruise ships from around the world. In 2019, the Port of Halifax had 179 cruise vessel calls with over 323,000 passengers aboard. It is estimated that cruise passengers alone contribute about $172 million to Halifax's economy every year.

Sun Kwok,"Sun Kwok (Chinese: 郭新, born September 15, 1949) is a Hong Kong astronomer best known for his work on physics and chemistry of the late stages of stellar evolution.  In 1978, he proposed a new theory on the origin of planetary nebulae. which has transformed our understanding of the death of Sun-like stars.  He is a pioneer on the study of stellar synthesis of organic compounds, which may have implications on the origin of life on Earth.


== Background ==
Born in Hong Kong, Sun Kwok graduated from Pui Ching Middle School, the same school attended by Daniel Chee Tsui, Nobel Prize Winner in Physics and Shing-Tung Yau, Fields Medal Winner.

Chair Professor of Space Science and Director of Laboratory for Space Research, University of Hong Kong (2016-2018)
Chair Professor of Physics and Dean of Science, University of Hong Kong (2006-2016)
President, International Astronomical Union (IAU) Commission F3: Astrobiology (2015-2018)
Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (2012-)
Distinguished Research Fellow and Director, Institute of Astronomy & Astrophysics, Academia Sinica, Taiwan (2003–2006)
Professor, University of Calgary (1983–2005)
President, IAI Commission 34: Interstellar Matter (2012-2015)

Chairman, IAU Working Group on Planetary Nebulae (Division VI) (1994–2001)
Principal Investigator (Astronomy), Canadian participation in the Odin mission


== Research ==
In addition to his work on planetary nebulae, Kwok was also recognized for his discovery of proto-planetary nebulae, the missing link in our understanding of the late stages of stellar evolution, and the discovery of the unidentified emission feature at 21 micrometres which is believed to be an unusual carbonaceous compound . Using space-based infrared telescopes, he has found that organic compounds with aromatic and aliphatic structures can be synthesized rapidly in the late stages of stellar evolution. These star-manufactured compounds are now known to have spread widely throughout the Galaxy, and are believed to have played a role in the chemical enrichment of the early solar system.His book Stardust: Cosmic Seeds of Life (Springer 2013) was selected by Choice Magazine as an ""Outstanding Academic Title"" for 2014.


== Education reform ==
As Dean of Science at the University of Hong Kong, Kwok introduced a number of education reforms, including the major/minor system in 2006, Faculty-wide common admission in 2007, experiential learning in 2007, and science foundation courses in 2012. He developed and taught a common core course ""Our Place in the Universe"" which highlights the influence of astronomical development on philosophy, religion, and society.

Capitol Heights–Minnesota Avenue Line,"The Capitol Heights–Minnesota Avenue Line, designated Route V2, V4, is a daily bus route operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority between Capitol Heights station of the Blue and Silver Lines of the Washington Metro and Anacostia station (V2) or Navy Yard–Ballpark station (V4) of the Green Line of the Washington Metro. The line runs every 12 minutes daily and 30 minutes at all other times. Trips take roughly 45-50 minutes.


== Background ==
Routes V2 and V4 provide service between Capitol Heights station and Anacostia station or Navy Yard–Ballpark station. These routes connect Northeast residents to Southeast from Benning Heights. Routes V2 and V4 operate out of Southern Avenue division on weekdays, Andrews Federal Center on select trips, and Shepherd Parkway on weekends.


== History ==
Routes V2 originally operated by the Washington Railway & Electric Company under the Capitol Heights–Anacostia Line running between Capitol Heights and Anacostia. Route V4 also operated under the Washington Railway & Electric Company under the Capitol Heights-Navy Yard Line between Capitol Heights and Navy Yard. Both lines would later be acquired by Capital Traction Company and were converted into buses on May 1, 1949. Both lines were later acquired by WMATA on February 4, 1973.V2 had a prior incarnation as the 4th Street Line under the Washington Railway & Electric Company but was later replaced by the M2. V4 also had a prior incarnation as the S. Washington-Ridge Rd. under the Capital Traction Company but was later consolidated.V6 was discontinued and replaced by the V4 on January 22, 1984.Route V4 originally operated until the 1990s when they were replaced by the Minnesota Ave-M St Line on December 28, 1991.


=== Route U2 ===
Route U2 originally operated as the Benning-Kenilworth Line under the Washington Railway & Electric Company before being renamed into the V8.Route U2 originally operated into Maryland but was discontinued on December 3, 1978 and replaced by routes F14 and P12. Route U2 would operate as the Deanwood–Minnesota Avenue Line between the Deanwood station & Benning Heights (Hanna Place SE & Benning Road SE), via the Minnesota Avenue Metro Station, and then via Minnesota Avenue NE, Eastern Avenue NE, Kenilworth Avenue NE, Deane Avenue NE, Minnesota Avenue NE/SE, Ridge Road SE, Anacostia Road SE, B Street SE, Texas Avenue SE, E Street SE, Alabama Avenue SE, H Street SE, Benning Road SE, Hanna Place SE, and H Street SE.


==== Changes ====
On December 28, 1991, when Anacostia station opened, U2 was rerouted to operate between the Minnesota Avenue station and Anacostia station via Minnesota Avenue NE/SE, Good Hope Road SE, 16th Street SE (to the Minnesota Avenue), W Street SE (Minnesota Avenue), Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE, and Howard Road SE, instead of operating between Deanwood station & Benning Heights.Route U2's routing between the Deanwood and Minnesota Avenue stations, was replaced by the brand new Minnesota Avenue–M Street Line, or V7, V8, and V9. U2's routing between the intersection of Anacostia Road SE & Minnesota Avenue SE and Hanna Place SE & Benning Road SE, via Minnesota Avenue SE, Ridge Road SE, Anacostia Road SE, B Street SE, Texas Avenue SE, E Street SE, Alabama Avenue SE, H Street SE, Benning Road SE, Hanna Place SE, and H Street SE to its Benning Heights terminus at the intersection of Hanna Place SE & Benning Road SE, was replaced by route V9.On December 18, 2011, new Saturday service was added to the U2 running every 30 minutes between 6:45 AM to 9:45 PM.


==== 2014 Study ====
During WMATA's Fiscal Year of 2015, they announced a series of proposals of simplification affecting the current routes U2, U4, U5, U6, U8, V7, V8, and V9.At the time of the proposals, the routes were suffering from on-time performances, and several bus bunching on the routes. Route U2 will have daily service at all times between Capitol Heights station and Anacostia station via the current U8 route between Capitol Heights station and Minnesota Avenue station via Nannie Helen Burroughs Avenue, then via the current U2 route to Anacostia station.
Route U2 will have daily service at all times between Capitol Heights station and Anacostia station via the current U8 route between Capitol Heights station and Minnesota Avenue station via Nannie Helen Burroughs Avenue, then via the current U2 route to Anacostia station.
Routes V7, V8: Daily service at all times between Capitol Heights station and Navy Yard–Ballpark station via the current U8 route between Capitol Heights station and Minnesota Avenue station, then via the current V7 route to Navy Yard Ballpark station.
Route V9: Peak period service between Benning Heights and Bureau of Engraving via the current V9 route between Benning Heights and Navy Yard Ballpark station, then via the current V7 route to Bureau of Engraving.
Service between Minnesota Avenue station and Deanwood station will be replaced by an extended route U4.
U8 service between Minnesota Avenue and Capitol Heights will be replaced by route U2.The reason for the changes was in order to enhance connectivity between points of regional demand, create a better balance of capacity and demand lines serving the Minnesota Avenue, and to reduce/eliminate service with low productivity on the line. According to WMATA, there will be approximately 700 of 5,300 weekday passenger trips (13%), 750 of 3,200 Saturday passenger trips (23%) and 600 of 2,900 Sunday passenger trips (21%) that will be affected by shortening routes V7 and V8 at Navy Yard Station if the changes occur. Weekday passengers affected may be less due to the proposed extension of route V9.


=== Modified Route ===
On June 21, 2015, route U2 and renamed route V2 and was extended to Capitol Heights station via Nannie Helen Burroughs Avenue and follow U2's routing between Minnesota Avenue station and Anacostia station. Routes V7 and V8 were renamed route V4 which was shorten to Navy Yard–Ballpark station with service between Navy Yard and the Bureau of Engraving being replaced by route V9 which was renamed route V1. The new line will be called the Capitol Heights–Minnesota Avenue Line. Route V2 will operate Monday through Saturday with no Sunday service (the same pattern as the U2), and route V4 will operate daily (the same pattern as routes V7 and V8).
In the process of the changes, route U2, V7, V8, and V9 designation were discontinued, and route U8 was shorten to operate between Minnesota Avenue station and Benning Heights.During the COVID-19 pandemic, Route V2 and V4 was reduced to operate on its Saturday supplemental schedule during the weekdays beginning on March 16, 2020. On March 18, 2020, the line was further reduced to operate on its Sunday schedule with Route V2 being suspended. Weekend service for V4 was later reduced to every 30 minutes on March 21, 2020. The pre-pandemic schedule and V2 service was restored on August 23, 2020.In February 2021 during the FY2022 budget, WMATA proposed to eliminate the V4 and give the V2 daily service to replace it if WMATA does not get federal funding.On June 6, 2021, late night service was added to route V2 daily, adding Sunday Service on route V2 for the first time, while route V4 was shortened late nights to 11:30 pm weekdays and 10:30 pm weekends.On September 5, 2021, Both Routes were increased to every 24 minutes with a combined 12 minutes between Capitol Heights station and Minnesota and Pennsylvania Avenues SE from 7AM - 9PM, with the V2 also getting full Sunday service.


== Incidents ==

53 and 55 Bootham,"53 and 55 Bootham is a historic building on Bootham, immediately north of the city centre of York, in England.
The building was constructed as a single house in about 1765, probably to a design by John Carr.  In about 1770, it was divided to form a pair of houses.  Early in the 19th century, 55 Bootham was extended to the left.  In 1923, the house was purchased by Bootham School, which came to use it as offices.  The building was Grade II* listed in 1954.The building is constructed of brick, with stone and stucco dressings, and a slate roof.  The main part of the front is symmetrical, with three main storeys, an attic and a cellar, and it is five bays wide.  The brickwork of the top floor is different to that of the lower floors, suggesting that it may be a later addition.  A porch in a Greek Doric style covers the twin entrance doors, which each lead into an entrance hall, which widens to accommodate a staircase; that in 53 Bootham has been removed, but the original staircase in 55 Bootham survives.  Much of the original cornice survives, as does one fireplace.  The extension has an additional external door, which leads to a passageway.

WJCP,"WJCP is a full service classic hits-formatted broadcast radio station licensed to North Vernon, Indiana, serving Vernon and Jennings County, Indiana. WJCP is owned and operated by Keith Reising, through licensee Jennings County Promotion Partners, LLC.


== History ==
WJCP was launched on January 8, 1955, as WOCH by Dorrell Ochs. Located in the Ochs' family auto supply business in North Vernon, the station was started with the intent of keeping the local community informed and entertained, while broadcasting Christian programming.Eventually, the station was bought ARS Broadcasting Corporation and carried a middle of the road (MOR) format. At the time, the station carried the WNVI callsign. WNVI changed its callsign to WKRP on August 17, 1989, and back to WNVI on August 8, 1997. Findlay Publishing Company purchased WNVI and its then FM sister-stations WRBI and WWWY for $1.9 million in 1997. For a time, after the sale, WNVI carried a talk format, simulcasting then sister-station WCSI.Findlay Publishing Company sold WNVI, in a swap for WWWY, to Pieratt Communications, Inc. on November 20, 2001. With the sale, the simulcast was WCSI ended and WNVI switched to Adult Standards.

Their friendship develops through an unconventional video correspondence, and as their relationship intensifies, they must decide whether or not to take a chance on meeting face to face.

Salt Springs Reservoir,"Salt Springs Reservoir is a reservoir in the eastern portions of Amador County and Calaveras County of California in the Sierra Nevada about 30 miles (48 km) east-northeast of Jackson. The reservoir is in the Eldorado National Forest at an elevation of 3,900 feet (1,200 m).
The 141,900 acre-foot (175,000,000 m3) reservoir is formed by Salt Springs Dam on the North Fork of the Mokelumne River. The concrete-faced rock-fill dam is 332 feet (101 m) tall and was completed in 1931 (1931). It is owned by Pacific Gas and Electric and its sole purpose is hydroelectricity production, though limited recreation is available. A short pipeline from the reservoir conveys water to the 44 MW Salt Springs Powerhouse. Some of the water is returned to the river downstream, but much of it flows into the Tiger Creek Conduit, a concrete flume that moves water downstream for use in other powerhouses in PG&E's Mokelumne River Project (FERC Project 137).
The dam has a history of settlement problems caused by poor consolidation of the rocks during construction. The concrete face has been cracked many times by the movement, causing leaks. The surface of the dam consists of cracks, craters and shotcrete overlays. It was decided to use a flexible geomembrane to cover the portions of the dam with the greatest leakage. The installation of the membrane was completed in 2005.
The dam is being examined as the lower pool in a 380-1,140 MW pumped-storage project with the Bear River Dam as the upper pool.

Fixin' to Die Blues,"""Fixin' to Die Blues"" is a song by American blues musician Bukka White.   It is performed in the Delta blues style with White's vocal and guitar accompanied by washboard rhythm.  White recorded it in Chicago on May 8, 1940, for record producer Lester Melrose.  The song was written just days before, along with eleven others, at Melrose's urging.


== History ==
White was resuming his recording career, which had been interrupted by his incarceration for two years at the infamous Parchman Farm prison in Mississippi. While there, White witnessed the death of a friend and ""got to wondering how a man feels when he dies"".  His lyrics reflect his thoughts about his children and wife:

White provides the vocal and acoustic slide guitar (which was borrowed from Big Bill Broonzy) with backing by Washboard Sam.  Despite the somber lyrics, ""the music throbs with a restless energy"" with White's ""bottleneck guitar crying in urgent counterpoint to his imagery"". Music historian Ted Gioia notes that these recordings of White ""come as close to art song as traditional blues has ever dared to go, but without losing any of the essential qualities of the Delta heritage"". However, as with his other songs from the session, ""Fixin' to Die Blues"" did not capture the record buying public's interest.  As a result, White largely retired from performing music, until a resurgence of interest in the early 1960s and the American folk music revival.


=== Resurgence and cover versions ===
In 1959, White's recording was included on The Country Blues, an album compiled by Samuel Charters.
In 1961, folksinger Bob Dylan recorded ""Fixin' to Die"" for his debut album, released the following year.  The album liner notes indicate that it ""was learned from an old recording by Bukka White"".  However, Dylan's arrangement uses a different melody line and some new lyrics. It is one of three blues songs on the album that deal with the theme of death.  Dave Van Ronk (Dave Van Ronk, Folksinger) and Buffy Sainte-Marie (Many a Mile) are among Dylan's folk contemporaries who also recorded versions of the song.Stretch recorded it for You Can't Beat Your Brain For Entertainment in 1976.  In 2002, Robert Plant recorded a version titled ""Funny In My Mind (I Believe I'm Fixin' To Die)"" for the Dreamland album.  His former group, Led Zeppelin sometimes included it in live medleys with ""Whole Lotta Love"" (Led Zeppelin BBC Sessions). A live version by Chuck Ragan of Hot Water Music was included on Los Feliz in 2007. Valley Entertainment issued Miss Blues'es Child in 2007,  which included Eli Cook's version. In 2010, G. Love and The Avett Brothers recorded the song as the title track of Fixin' to Die.

Mike Whitmarsh,"Michael John Whitmarsh (May 18, 1962 – February 17, 2009) was an American male volleyball and basketball player. He won the silver medal in the men's inaugural beach volleyball tournament at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, partnering with Mike Dodd. Throughout his volleyball career, Whitmarsh earned over $1.6 million as well as 28 tournament wins.Whitmarsh played college basketball for the San Diego Toreros. He was a two-time all-conference player in the West Coast Athletic Conference (WCAC), known now as the West Coast Conference, and led San Diego to their first-ever conference title in 1984. He played professional basketball for three years in Europe before turning to volleyball.


== Early life ==
Whitmarsh was born in San Diego. He played basketball at Monte Vista High in Spring Valley, California and later Grossmont College in El Cajon. He did not take academics seriously as a freshman at Grossmont. Whitmarsh did not think that he had a chance to get an athletic scholarship until Toreros coach Jim Brovelli showed interest in him. Lacking the units to be admitted into the University of San Diego (USD), Whitmash committed himself to studying.


== College career ==
The 6-foot-7-inch (2.01 m) Whitmarsh played college basketball at USD. He started all 24 games as a junior, averaging 15.3 points and 5.3 rebounds per game and earning all-conference honors in the WCAC. As a senior in 1983–84, he averaged 18.8 points and 7.3 rebounds and led the Toreros to an 18–10 record and the 1984 NCAA tournament. In the final game of the regular season against Saint Mary's, he had 24 points and six rebounds in a 68–59 win to clinch the Torreros' first-ever WCAC title. He was named All-WCAC again, and was runner-up to John Stockton in the voting for the WCAC Player of the Year.


== Professional career ==
Whitmarsh was drafted by the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers in the fifth round in 1984. He also narrowly missed making the roster of the Minnesota Timberwolves, and played professionally in Germany for three years before abandoning basketball in favor of beach volleyball. Transitioning from the indoor hard court to the soft sand of beach volleyball (which is often played under hot and humid conditions) was not easy, and he developed a reputation for cramping late in tournaments.Whitmarsh quickly adapted to the beach with his powerful blocks at the net and won over the fans. In 1990, he was selected as Rookie of the Year by the AVP. In 2001, he was ranked number 1 in the AVP. In 2002, he was named the Best Blocker by the AVP. He retired from beach volleyball in 2004.


== Death ==
Whitmarsh was in the midst of a divorce from his wife Cindy and was found dead in a friend's garage on Wednesday, February 17, 2009, leaving behind two young daughters. According to the San Diego County medical examiner, he died of suicide from inhalation of carbon monoxide from automobile exhaust.

An Open Secret,"An Open Secret is a 2014 American documentary film directed by Amy J. Berg exposing child sexual abuse in the film industry in California.


== Production history ==
Berg decided to make the documentary after she was approached by Matthew Valentinas in 2011. Valentinas and Gabe Hoffman wanted to make a film about victims of sexual exploitation. Valentinas said, ""We chose Amy because we didn't want it to be exploitative or tabloid. We wanted it to be empowering for the victims."" Matthew Valentinas, an entertainment lawyer, came up with the idea when he heard Corey Feldman talking about his sexual abuse as a child actor in a TV interview. Berg's 2006 film Deliver Us from Evil, a documentary on systemic child sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, had been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.
After the film's premiere at Doc NYC, it was re-edited to remove mention of Michael Egan's 2014 lawsuit against Bryan Singer and three other Hollywood figures. In October 2015, after beginning a limited theatrical release in the United States, the film was re-edited again,  so as to receive a PG-13 rating. The film was originally rated R for graphic language. To acquire the PG-13 rating, the only change made to the film was a censoring of the word ""blowjob"" in two instances.


== Synopsis ==
The documentary follows the stories of five former child actors who were sexually abused by multiple predators. Much of the film focuses on Marc Collins-Rector, who was convicted of child sexual abuse, and co-owned and operated Digital Entertainment Network, with Brock Pierce also owning a minor share. DEN produced brief online videos during the early days of the Internet, and was noted for wild parties featuring underage boys at Collins-Rector's house.The film makes multiple references to director Bryan Singer, who was allegedly at some of the DEN parties, but does not detail allegations against him. A lawsuit alleging that Singer sexually abused Michael Egan as an underage boy was withdrawn during the production of the film. As a result, the film only details allegations made by persons willing to appear on camera.Among the people interviewed is Vanity Fair journalist John Connolly, who states that an article on pedophilia in Hollywood was dropped at the last minute by Details magazine.


== Reception ==
An Open Secret has an approval rating of 88% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on reviews from 17 critics. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 66 out of 100 based on reviews from nine critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"".The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film offered a ""sober look at accusations that lend themselves to sensationalism.""The Los Angeles Times describes the movie as ""not the hard-hitting exposé that it aims to be"" but as ""an unsettling look at pedophilia in Hollywood"".The New York Times wrote that the ""topic deserves a tenacious call for answers"" and hoped for ""further aggressive reporting"" which they missed in the movie, when Berg linked Martin Weiss ""to a string of other men"" but only presenting ""a secretly taped conversation and some menacing music"".Flavorwire claims that ""the film feels less shocking as a cult-of-celebrity document and more just quietly horrifying, as it details the trauma and the abuse of power inflicted on young men with stars in their eyes.""Indiewire described the documentary as ""an incisive and utterly unflinching look at a subject too rarely scrutinized.""Actor Elijah Wood praised the film in 2016 as ""a powerful documentary"".


== Controversy ==
On July 30, 2015, Deadline Hollywood reported that the producers of An Open Secret accused Berg of not supporting the film. Producers Gabe Hoffman and Matthew Valentinas filed an arbitration against Berg for allegedly delivering the movie late and incomplete, and failing to promote it. Hoffman's Esponda Productions claimed that Berg failed to get the proper release forms from some of the interviewees and that this error almost caused the film to miss its premiere at Doc NYC.Another controversy arose when the Huffington Post reported that two of the movie's subjects, Evan Henzi and Chris Turcotte, had called the documentary ""unfair"" and ""dishonest"". In another Huffington Post article, Turcotte said that Berg omitted portions of his interview from the movie, detailing that Collins-Rector had sex at the estate with underage teens in private, but not during sex parties.In June 2015, The Hollywood Reporter wrote of Egan's lawsuit, ""His cases against the four men began to collapse in May 2014, just a month after they were filed, when his prior contradictory statements came to light"". Egan's attorneys, Jeff Herman and Mark Gallagher, later settled with Garth Ancier and David Neuman and issued an apology that called the allegations ""untrue"" and paid a seven-figure settlement to both. Neither Singer nor Gary Goddard received an apology because they didn't file countersuits as Ancier and Neuman had, although ""Egan’s cases against all four were framed in virtually identical complaints and centered on the same purported events, timeframes, locations and supposed trip(s) to Hawaii"". After Egan's lawsuits were dropped, The Hollywood Reporter wrote that Berg was still ""convinced of Egan’s general credibility."" In 2019, The Atlantic reported that there ""are reasons to believe Egan may have been abused.""The documentary previously named all four men in connection with the 2014 lawsuits, but was edited to remove those references.


== Release ==
An Open Secret premiered on November 14, 2014 at Doc NYC. It screened at Cannes Film Festival on May 19, 2015, and began a limited theatrical release in the United States on June 5 of that year. Producers were encouraged about its commercial potential because a pirated version was viewed 900,000 times. However, the film received no television deal or video-on-demand distribution. According to Gabe Hoffman, who financed the film: ""We got zero Hollywood offers to distribute the film. Not even one. Literally no offers for any price whatsoever.""On October 12, 2017, Hoffman and Valentinas released the film for nine days on Vimeo ""to commemorate serial predator Harvey Weinstein finally being exposed."" It went viral, and free viewing was then extended for a longer period due to the interest shown in the film, with over three million viewings garnered on various social media platforms in the first two weeks.At the time of its Vimeo release, the producers said they were seeking further distribution of the documentary. It has not been released to home video.

Shanghai Tunnel Bar,"Shanghai Tunnel Bar, or simply Shanghai Tunnel, is a dive bar and Asian restaurant in the Old Town Chinatown neighborhood of Portland, Oregon. Named after the city's Shanghai tunnels, the underground bar serves Asian-themed cocktails and foods such as BLTs, Chinese chicken salad, miso and noodle soup, quesadillas, and veggie burgers. Owned by Phil Ragaway, Shanghai Tunnel is known for its inexpensive drinks and pinball machines. The bar closed temporarily during the COVID-19 pandemic, and later offered street-level service.


== Description ==
Named after Portland's Shanghai tunnels and located near Burnside Street in Old Town Chinatown, Shanghai Tunnel Bar has been described by Willamette Week's Suzette Smith as a ""gruff but lovable"" and ""dank, brick-lined basement"" dive bar with pinball and ""friendship"" (side-by-side) toilets in the women's restroom. The Oregonian's Grant Butler said the subterranean bar has an ""almost dungeon-like feel, with glowing lanterns meant to evoke the early Portland era when underground tunnels were home to all sorts of criminal enterprise"".
The business serves Asian-themed cocktails such as the Crouching Tiger, named after the film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000). According to a Rough Guide published in 2004, the bar is popular with hipsters and serves Asian-style soul food. Food options in 1998 included BLTs, Chinese chicken salad, miso and noodle soup, quesadillas, and veggie burgers; the drink menu included beer, wine, and bourbon and Scotch whisky. In a 2015 overview of Portland's underground bars, Jon Shadel of the Portland Mercury described Shanghai Tunnel as a ""bro-ish"" dive and wrote: At ground level, the bar may appear dead and a bit sketchy, but wander downstairs and you'll discover a dungeon-like liquor haven lit with paper lanterns. The bar has become a weekend institution on downtown's frat-party circuit ... Half a dozen pinball machines line a wall, and flannel-clad guys wearing Blazers caps chat up girls in miniskirts sitting around tables sticky with spilt PBR.
For the newspaper's similar overview the following year, Thomas Ross wrote, ""One full floor underground, the only hint of daylight is the blazing digital sun in HD on the Buck Hunter screen."" In 2021, a Willamette Week article said: ""It's possible that Shanghai is the last chill bar in Old Town where you can hole up—waiting out the weekend warriors—to play a little pool, pinball or Big Buck Hunter Pro.""


== History ==
Shanghai Tunnel is owned by Phil Ragaway. In 2004, the bar was hosting Rock Bingo on the last Sunday of each month. Shanghai Tunnel was the starting point for villains participating in Power Struggle, a ""heroes-vs.-villains"" pub crawl hosted by the Alter Egos Society as part of Stumptown Comics Fest and Portland's Comics Month, in 2010. In 2017, the bar had at least five pinball machines.It closed temporarily during the COVID-19 pandemic, reopening in May 2021. According to Willamette Week, ""As it reopened this summer, Shanghai's focus shifted from its basement to the small street-level bar and patio—located next to the breezeway of the front door.""


== Reception ==

In her Portland Happy Hour Guidebook (2008), Cindy Anderson said that the bar had the ""best pot stickers [Chinese dumplings] ever"". In Thrillist's 2014 guide to Old Town Chinatown, Katherine Vetrano recommended Shanghai Tunnel ""for end of the week annihilation"" and wrote: ""You've had the week (or day) from hell, and your plan is to hole up in the dark and drink the memory of it away: Shanghai is your spot. Drinks are strong and cheap ($2 wells during happy hour), and you'll want to order their Zapata for eating — it's house-made chips with both chew and crunch, dipped in hot queso."" In 2015, the Portland Mercury's Jon Shadel recommended visiting in mid-week (to avoid crowds) and wrote: ""An Asian-themed food menu offers a nice respite from the typical burgers-and-truffle-fries fare found in other nearby establishments—the panko-crusted tofu with noodles in peanut sauce satisfies drunk hunger quite nicely."" In her 2016 Moon guide book of Portland, Hollyanna McCollom wrote:The dark, seedy journey into the bowels of Old Town is part of the novelty, but it's also a pretty good bar. Skip straight to the narrow staircase to the basement, where the cocktails are stellar and pool is $0.50 a pop. Shanghai isn't classy, but that's okay because it never means to be. 
Thrillist's Pete Cottell wrote in his 2019 overview of ""what to do after dark"" that Shanghai Tunnel ""has plenty of pinball machines and cheap tallboys to kill an hour or two"".

Tinga (dish),"Chicken Tinga (Spanish: tinga de pollo) is a Mexican dish made with shredded chicken in a sauce made from tomatoes, chipotle chilis in adobo, and sliced onions. It is often served on a tostada and accompanied by a layer of refried beans. It can be topped with avocado slices, crumbled cheese, Mexican crema, and salsa.


== Origin ==
Although tinga is consumed throughout central and southern Mexico today, it is presumed to have a Pueblan origin. In recent years this cuisine has been expanding across the borders and can be found in most Mexican restaurants. Determining the exact place ""tinga"" originated is difficult due to the lack of sufficient records and information about the dish.In his Dictionary of Mexicanisms (1895), Francisco J. Santamaría defines ""tinga"" as a colloquial term to refer to something ""vulgar"" or ""disorderly"", though he does not give the etymology of the word.

NGC 6756 lies 30′ to the northeast of NGC 6755, with the pair forming a visual double cluster. However, they probably do not form a binary cluster system since they have different ages and are too distant from each other.This cluster has a Trumpler class of II2r with a visual magnitude of 7.5 and it spans an angular size 15′. It has an estimated age of 250 million years, based on the main sequence turnoff. A total of 71 variable stars have been detected in the field of this cluster, of which 31 are eclipsing binaries, seven are pulsating variables, and 28 are most likely irregular variable red giants.

Old Economy Village,"Old Economy Village is an historic settlement that is located in Ambridge, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, United States. Administered by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, it lies on the banks of the Ohio River and is surrounded by downtown Ambridge.
The village is the last of three settlements established by the Harmony Society in the United States (another in Pennsylvania and one in Indiana). Founded in 1824, it was designated as a National Historic Landmark District in 1966 under the name of ""Old Economy.""


== Harmony Society ==

The Harmony Society was a Christian theosophy and pietist society founded in Iptingen, Germany, in 1785. Due to religious persecution by the Lutheran Church and the government in Württemberg, the Harmony Society moved to the United States between 1803 and 1804, initially purchasing 3,000 acres (12 km2) of land in Butler County, Pennsylvania. On February 15, 1805, society leaders, together with about 400 followers, formally organized the Harmony Society, placing all of their goods in common.
The society was founded and led by Johann Georg Rapp (1757–1847) and his adopted son, Frederick (Reichert) Rapp (1775–1834), and lasted for 100 years – roughly from 1805 until 1905.  Members of the society were sometimes called Harmonists, Harmonites, or Rappites.
The Harmony Society is best known for its worldly successes, eventually building three successive communities, first at Harmony, Pennsylvania (1804–1814), then New Harmony, Indiana (1814–1824), finally settling in Economy (now Ambridge, Pennsylvania).


== Old Economy Village, Pennsylvania ==
The Harmonites named their last town Economy, after the spiritual notion of the Divine Economy. Here, under the business acumen and efficient management of Frederick Rapp, society members enjoyed such prosperity that, by 1829, they dominated the trade and the markets of Pittsburgh and down the Ohio River. Accused of being a monopoly, the society faced pressure to dissolve. At this time, the community was not neglectful of matters pertaining to art and culture. Frederick Rapp purchased and installed a museum, containing fine paintings and many curios and antiquities; they had a deer park, a floral park, and a maze, or labyrinth; the society also had a good orchestra, were fond of music, and gave much attention to its cultivation.
In 1832, the society suffered a serious division. Of 750 members, 250 became alienated through the influence of Bernhard Müller (self-styled Count de Leon), who, with forty followers (also at variance with the authorities in the old country), had come to Economy to affiliate with the society. Rapp and Leon could not agree; a separation and apportionment of the property were therefore effected. This secession of one-third of the society, consisting mostly of the young men and women who did not want to maintain the custom of celibacy, reportedly broke Frederick's heart. He died within two years.
It also resulted in a considerable fracturing of the community. Nevertheless, the society remained prosperous in business investments for many more years to come.
After Frederick Rapp's death, in 1834, the business management passed successively into the hands of George Rapp, who died in 1847 (R. L, Baker and Jacob Henrici, 1847–69;  J. Henrici and Jonathan Lenz, 1869–92;  J. S. Duss, 1892–1903; Susie C. Duss, 1903–06).

The settlements were economically successful, producing many goods in a clothing factory, a sawmill, a tannery, and from their vineyards and distillery. Society members also produced high quality silk for garments.
The Harmonites were industrious and utilized the latest technologies of the day in their factories. In Economy, the group aided the construction of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, established the Economy Savings Institution and the Economy Brick Works, and operated the Economy Oil Company, Economy Planing Mill, Economy Lumber Company, and eventually donated some land in Beaver Falls for the construction of Geneva College. The society exerted a major influence on the economic development of Western Pennsylvania. But since the group chose to adopt celibacy and the people in the group kept getting older, more work gradually had to be hired out.
The high-water mark of the society's prosperity was at the close of the administration of R. L. Baker in 1868; its wealth at that time being probably $2,000,000. By 1890, however, it was hopelessly in debt, on the verge of bankruptcy, with a depleted membership of aged people. The society was overwhelmed with litigation on the part of would-be heirs. J. S. Duss won the lawsuits and paid the society's indebtedness. The great strain which he had undergone undermining his health, he was forced to resign his trusteeship in 1903. There being but few members left, the remaining land and assets were sold under the leadership of Duss's wife, and the society was formally dissolved in 1906.
In 1916, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania acquired 6 acres (0.024 km2) and 17 buildings of Old Economy, which became the present-day historic site. Other parts of the society's land were acquired by the American Bridge Company to expand the borough of Ambridge.  Today, much of Ambridge outside of Old Economy Village is a historic district (the Economy Historic District) listed on the National Register of Historic Places.


== George Rapp ==

Johann Georg Rapp (November 1, 1757 – August 7, 1847) was the founder of the religious sect called Harmonists, Harmonites, Rappites, or the Harmony Society.
Born in Iptingen, Duchy of Württemberg, Germany, Rapp became inspired by the philosophies of Jakob Böhme, Philipp Jakob Spener, and Emanuel Swedenborg, among others.  In the 1780s, George Rapp began preaching and soon started to gather a group of his own followers.  His group officially split with the Lutheran Church in 1785 and was promptly banned from meeting.  The persecution that Rapp and his followers experienced caused them to leave Germany and come to the United States in 1803.  Rapp was a Pietist, and a number of his beliefs were shared by the Anabaptists, as well as groups such as the Shakers.  Rapp's religious beliefs and philosophy were the cement that held his community together both in Germany and in America – a Christian community and commune, which in America organized as the Harmony Society.  The Harmony Society built three American towns, became rich, famous, and survived for 100 years – roughly from 1805 until 1905. By 1798, Rapp and his group of followers had already begun to distance themselves from mainstream society.  In the Lomersheimer Declaration, written in 1798, Rapp's followers refused to serve in the military or attend Lutheran schools. In 1803, when the government began to persecute Rapp's followers, he decided to move the entire group to the United States.  The initial move scattered the followers and reduced Rapp's original group of 12,000 to many fewer persons. In 1804, Rapp was able to secure a large tract of land in Pennsylvania and started his first commune.  This first commune, 'Harmonie', (Harmony), Butler County, Pennsylvania, soon grew to a population of about 800, and was highly profitable. At Harmony, the Harmony Society was created and its members contracted to hold all property in common, to submit to spiritual and material leadership by Rapp and associates, and adopted the celibate lifestyle. In 1814, the first town was sold to Mennonites for 10 times the amount originally paid for the land, and the entire commune moved out west to Indiana where their new town was also known as Harmony. Ten years after the move to Indiana the commune moved again, this time it returned to Pennsylvania and named their town 'Ökonomie', Economy. The Indiana settlement was sold to Robert Owen, at which point it was renamed New Harmony, Indiana. George Rapp lived out his remaining days in the town of Economy, Pennsylvania, until August 7, 1847, when he died at the age of 89. The commune ultimately failed because the policy of celibacy prevented new members from within, and the majority of the outside world had no desire to give up so much to live in a commune. The society was formally dissolved in 1906. Today, many of their remaining buildings are preserved and open to visitors.  The entire village was designated as a National Historic Landmark District in 1965.

Good Will Hunting,"Good Will Hunting is a 1997 American psychological drama film directed by Gus Van Sant, and written by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. It stars Robin Williams, Damon, Affleck, Stellan Skarsgård and Minnie Driver.
The film received positive reviews from critics and grossed over $225 million during its theatrical run against a $10 million budget. At the 70th Academy Awards, it received nominations in nine categories, including Best Picture and Best Director, and won in two: Best Supporting Actor for Williams and Best Original Screenplay for Affleck and Damon. In 2014, it was ranked at number 53 in The Hollywood Reporter's ""100 Favorite Films"" list.


== Plot ==
Twenty-year-old Will Hunting of South Boston is a natural, self-taught genius who was recently paroled from jail. He works as a janitor at MIT and spends his free time drinking with his friends Chuckie, Billy and Morgan. When Professor Gerald Lambeau posts a difficult combinatorial mathematics problem on a blackboard as a challenge for his graduate students, Will solves the problem anonymously, stunning both the students and Lambeau. As a challenge to the unknown genius, Lambeau posts an even more difficult problem; he later catches Will writing the solution on the blackboard late at night, but initially thinks Will is vandalizing it and chases him off. At a bar, Will meets Skylar, a British woman about to graduate from Harvard College, who plans on attending medical school at Stanford.
The next day, Will and his friends get in a fight with a gang that includes a member who used to bully Will as a child. Will is arrested after he attacks a responding police officer. Lambeau sits in on his court appearance and watches Will defend himself. He arranges for Will to avoid jail time if he agrees to study mathematics under Lambeau's supervision and participate in psychotherapy sessions. Will agrees but treats his therapists with mockery. In desperation, Lambeau calls on Dr. Sean Maguire, his college roommate, who now teaches psychology at Bunker Hill Community College. Unlike other therapists, Sean actually challenges Will's defense mechanisms. During the first session, Will insults Sean's deceased wife, and Sean threatens him, but after a few unproductive sessions, Will finally begins to open up.
Will is particularly struck by Sean's story of how he met his wife, who later died of cancer, by giving up his ticket to the historic game six of the 1975 World Series after falling in love at first sight. Sean's explanation for surrendering his ticket was to ""see about a girl"", and he does not regret his decision. This encourages Will to build a relationship with Skylar, though he lies to her about his past and is reluctant to introduce her to his friends or show her his home. Will also challenges Sean to take an objective look at his own life, since Sean cannot move on from his wife's death.
Lambeau sets up a number of job interviews for Will, but Will scorns them by sending Chuckie as his ""chief negotiator"", and by turning down a position at the NSA with a scathing critique of the agency's moral position. Skylar asks Will to move to California with her, but he refuses and tells her he is an orphan, and that his foster father physically abused him. Will breaks up with Skylar and later storms out on Lambeau, dismissing the mathematical research he has been doing. Sean points out that Will is so adept at anticipating future failure in his interpersonal relationships that he deliberately sabotages them to avoid emotional pain. Chuckie likewise challenges Will over his resistance to taking any of the positions he interviews for, telling Will he owes it to his friends to make the most of the opportunities they will never have, even if it means leaving one day. He then tells Will that the best part of his day is a brief moment when he waits on his doorstep, thinking Will has moved on to something greater.
Will walks in on a heated argument between Sean and Lambeau over Will's potential. Sean and Will talk and realize that they were both victims of child abuse. Sean helps Will see that he is a victim of his own inner demons and to accept that it is not his fault, causing him to break down in tears in Sean's arms. Will accepts one of the job offers arranged by Lambeau. Having helped Will manage his problems, Sean reconciles with Lambeau, deciding to take a sabbatical. Will's friends give him a used car for his 21st birthday so he can commute to work. Later, Chuckie goes to Will's house to pick him up, only to find that he is not there, much to his happiness. Will leaves a note for Sean asking him to tell Lambeau that he had to go ""see about a girl"", revealing he passed on the job offer and instead is heading to California to reunite with Skylar.

=== Development ===
Matt Damon started writing the film as a final assignment for a playwriting class he was taking at Harvard University. Instead of writing a one-act play, Damon submitted a 40-page script. He wrote his then-girlfriend, medical student Skylar Satenstein (credited in the closing credits of the film), into his script. Damon said the only scene from that script that survived – ""it survived verbatim"" – was when Will Hunting (Damon) meets his therapist, Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), for the first time. Damon asked Ben Affleck to develop the screenplay together. They completed the script in 1994. At first, it was written as a thriller about a young man in the rough-and-tumble streets of South Boston who possesses a superior intelligence and is targeted by the government with heavy-handed recruitment.Castle Rock Entertainment bought the script for $675,000 against $775,000, meaning that Damon and Affleck would stand to earn an additional $100,000 if the film was produced and they retained sole writing credit. Castle Rock president Rob Reiner urged them to drop the thriller aspect of the story and to focus on the relationship between Will and his therapist. Terrence Malick told Affleck and Damon over dinner that the film ought to end with Will's decision to follow his girlfriend Skylar to California, not them leaving together.At Reiner's request, screenwriter William Goldman read the script. Goldman consistently denied the persistent rumor that he wrote Good Will Hunting or acted as a script doctor. In his book Which Lie Did I Tell? Goldman jokingly writes, ""I did not just doctor it. I wrote the whole thing from scratch,"" before dismissing the rumor as false and saying his only advice was agreeing with Reiner's suggestion.Affleck and Damon proposed to act in the lead roles, but many studio executives said they wanted Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio. Meanwhile, Kevin Smith was working with Affleck on Mallrats and with both Damon and Affleck on Chasing Amy. Castle Rock put the script in turnaround, and gave Damon and Affleck 30 days to find another buyer for the script who would reimburse Castle Rock the money paid, otherwise the script reverted to the studio, and Damon and Affleck would be out. All the studios that were involved in the original bidding war for the screenplay now turned the pair down, taking meetings with Affleck and Damon only to tell them this to their face. As a last resort, Affleck passed the script to his Chasing Amy director Kevin Smith, who read it and promised to walk the script directly into Harvey Weinstein's office at Miramax. Weinstein read the script, loved it, and paid Castle Rock their due, while also agreeing to let Damon and Affleck star in the film. Weinstein asked that a few scenes be removed, including an out-of-place, mid-script oral sex scene that Damon and Affleck added to trick executives who were not looking closely.
After buying the rights from Castle Rock, Miramax put the film into production. Several well-known filmmakers were originally considered to direct, including Mel Gibson and Michael Mann. Originally, Affleck asked Kevin Smith whether he was interested in directing. He declined, saying they needed a ""good director,"" that he only directed projects he wrote, and that he was not much of a visual director, but he still served as one of the film's co-executive producers. Damon and Affleck later chose Gus Van Sant for the job, whose work on previous films like Drugstore Cowboy (1989) had left a favorable impression on the fledgling screenwriters. Miramax was persuaded and hired Van Sant to direct the film.


=== Filming ===
Filming took place between April and June 1997. Although the story is set in Boston, and many of the scenes were shot on location in the Greater Boston area, many of the interior shots were filmed at locations in Toronto, with the University of Toronto standing in for MIT and Harvard University. The classroom scenes were filmed at McLennan Physical Laboratories (of the University of Toronto) and Central Technical School. Harvard normally disallows filming on its property, but permitted limited filming by the project after intervention by Harvard alumnus John Lithgow. Likewise, only the exterior shots of Bunker Hill Community College were filmed in Boston; however, Sean's office was built in Toronto as an exact replica of one at the college.The interior bar scenes set in ""Southie"" were shot on location at Woody's L Street Tavern. Meanwhile, the homes of Will (190 West 6th Street) and Sean (259 E Street), while some distance apart in the movie, actually back up to each other on Bowen Street, the narrow street Chuckie drives down to walk up to Will's back door.The Bow and Arrow Pub, which was located at the corner of Bow Street and Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge, doubled as the exterior of the Harvard bar in which Will met Skylar for the first time. The Baskin-Robbins/Dunkin' Donuts featured in the ""How do you like them apples?"" scene was next door to the pub at the time of the film's release.  The Harvard Bar interior scenes were filmed at the Upfront Bar and Grill on Front St. E. in Toronto.The Tasty, at the corner of JFK and Brattle Streets, was the scene of Will and Skylar's first kiss. The Au Bon Pain, where Will and Skylar discuss the former's photographic memory, was at the corner of Dunster Street and Mass Ave.The Boston Public Garden bench on which Will and Sean sat for a scene in the film became a temporary shrine after Williams's death in 2014.


== Soundtrack ==
The musical score for Good Will Hunting was composed by Danny Elfman, who had previously collaborated with Gus Van Sant on To Die For and would go on to score many of the director's other films. The film also features many songs written and recorded by singer-songwriter Elliott Smith. His song ""Miss Misery"" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song, but lost to ""My Heart Will Go On"" from Titanic. Elfman's score was also nominated for an Oscar, but lost to Titanic as well. On September 11, 2006, The Today Show used Elfman's song ""Weepy Donuts"" while Matt Lauer spoke during the opening credits.
A soundtrack album for the film was released by Capitol Records on November 18, 1997, though only two of Elfman's cues appear on the release.

""Afternoon Delight"" by the Starland Vocal Band was featured in the film, but did not appear on the soundtrack album.

A limited edition soundtrack album featuring Elfman's complete score from the film was released by Music Box Records on March 3, 2014. The soundtrack, issued in 1500 copies, includes all of Elfman's cues (including music not featured on the rare Miramax Academy promo) and also contains the songs by Elliott Smith. One of the tracks is Smith's songs with Elfman's arrangements added into the mix.

== Mathematics ==
In an early version of the script, Will Hunting was going to be a physics prodigy, but Nobel Laureate in Physics Sheldon Glashow at Harvard told Damon that the subject should be math instead of physics. Glashow referred Damon to his brother-in-law, Daniel Kleitman, a mathematics professor at MIT. Columbia University's physics and math professor Brian Greene at the Tribeca Sloan retrospectively explained that for physics, ""Having some deep insight about the universe [⁠ ⁠.⁠ ⁠.⁠ ⁠.⁠ ⁠] typically [⁠ ⁠is ⁠] a group project in the modern era,"" while ""doing some mathematical theorem is a singular undertaking very often."" In the spring of 1997, Damon and Affleck asked Kleitman to ""speak math to us"" for writing realistic dialogue, so Kleitman invited postdoc Tom Bohman to join him, giving them a ""quick lecture"". When asked for a problem that Will could solve, Kleitman and Bohman suggested the unsolved computer science P versus NP problem, but the movie used other problems.
Patrick O'Donnell, professor of physics at the University of Toronto, served as the mathematical consultant for the film.The main hallway blackboard is used twice to reveal Will Hunting's talent, first to the audience, second to Professor Lambeau. Matt Damon based it on his artist brother Kyle visiting MIT's Infinite Corridor and writing ""an incredibly elaborate, totally fake, version of an equation"" on a blackboard, which lasted for months. Kyle returned to Matt, saying that MIT needed those blackboards ""because these kids are so smart they just need to, you know, drop everything and solve problems!""


=== The first blackboard problem ===
Near the start of the film, Will sets aside his mop to study a difficult problem posed by Lambeau on the blackboard. The problem has to do with intermediate-level graph theory, but Lambeau describes it as an advanced ""Fourier system.""
To answer the first part of the question, Will chalks up an adjacency matrix:

  To answer the second part, he determines the number of 3-step walks in the graph, and finds the third power matrix:

  
    
      
        
          A

=== Critical response ===
The film was met with highly positive reviews. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on 90 reviews, with an average rating of 8.10/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""It follows a predictable narrative arc, but Good Will Hunting adds enough quirks to the journey – and is loaded with enough powerful performances – that it remains an entertaining, emotionally rich drama."" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 70 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""A"" on an A+ to F scale.Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four, writing that while the story is ""predictable"", it is ""the individual moments, not the payoff, that make it so effective"". Duane Byrge of The Hollywood Reporter praised the performances of the cast, writing ""The acting is brilliant overall, with special praise to Matt Damon for his ragingly tender portrayal of the boy cursed with genius"". Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle was equally positive, writing ""The glow goes well beyond a radiant performance by Matt Damon ... Intimate, heartfelt and wickedly funny, it's a movie whose impact lingers"". Owen Gleiberman, writing for Entertainment Weekly, gave the film a ""B"", stating ""Good Will Hunting is stuffed – indeed, overstuffed – with heart, soul, audacity, and blarney. You may not believe a minute of it, but you don't necessarily want to stop watching"". He also noted Damon's and Williams' chemistry, describing it as ""a quicksilver intercepting each other's thoughts"". Janet Maslin of The New York Times, called the screenplay ""smart and touching"", and praised Van Sant for directing with ""style, shrewdness and clarity"". She also complimented the production design and cinematography, which were able to effortlessly move the viewer from ""classroom to dorm room to neighborhood bar"", in a small setting.Quentin Curtis of The Daily Telegraph opined Williams' performance brought ""sharpness and tenderness"", calling the film a ""crowd-pleaser, with bags of charm to spare. It doesn't bear thinking too much about its message ... Damon and Affleck's writing has real wit and vigour, and some depth"". Andrew O'Hehir of Salon stated that despite the ""enjoyable characters"", he thought the film was somewhat superficial, writing ""there isn't a whole lot of movie to take home with you ... many will wake the next morning wondering why, with all that talent on hand, it amounts to so little in the end"". Writing for the BBC, Nev Pierce gave the film four stars out of five, describing the film as ""touching, without being sentimental"", although he felt some scenes were ""odd lapses into self-help speak"". Emanuel Levy of Variety called the film a ""beautifully realized tale ... engaging and often quite touching"". He felt that the film's visual style showcased Van Sant's talent, but the plot was ""quite predictable"".


=== Academic response ===
Several scholars have examined the role of class, religion and the cultural geography of Boston in the film. Jeffrey Herlihy-Mera observed that the residual Catholic–Protestant tensions in Boston are an important backdrop in the film, as Irish Catholics from Southie are aligned against ostensibly Protestant characters who are affiliated with Harvard and MIT. Emmett Winn has argued that character interactions show class conflict and stunted social mobility, while, similarly, David Lipset commented that class inequality is a driving subtext.

Michael C. Mitchell,"Michael C. Mitchell (born January 4, 1946) is an American planner, designer, lecturer and environmentalist. He works on rural development.


== Earlier career ==
At Portland State University, Mitchell became one of the organizers of the First Earth Day in 1970, coordinating universities throughout America's northwest states.[citation needed] After his work on the First Earth Day, he was one of ten university students selected from across the nation by President Richard Nixon's Administration to form a national Youth Advisory Board on environmental matters, S.C.O.P.E (Student Council on Pollution and the Environment) was assigned to the U.S. Department of Interior where Mitchell was a reviewer on the creation of the first Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).
Mitchell continued his work with what became the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), writing an environmental education program for students.[citation needed]


== MCM Group International ==
MCM Group is an international planning and design firm headquartered in Los Angeles. Founded in 1984 by Michael C. Mitchell after the close of the Los Angeles Olympic Games, where he served as the head of planning and operations, the firm has sought to expand those planning techniques as a model to address prominent social problems. MCM Group provides feasibility consulting, planning, architecture, landscape design and sustainable engineering services. Mitchell has developed offices in Tokyo, Moscow, Middle East offices in Doha, Qatar, an African base in Nairobi, Kenya and currently four offices in China, with its headquarters in Beijing.


== 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympic Games ==
In the early 1980s, Mitchell was recruited by the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee, where he served as the Group vice-president of Planning and Control (Finance). Among his duties included overseeing the planning of the Olympic venues and supervising the architectural department's venue planning. During the Olympics he was responsible for the Games Operations Center and oversaw the closeout of the Games after their completion.He has since served as a senior planning consultant to six other Olympic Games and four World Fairs.


== LA84 Foundation ==
As head of the close-out operations after the completion of the Los Angeles 1984 Summer Olympics, Mitchell oversaw the creation of the LA84 Foundation, which was formed out of the $225 million surplus from the operations of the Games. The Foundation is now a national leader in supporting youth programs, providing recreation and learning opportunities to disadvantaged youth, training youth coaches and convening national conferences on youth sports issues.


== Live Aid ==
In the Spring of 1985, Mitchell was contacted by Bob Geldof, an Irish rock musician, that had been working on issues of drought and famine in Africa. Geldof asked Mitchell to produce a worldwide televised music show to raise funds to help alleviate the catastrophic consequences of the worst African famine in a century.
Mitchell became the Executive Producer of the worldwide Live Aid broadcast (under a newly formed venture Worldwide Sports and Entertainment) and President of the Live Aid Foundation in America.The July 13, 1985 broadcast was the world's first large globally interactive show seen by 1.5 billion viewers in 150 countries.  Whereas the 1984 Olympics utilized three satellites to beam from one location around the world, Live Aid utilized thirteen satellites sending and receiving concerts from seven locations from around the world and producing one international feed back to the 150 nations. Despite 1985 being at the height of the Cold War, Mitchell established a global broadcast with a live concert from the Soviet Union featuring Autograph, and a delayed Live Aid showing in China.President Ronald Reagan's Administration supported the Live Aid Foundation by providing wheat from America's reserves and awarded Mitchell a Presidential Citation for the Live Aid Foundation's contributions to humanity.


== NFIE ==
Mitchell continued his contributions to social and education programs by accepting an appointment to the Board of the National Education Association's Foundation for the Improvement of Education (NFIE), serving on the board from 1987 to 1997. Since its beginning in 1969, the Foundation has served as a laboratory of learning, offering funding and other resources to public school educators, their schools, and districts to solve complex teaching and learning challenges.


== Fund for Democracy and Development ==
During the dissolution of the Soviet Union starting in 1990, Russia and Ukraine experienced a severe shortage of medical and food supplies. Working throughout both countries witnessing first-hand the growing crisis, Mitchell and his close friend, Yankel Ginzburg, an American artist and humanitarian, who had family in Tver, Russia, responded to requests by Russia's leadership for assistance, co-founding the ""Fund for Democracy and Development"" to provide aid to alleviate the crisis.Mitchell served as the founding board chairman in 1991 and L. Ronald Scheman (co-founder of the Pan American Development Foundation, where his work included providing financial assistance to low-income rural communities), served as the first President. Past President Richard M. Nixon served as the honorary chairman of the Fund.From 1991 to 1994 the Fund is credited with channeling 240 million dollars worth of staples and food supplies to the former Soviet Union. As gratitude for the contributions of the Fund, the Russian government commissioned a monument park to reflect American goodwill.


== Amur Tiger Sanctuary ==
With offices established in Moscow and St. Petersburg, Mitchell contributed to several rural development and environmental projects across the former Soviet Union. Mitchell's planning of development projects in rural Russia included work in Siberia on sustainable resource and forest management practices.
While undertaking those projects in conjunction with local wildlife scientists Mitchell convinced the Prime Minister of Russia, Viktor Chernomyrdin, to establish the Amur Tiger Sanctuary in 1993, which was initially funded through the Global Survival Network (GSN), an environmental organization he co-founded with Steve Galster now of Freeland Foundation.The Sanctuary included introducing armed ranger patrols to stop the threat that poachers played in the region. The initial work that Mitchell and the executive director of GSN, Steve Galster, did to establish the sanctuary was soon funded by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), now known as World Wide Fund for Nature, and is currently carried out with the support of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (Russia). As a result of this work, the wild Siberian Tiger population has rebounded from their critical endangered level.


== Exposing animal and human trafficking ==
In order to strengthen the Sanctuary efforts to stop poaching, Mitchell worked with Steve Galster conducting undercover video interviews with the poachers. Through these undercover meetings, he and Galster discovered a link between animal poachers and human traffickers. What began as an effort to preserve habitat became an international exposé on trafficking. From 1995 to 1997 they undertook a two-year undercover investigation personally holding meetings with traffickers and trafficked women to expose the international relationship between animal and human trafficking.
Information and undercover video derived from their investigation were used to create a GSN written report, ""Crime & Servitude"" and a video documentary, ""Bought & Sold."" The film was released in 1997 and received widespread media coverage in the US and abroad, including specials on ABC Primetime Live, CNN, and BBC.
The documentary also helped to catalyze legislative reform on trafficking as well as new financial resources to address the problem.Galster took what was learned during that undercover period and continues this work, founding the Freeland Foundation, which is the lead implementing partner of Asia's Regional Response to Endangered Species Trafficking (ARREST), a program sponsored by the U.S. government in partnership with ASEAN and over fifty governmental and non-governmental organizations.
The material that was collected during those two years is housed at the Human Rights Documentation Initiative (HRDI), The University of Texas at Austin


== United Nations Day of Tolerance ==
Beginning in 1985, Mitchell began an association with Irving Sarnoff, the executive director of Friends of the United Nations (FOTUN), and his co-founder, Dr. Noel Brown, Director of the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP), North America. The Friends of the United Nations is an NGO dedicated to advocating support for programs of the United Nations.As part of their work on international social issues Mitchell was asked to create a celebration for the United Nations International Day for Tolerance in 1999. The International Day for Tolerance is an annual observation declared by UNESCO in 1995 to generate public awareness of the dangers of intolerance.
Mitchell organized the 1999 event honoring Mikhail Gorbachev, former leader of the Soviet Union and Arnold Schwarzenegger, actor, politician and Chairman of the USC Schwarzenegger Institute of State and Global Policy. Keynote speakers included John Kerry, U.S. Senator and U.S. Secretary of State.


== Rural development ==
One of the first projects integrating agricultural development, sustainability, community and social values, and economic growth was in a region of Qingdao, China where his company, MCM Group, brought international blueberry agricultural experts to develop what is considered now one of the world's largest blueberry farms (The Qingdao Cangma Mountain Development). The project included hi-technology organic agriculture, agritourism, educational programs, local culture and residential development to provide the local rural community with a successful economic transition.

Sam Hide,"Sam Hide is a historic or apocryphal character in the folklore of New England, used in the folk saying ""to lie like Sam Hide"". There is no record of the death of a Sam Hide in the records of Dedham, Massachusetts though he is said to have died in 1732, however Sam Hide is noted at age 105 at Dedham as being a sachem, chief or sagamore who first and last were, to a greater or less degree, land-holders, and leaders of the multifarious tribes of New England.Hide was said to be a Native American, a great wit, and an infamous cider-drinker and liar. It has been speculated by James Wimer that Sam Hide may be a composite of several early anecdotes and stories.


== Tales ==
Numerous folk tales are told about Sam Hide; one such tale is that of Hide and a deer which illustrates his telling of lies or tall tales. In the story, Hide was in search of a glass of (hard) cider, so went to the house of a neighbor and offered, for the price of a crown (five shillings), to tell the man where he had shot and killed a deer. The man, wanting to find the deer meat, counter-offered half a crown, so Hide described a local meadow, then described a tree in that meadow, saying that the deer was to be found under that tree. The man went off to find the deer, but found none and returned home empty handed. Years later, he ran across Hide and accused him of trickery. Hide asked if the man would find it acceptable if an Indian told the truth half the time, and the man said he would. Hide then noted that he had told the truth about there being a meadow, and about there being a tree, just not about there being a deer beneath the tree, and concluded that he had told two truths to one lie, thus ending the matter.
George Lyman Kittredge recounts tales of Hide having faithfully served the English in wars against Indian tribes and earning himself the name of a brave soldier. In one story, Hide is said to have killed 19, of the enemy, and tried hard to make up the 20th, but was unable:

On July 3d, 1676, Major Talcott of Connecticut, who was pursuing King Philip in the Narragansett country, after surprising and defeating the enemy in a swamp, turned towards home, at the request of his Mohegan and Pequot allies.  On the way his troops fell in with a party of sixty Indians, 'all of whom they slew and took'.  One of the prisoners was a 'young sprightly fellow', whom his captors, the Mohegans, were allowed to put to death after their own savage fashion.  'And indeed', writes Hubbard, 'of all the enemies that have been subject of the precedent discourse; this villain did most deserve to become an object of justice and severity; for he boldly told them, that he had with his gun dispatched nineteen, and that he had charged it for the twentieth; but not meeting with any of ours, and unwilling to loose a fair shot, he had let fly at a Mohegan, and kill'd him; with which, having made up his number, he told them he was fully satisfied'.
The claim of the 19 enemy may have been from ""Hubbard's Indian Wars"", 1677 edition.

Felix Steiger,"Felix Steiger (born 18 July 1980) is a Swiss former sailor, who specialized in the two-person dinghy (470) class. Together with his partner Tobias Etter, he was named one of the country's top sailors in the double-handed dinghy for the 2008 Summer Olympics, finishing in a distant twenty-third place. Outside his Olympic career, he and Etter locked the podium spot with a bronze in the men's 470 at the 2005 Summer Universiade in İzmir, Turkey. Steiger trained most of his sporting career at Schloss Greifensee Sailing Club in the outskirts of Zürich.Steiger competed for the Swiss sailing squad, as a crew member in the men's 470 class, at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. He and skipper Etter topped the Swiss Sailing Federation's selection criteria for a coveted spot on the Olympic team, based on their cumulative scores attained in a series of international regattas, including their top 40 finish at the Worlds nearly eight months earlier in Melbourne, Australia. The Swiss duo successfully posted a triad of single-digit marks each in races 3, 5, and 9, but a random wave of substandard outcomes throughout the series pushed both Etter and Steiger to the middle of a 29-boat fleet, sitting them in twenty-third overall with 162 net points.

Pat Kelly (American football),"Patrick Joseph Kelly II (October 29, 1965 – March 28, 2003) was a National Football League (NFL) tight end who played for the Denver Broncos (1988–1989) and the New York Jets (1990–1991). He was drafted by the Broncos in the seventh round of the 1988 NFL Draft. He played in 44 games over 4 seasons, starting only the 1988 AFC Championship due to an injury to starter Clarence Kay. Kelly also played in Super Bowl XXIV. He died of cancer on March 28, 2003.


== Early years ==
Kelly attended R. L. Thomas High School in Webster, New York, before heading to Syracuse, New York to play with the Syracuse Orange football team. Head Coach Greg Robinson said of him, 
...There was Pat Kelly.  Pat Kelly – what a character.  This guy was as bright as they came.  He was at the Jets, and at the Broncos, went on and was doing a wonderful job on Wall Street.  Pat was the kind of guy who he could turn a locker room because of the way he could disrupt it with his sense of humor.  He could take over a whole football team.  He was a guy who everybody not only remembered as a player, but also as a person.  Sadly, we lost Pat not too long ago.  He is always remembered for what he was – a special person.
 Kelly also won the Zunic Award, which is given annually to anyone who exhibits the courage and spirit of Mike and Judy Zunic. More specifically, it usually signifies overcoming a severe injury.


== After football ==
After leaving the NFL, Kelly became a successful businessman. This led to him co-creating the Joshua Frase Foundation in the fall of 1996, a foundation devoted to raising funds for research into Centronuclear myopathy and related congenital myopathies, with friend and former Syracuse/New York Jets teammate Paul Frase. Frase's son Joshua, whom the foundation is named for, suffered from centronuclear myopathy and died on December 24, 2010, at the age of 15. Kelly also created the JFF Muscle Dream Team Gala and helped raise millions of dollars for the foundation.

Arthur Katz,"Arthur ""Art"" Katz (13 Feb 1929 Brooklyn, NY – 28 Jun 2007 Laporte, MN) was an American author and Christian preacher who traveled the world teaching an alternative to what he described as today's ""make nice"" Christianity. Born to Jewish parents, he became a self-proclaimed Marxist/atheist, and then was converted to Christianity while taking a year sabbatical from his Oakland, California, teaching job and traveling through Europe in 1963.


== Early life ==
Katz was born to Jewish parents and raised in Brooklyn, New York.  He attended Santa Monica City College, University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of California, Berkeley, earning B.A. and M.A. degrees in history and an M.A. degree in theology at Luther Seminary, Saint Paul, Minnesota.


== Conversion and ministry ==
In his book Ben Israel: Odyssey of a Modern Jew, Katz describes encounter after encounter with Christians who defied the stereotype he held, and, after reading a portion of the New Testament, added:

The law said that the woman must be stoned. Yet Jesus had been teaching forgiveness, and earlier in the Book had actually said, ""God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved."" Jesus was trapped.
... What would I say in Jesus' place? I searched my mind, exhausting my resources of logic and reason and finally conceded there was no answer. Fully expecting the worst, I reopened the book and read on. I found Jesus bending over, poking His finger in the dirt.
... And then came His answer, ""Let him who is without sin cast the first stone."" I gasped. A sword had been plunged deep into my own being. It was numbing and shocking, yet thrilling, because the answer was so utterly perfect. It defied cerebral examination. It cut across every major issue I had ever anguished upon in my life. Truth. Justice. Righteousness. Integrity. I knew that what I had read transcended human knowledge and comprehension. It had to be divine.''

Katz became a Christian shortly thereafter and married a Danish woman he met on the trip, Inger, with whom he raised three children. Katz made his mark as a preacher during the 1970s, appearing on such television programs as Kathryn Kuhlman's I Believe in Miracles. He continued preaching up until the year he died. During his early years, Katz preached against what he described as the lack of character, seriousness and proper motivations of Christians. He spent his later years talking about what he called the coming destruction and redemption of the Jewish people and their relationship with Christians.
Katz was a founder of the Ben Israel Fellowship in Laporte, Minnesota, in 1975 (ref. Ben Israel Newsletter Summer 1975) with this stated vision: ""a rugged discipleship training camp for end-time ministries (particularly to the Jewish people); a year-round convocation center for the preparation of God's people; a permanent community of committed believers out of which ministries will be nurtured and sent forth and finally, a refuge for entire Jewish families whom we expect to be swept into the Kingdom at a soon-coming time.""Except for a sabbatical from late 1985 to early 1987, Katz lived at Ben Israel (when he wasn't ministering worldwide) until his death in 2007 and hosted a summer-long ""prophet school"" where people from around the world would come, live together in a communal setting and learn from Katz and others about the prophetic life Katz believed Christians were called to.

Fritz Howard,"Formerly an FBI Special Agent, Fritz Howard, who is now Deputy Chief of the LAPD Special Operations Bureau, is a fictional character featured in the TNT programs The Closer and Major Crimes, and is portrayed by Jon Tenney. Fritz received his initial training at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia and has been working for the FBI in Los Angeles for the three years prior to Brenda Johnson's arrival in Los Angeles to become an LAPD Deputy Chief. Fritz is an old friend of Brenda's and has known her since at least her time in Washington, D.C.  Fritz and Brenda were married in the last episode of Season Four of The Closer. Fritz not only provides her with access to FBI resources and inside information when local resources are unavailable, he also provides emotional grounding for the passionate Brenda, who can get overly caught up in her investigations. He later continues to aid the Major Crimes Division (MCD) as their FBI liaison after Johnson leaves MCD and, during season 3 of Major Crimes, he retires from the FBI to become Deputy Chief of Special Operations Bureau, covering LAPD's SWAT, K-9, Air, Mounted and other special units.


== Character history ==
Extremely smart and well-liked, Howard has many law enforcement connections and knows how to track down information for criminal cases. He is a true gentleman.  Throughout The Closer, he would do practically anything for Brenda. He is also very patient and tolerates her work addiction; for example, he is willing to wait hours or even days for her to wrap up a case so that he can see her. When Brenda's mother came to town as the two were moving in together, Fritz suffered a charade for Brenda's sake, and kept all his possessions in a U-Haul trailer so her mother wouldn't find out. He is extremely kind, almost to a fault, when it comes to Brenda, and he is so supportive and loving to her that he might even overstep professional bounds and risk his career to help her with cases. He endures ribbing from his fellow agents as a result of the assistance he gives to the Major Crimes Division (MCD), formerly the Priority Homicide Division, the LAPD division headed by Brenda. In the third season Brenda learns that Fritz had two DUIs some years earlier, and is a recovering alcoholic. In Major Crimes, when asked if Howard was a bureaucrat or ""one of the good guys"", the squad stated he was one of the good guys and not so bad for an FBI agent.
Howard continues as FBI Liaison to the LAPD in the series Major Crimes.  In season 3, Assistant Chief of Operations Russell Taylor suggests Howard for the job of Deputy Chief of the Special Operations Bureau of the LAPD, pointing out that he is an excellent candidate whose 27 years with the FBI means that he could easily retire with his full pension and start a second career. After helping resolve a hostage situation, Howard ultimately accepts the job and spends his last days as an FBI agent helping solve a case, before officially taking up the job, However, Howard has a heart attack that he keeps secret from all but Tao, including his wife Brenda. This heart attack requires him to wear an external pacemaker.
During season 5, Deputy Chief Howard temporarily serves as Acting Assistant Chief of Operations, after Taylor is murdered. In this duty, Howard continues to work alongside the MCD while the LAPD works on a permanent replacement for Taylor. When Commander Leo Mason is promoted to Assistant Chief of Operations, Howard is able to resume his preferred role as Deputy Chief of the Special Operations Bureau. He is also aware of Sharon's impending promotion to the open Commander rank and congratulates her as the last person to call Sharon ""Captain"".

Charleston Air Force Base,"Charleston Air Force Base (IATA: CHS, ICAO: KCHS, FAA LID: CHS) is a United States military facility located in the City of North Charleston, South Carolina. The facility is under the jurisdiction of the United States Air Force's 628th Air Base Wing (628 ABW), a subordinate element of the Air Mobility Command (AMC). It is part of Joint Base Charleston, which combined Charleston Air Force Base with Naval Support Activity Charleston.


== Overview ==
A joint civil-military airport, Charleston Air Force Base today shares its runways with Charleston International Airport for commercial airline aircraft operations, and a commercial aircraft factory making Boeing aircraft, on the south side of the airfield and general aviation aircraft operations on the east side. The 437th Airlift Wing (437 AW) of the Air Mobility Command (AMC) and the 315th Airlift Wing (315 AW) of the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) operate the C-17A Globemaster III from the base. The installation has also in the past maintained an alert site for rotational Air Combat Command (ACC) and ACC-gained Air National Guard fighter-interceptor aircraft.


== Units ==
Charleston Air Force Base is home to the 628th Air Base Wing (628 ABW), the host wing for installation support. The 628 ABW's primary duties are to provide installation support to 53 DoD and Federal agencies, servicing a total force of over 79,000 airmen, sailors, soldiers, Marines, Coast Guardsmen, civilians, dependents and retirees on Charleston AFB and Naval Weapons Station Charleston. Additionally, they also provide expeditionary Airmen to combatant commanders in support of joint and combined operations.
The 437th Airlift Wing (437 AW) operates the C-17 Globemaster III strategic airlift aircraft in support of its mission to provide airlift of troops and passengers, military equipment, cargo, and aeromedical equipment and supplies worldwide in accordance with tasking by Air Mobility Command and unified combatant commanders.
The air base has four operational groups consisting of 21 squadrons and two wing staff directorates. It is augmented by a parallel, collocated Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) ""associate"" wing, the 315th Airlift Wing (315 AW), which shares the same C-17 aircraft with the 437 AW.
In addition, the USAF Auxiliary / Civil Air Patrol's Coastal Charleston Composite Squadron is also assigned to Charleston Field, utilizing the Charleston AFB Aero Club facility near the control tower.


== History ==


=== Air Force base ===
The history of Charleston Air Force Base began in 1919 when U.S. Army Colonel Herbert A. Dargue, then Chief of the Air Service (forerunner to the Federal Aviation Administration), visited the area looking for a suitable landing field for ""aeroplanes. Charles Lindbergh's nonstop solo crossing of the Atlantic Ocean in 1927 heightened city officials' interest to establish air operations in Charleston.
In 1928, the City of Charleston rented land and began operating a simple airfield about twelve miles north of city limits. Foreseeing a commercial future in air travel, the city formed the Charleston Aircraft Corporation to acquire the land for a municipal airport. In May 1931, the corporation purchased 432 acres (175 ha) for $25,000 from the South Carolina Mining and Manufacturing Company. Later in the year, the city acquired the airport facility for $60,000 and immediately began improvements.
During the 1930s, airport operations expanded to keep pace with advances in general and commercial aviation being experienced throughout the country. Despite the Great Depression, the Federal Government stepped in to assist the city with modernizing the airport. In 1935, the Works Progress Administration poured $313,000 into the airport. Workers paved one 3,500-foot-long runway (1,100 m) and constructed a second 3,000-foot one (910 m). The project also improved upon the existing lighting system with up-to-date field lighting.
Given the continuing growth in passenger aviation, Pan American Airways selected Charleston Airport as its western terminus for trans-Atlantic flights. Although this plan never came to fruition, it contributed to a burgeoning increase in traffic for the airport. As a result, the city purchased 300 more acres (120 ha) of land surrounding the airport for $300,000 in 1937 to accommodate additional service buildings and hangars.


==== World War II ====
In 1939, with world tensions heightening, the United States Army Air Corps began a massive buildup of troops, bases, and equipment in preparation for war. As a result, Charleston acquired more land in 1940 for additional airport improvements that included construction of a hangar and administration building and lengthening of the runways to 5,000 feet. Prior to the U.S. entering World War II, in 1941 the War Department allotted another $199,000 to the Charleston Airport for runway extension and other improvements needed for aircraft dispersal against attack
After the Pearl Harbor attack on 7 December 1941, the 56th Pursuit Group based at Charlotte Airport, North Carolina, and its 61st Pursuit Squadron arrived at the Charleston airport. The squadron's P-39 Airacobra and P-40 Warhawk aircraft provided coastal defense operations for the Southern Defense Command, Third Air Force, Carolina Sector. Arriving later that month, the 67th Observation Group, 107th Observation Squadron and the Federalized 105 Observation Squadron (Tennessee National Guard) provided antisubmarine patrols along the east coast with North American O-47 and Stinson O-49 Vigilant observation aircraft.
On 11 December the War Department assumed de facto control of Charleston Municipal Airport yet allowed Delta and Eastern commercial airlines to continue their civilian operations. Although Air Corps personnel had operated from the airport since the war began, true occupancy did not take place until 23 March 1942 when the city of Charleston and the War Department signed a lease and formally activated the installation.
Effective 1 April 1942, the base was assigned to Air Service Command and 29th Air Base Group, Distribution Point No. 2 became the first host unit responsible for building, maintaining and operating the installation infrastructure. On 9 June that same year, the base transferred to First Air Force and was officially named Charleston Army Air Base on 22 October 1942. The installation transferred back to Air Service Command in December 1942, then moved back to First Air Force in September 1943 where it remained until the end of the war. At the same time as the base struggled to find its niche, the 16th Antisubmarine Squadron operated B-34 Lexington bombers helping defend the eastern seaboard from possible attack.
On 31 March 1944, Johns Island Army Airfield became an auxiliary of Charleston AAB, providing an emergency landing field for the base.
Renamed Charleston Army Air Field on 15 June 1943, initially the base served mainly as an air depot training station, providing the final phase of training to service groups and air depot groups departing home for the war overseas. Concurrent with its reassignment to First Air Force, in September 1943 the base changed missions. Now it would give the final phase of training to B-24 Liberator crews. The 454th Bombardment Group arrived in September and left Charleston for the European Theater of Operations in December 1943. This same month the 400th Bombardment Group arrived, but this organization was to function as a replacement training unit rather than an operational training unit.
On 10 April 1944, the 113th Army Air Field Base Unit (CCTS-H) activated and took over as Charleston's host unit. But the need for B-24 crews ended with Germany's defeat and end of the war in Europe. In their place, however, the Army Air Force required a large number of transport crews. Consequently, the base was transferred to Air Transport Command on 1 June 1945 and began C-54 Skymaster crew training that lasted until late August 1945.
Only a few months after the Japanese surrender, on 25 April 1946 the government placed the base in surplus status as part of the massive postwar draw down. The city of Charleston requested that the field, which originally had been leased to the U.S. Army for $1 per year, be returned to the municipality. By this time, the field consisted of 2,050 acres (830 ha) with more than $12 million worth of facilities and improvements. Despite not being official returned to the city until 19 October 1948, the city council voted to construct a new air terminal in 1947, and commercial air operations resumed on a full-time basis at the now fully civilian airport.


==== Cold War ====
As a result of the Cold War, the now independent United States Air Force requesting funds from Congress to begin troop carrier operations at the Charleston airport. By August 1951, Congress approved a $28 million public works improvement package, and during the remainder of the year, preliminary work was underway to construct facilities for a troop carrier wing. In March 1952, the city of Charleston signed a lease agreement with the Air Force for joint use of the airport. For $1 per year the lease allowed the U.S. Air Force to occupy all properties south and west of the Southern Railway's tracks while the city retained terminal buildings, hangars, and other buildings along the north and east boundaries of the airport. Construction of base facilities, meanwhile, began in May 1952.
By early 1953, elements of the 456th Troop Carrier Wing, assigned to Tactical Air Command, arrived at Charleston to prepare the base for operational status. On 1 June 1953, the base received its current name of Charleston Air Force Base and activated on 1 August. Two weeks later, on 15 August 1953, the arrival of 50 C-119 Flying Boxcars effectively made the base operational. Although numerous construction projects were still underway, the wing held a dedication ceremony on 13 November 1953 to open the base officially.


==== Worldwide airlift ====
With the 456th already in place, advance elements of the newly activated 1608th Air Transport Group, assigned to Military Air Transport Command (later, Military Airlift Command), first arrived in February 1954 to establish operations. One month later on 4 March 1954, the group received its first C-54 Skymaster transport. As the 1608th increased in size, MATS and TAC negotiated ownership of the base. Eventually, on 1 March 1955, Charleston AFB came under the jurisdiction and control of MATS and the 1608th Air Transport Wing (Medium) became the base's host unit. Also upon assignment to MATS, the base became the terminus for all C-54 airlift to Europe and the Near East.
On 16 February 1954, Air Defense Command established the 444th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron as a tenant unit on Charleston flying F-86D Sabre fighter aircraft as the east coast's air defense against airborne invaders. Soon after, the base achieved permanent status and with that declaration MATS began various facility construction projects to further improve upon the base's status. Meanwhile, the 1608th received its first C-121C Constellation appropriately named ""City of Charleston"" on 16 September 1955 (tail number 54-153). Shortly thereafter the base was designated as an aerial port of embarkation, giving Charleston AFB more prominent role in MATS. Tactical Air Command and the 456th left Charleston on 16 October 1955, which also ended the base's association with the C-119 Flying Boxcars.
Charleston AFB underwent a significant change on 18 June 1958 when the 1608th received its first C-124C Globemaster aircraft, then again a month later when it lost its last C-54 transports. The 444th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron's aircraft changed as well. In February 1960, it began operating F-101 Voodoo aircraft and lost its F-86Ds.
The next big change came in 1962. The Air Force decided to retire the C-121 fleet and sent the 1608th its first replacement C-130 Hercules on 16 August 1962. The last C-121 Connie left Charleston AFB on 9 February 1963. Only two years later, on 14 August 1965, the wing received its first C-141 Starlifter, the newest airlifter in the Air Force inventory. But, unlike the previous aircraft changes, the arrival of this new aircraft meant a change in host units.
On 8 January 1966, the 437th Military Airlift Wing took over as Charleston AFB's host unit. Although the 1608th inactivated and the 437th activated its place, it appeared that every unit with a ""1608"" in its name simply changed it to ""437."" All of the 1608th's people, aircraft, buildings, etc. became the 437th's. The operational history of Charleston AFB is now inextricably tied to the 437th Airlift Wing's history.
Soon after the wing's arrival, on 30 September 1968 the 444th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron inactivated, ending Charleston AFB's long-standing association with air defense and fighter aircraft. In September 1969, the Air Force Reserve Command's 943d Military Airlift Group activated at Charleston AFB making it the first associate unit in the southeastern United States. On 1 July 1973, the 315th Military Airlift Wing (Associate) activated and replaced the 943d as the 437th's associate Reserve wing, similar to how the 437th replaced the 1608th a few years earlier.


==== From the 1990s ====
In 1992, following the disestablishment of MAC as part of an Air Force-wide reorganization, the 437th Military Airlift Wing (437 MAW) was placed under the newly established Air Mobility Command (AMC) and redesignated as the 437th Airlift Wing (437 AW) and 315th Airlift Wing (315 AW), respectively.
Today, the 437 AW and 315 AW (Associate) operate the C-17 Globemaster III. The base has also maintained an alert site for fighter-interceptor aircraft (primarily Air National Guard aircraft) of Tactical Air Command (TAC) and Air Combat Command (ACC), conducting the continental air defense mission. The last unit to occupy the alert site was a detachment of F-16 aircraft from the 158th Fighter Wing of the Vermont Air National Guard. Detachment operations officially ended at the end of FY99, with the facility placed in caretaker status. However, since 11 September 2001, the facility has seen intermittent operations by various USAF fighter aircraft of the Active and Reserve Components resuming the continental air defense mission under the cognizance of United States Northern Command and NORAD. In FY 2014-2015 the alert site and associated hangar were demolished.

An Air Force Times article dated 21 December 2009 announced the activation of the 628th Air Wing to ""take over administrative duties for a number of military commands"" in January 2010. The 628th ""will essentially serve as the 'landlord' for Charleston Air Force Base, the Charleston Naval Consolidated Brig and about 50 other military commands. The unit will handle items such as building and grounds services, supply and civil engineering and public works.After nearly a year of much needed work, runway 03/21 at Joint Base Charleston reopened on 25 February 2010. The $30 million project to rebuild the deteriorating runway began 9 April 2009. Its completion was marked with the first take off and landing of a Charleston C-17. The runway now has newly paved asphalt overruns, and 25-foot-wide (7.6 m) asphalt-paved shoulders, both of which the runway lacked. The runway also has new edge lighting, distance remaining markers and runway end indicator lights on both ends.
Because of that construction, larger and heavier aircraft were cleared to land on runway 03/21, which was key when work scheduled for Fiscal Year 2012 began on runway 15/33, the base's main runway. The last major work done on Joint Base Charleston runways was in 1968.
The Joint Base Charleston Passenger Terminal reopened in their new facility on November 21, 2022, after undergoing renovations that began in 2018. Construction was briefly halted in 2019 after the damaging effects of Hurricane Dorian, the category 5 Atlantic hurricane, which made landfall on September 5, 2019.

James Cocker & Sons,"James Cocker and Sons  is a nursery business located in Aberdeen, Scotland. Founded in 1841 (1841) by James Cocker, the company has been owned by the Cocker family for five generations. During the last seventy years, the nursery has introduced more than 100 new rose varieties and holds Royal Warrants from Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, and the Prince of Wales. James Cocker & Sons is best known for creating the hybrid tea rose, 'Silver Jubilee', the popular rose named in honour of the Queen's 25 years reign. The rose was developed by Alec Cocker, and introduced by his wife, Anne Cocker, after Alec's death in 1977. Anne continued to breed roses and manage the company until she was in her eighties. She won multiple horticultural awards and was internationally recognized for her work.


== History ==


=== 1841 to 1929 ===
James Cocker & Sons was founded by James Cocker (1807-1880) in 1841 in Aberdeen, Scotland.  Cocker established the nursery after he left his job as head gardener at Castle Fraser. Cocker originally sold forest trees and herbaceous plants. He later acquired additional property nearby and set up a seed warehouse on Union Street, in Aberdeen. Cocker's son, James (1832-1897), took over the company when his father died in 1880.Cocker's three sons, William, James and Alexander, joined the company in the 1880s. With the growing popularity of roses, the Cockers initiated a rose breeding program in the  early 1890s. After Cocker died in 1897, his three sons took over the management of the company. The nursery's initial rose introductions in 1892, were two sports out of the Hybrid perpetuals, 'Duke of Fife' and 'Duchess of Fife'. The nursery's first commercially successful rose variety was 'Mrs. Cocker' (1899). Alexander became the sole owner of the company after the deaths of his two brothers. Alexander Cocker died in 1920 and the company was put into a trust for his two young children, Margaret and Alexander Morison (Alec) (1907-1977). The nursery was closed in 1923.


=== 1930 to 1977 ===
Alec Cocker reopened the business as a general nursery in 1936. He rented a field in Aberdeen and initially grew perennials and roses. During the Second World War, Cocker joined the Civil Defence Service, where he met Anne Rennie (1920-2014). Cocker and Anne became engaged, and after the war formed a new nursery business using Anne's £80 war grant. The young couple delayed their marriage until 1952, waiting until their new company was thriving. Cocker and Anne expanded their business in 1959, when they bought a larger property on the outskirts of Aberdeen.The Cockers began specialising in breeding new rose varieties in the 1960s. Their first rose varieties include, 'Morning Jewel' (1968), 'Rosy Mantle' (1968) and 'White Cockade' (1969). The hybrid tea, 'Alec's Red' (1970), was awarded the Royal National Rose Society's (RNRS) President's International Trophy in 1970. In 1976, Cocker was granted a Royal Warrant by the Queen. Cocker's' most celebrated rose variety, an apricot blend hybrid tea, 'Silver Jubilee', was named with permission of the Queen to celebrate her 25-year reign. Cocker died of a heart attack in 1977 and did not live to see his rose's success.


=== 1978 to 2020 ===
Anne introduced 'Silver Jubilee' in 1978, the year after Cocker's death. She continued to manage the nursery, and later expanded the business. She was granted Cocker's Royal Warrant as supplier to the Queen of bare root roses. She managed the rose breeding program at the company, creating new rose varieties well into her eighties.
Anne gained an international reputation for her outstanding rose varieties including, 'Remember Me' (1979), 'Braveheart' (1993),  and 'Heart of Gold' (2001). Cocker specialised in unusually coloured and patterned rose varieties. In 1995, the Royal Caledonian Horticultural Society awarded Cocker the Scottish Horticultural Medal for outstanding services to Scottish horticulture. In 1999, Cocker was the recipient of the  RNRS's most prestigious award, the Dean Hole Medal. In 2001 she was awarded The Queen Mother's Royal Warrant,  thought to be the last Royal Warrant granted by the Queen Mother.Anne died in 2014, at the age of 94. Her son, Alec Cocker Jr. and his wife, Leanne, are the current owners of the family rose business. He was awarded the Royal Warrant from Prince of Wales in 2018.

Lutf Allah (Sarbadar),"Lutf Allah (d. c. 1357/58) was the leader of the Sarbadars of Sabzewar from 1356 until his death.


== Life ==
Lutf Allah was the son of Wajih ad-Din Mas'ud, the second leader of the Sarbadars, and was considered by Mas'ud's adherents to be his legitimate successor. By the reign of Yahya Karawi he had come of age and Mas'ud's supporters were ready to install him as head of state. After the murder of Yahya in c. 1355 they attempted to seize control of the government. They were prevented from doing so by Haidar Qassāb, who drove them from Sabzewar and killed many of them. The remaining members of Mas'ud's party fled to Esfarayen, where Lutf Allah's atabeg Nasr Allah rebelled against the central government. The situation for Lutf Allah improved when Haidar Qassib was murdered on the orders of Hasan Damghani. Hasan then had Lutf Allah proclaimed as formal sovereign of the Sarbadars.
Lutf Allah's reign was short and consisted mostly of him acting as a figurehead for Hasan Damghani. During this time Astarabad was lost to Amir Vali. After a few years Lutf Allah got into a disagreement with Hasan Damghani, who deposed and executed him and then took formal control of the state. With Lutf Allah's death the party of Mas'ud was mostly broken.

AllMusic reviewer Scott Yanow stated ""Although Ferguson gets to throw in some high-register blasts now and then, his orchestra is mostly used as a prop behind Connor.

Samuel Read Hall,"Samuel Read Hall (October 27, 1795 – June 24, 1877) was an American educator.


== Life ==
He was born in Croydon, New Hampshire, the son of a clergyman. When he was three years old, his family moved to Guildhall, Vermont. Samuel was home-schooled and never attended a college. In 1814, he was employed as a teacher in Rumford, Maine. He studied to become a minister in Meriden, New Hampshire, and gained his license in 1823. He became the principal at an academy in Fitchburg, Massachusetts in 1822.

Showdown cooperative learning,"Showdown is a cooperative learning technique that allows students to work in a group. It is usually used in middle school classrooms.


== Process ==
Students in groups of three or four receive a task card with specific problems from the chapter they are learning about.
The team leader of the group picks up the card and reads the sentence on it aloud without showing it to the others.
Other team members write the answers on their paper or chalkboards. When the teacher gives the showdown signal, all the members reveal their responses at once.
If everyone gets the same answer they can assume the answer is correct. If not, all members need to discuss to see if someone did something wrong and help that student to see what they did wrong.
For the next task card, a different student on the team becomes the leader.
The teacher monitors the activity to make sure students are getting the correct answers.


== Advantages claimed for Showdown ==
It gives opportunity to the individual to expertise their ideas.
It is easy to perform in a class as it takes less time.

The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run,"The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run is a 2020 American live-action/animated adventure comedy film based on the animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants. Written and directed by series co-developer and former writer Tim Hill, who co-wrote the story with Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger, It is the third theatrical film based on the series, following the first in 2004 and second in 2015, and the first film in the franchise to be fully animated in stylized computer-generated imagery (as opposed to being entirely animated in 2D like the first film, or mixing 2D and CGI animation together like in the second film). The regular voice cast of the series reprise their respective roles from the series and the previous films and including new characters (both live-action and animated) performed by Awkwafina, Snoop Dogg, Tiffany Haddish, Keanu Reeves, Danny Trejo, and Reggie Watts. The film follows the origin of how SpongeBob met Gary the Snail, and SpongeBob's quest to rescue his pet after he is kidnapped. The film is dedicated to creator Stephen Hillenburg, who died in 2018, and also served as an executive producer on the project.
Development for a third SpongeBob film began in April 2015, two months after the release of Sponge Out of Water. By January 2016, Aibel and Berger had been hired to write the film, and by April 2018, Hill was onboard as director. Hans Zimmer composed the film's musical score. 
The film was produced by Paramount Animation, Nickelodeon Movies, and United Plankton Pictures, with animation provided by Mikros Image. Originally slated for a worldwide theatrical release by Paramount Pictures, plans were changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was released theatrically in Canada on August 14, 2020, and digitally on Netflix in other territories on November 5, 2020. It was released as a premium video-on-demand offering and a Paramount+ launch title in the United States on March 4, 2021. Sponge on the Run received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the animation and loyalty to the series. The film was nominated for Favorite Animated Movie at the 2022 Kids' Choice Awards, but lost to Encanto. A fourth film, The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants, is currently in development with a release date of December 19, 2025.


== Plot ==
In Bikini Bottom, Plankton works on a new plan to steal the Krabby Patty formula while Karen argues that SpongeBob is actually responsible for all his previous failures and not Mr. Krabs. Meanwhile, in Atlantic City, selfish ruler King Poseidon uses up all the slime from his latest sea snail, which is necessary to maintain his appearance. Poseidon decrees the obtaining of a new snail, and Plankton kidnaps SpongeBob's pet snail Gary so that SpongeBob will no longer interfere with his plans. The next morning, SpongeBob learns from Patrick that Gary was taken to Atlantic City. As part of his plan, Plankton offers Otto, a robot built by Sandy, to take them to the city with the hopes that they never return. Without SpongeBob cooking Krabby Patties, the Krusty Krab's enraged customers trash the restaurant despite Mr. Krabs and Squidward's efforts to stop them. 
Otto drives SpongeBob and Patrick to an old Western town where they meet a tumbleweed spirit named Sage. Sage reveals to SpongeBob and Patrick that they are dreaming, and must overcome a special mission to continue their search. He gives them a ""Challenge Coin"" that will give them bravery to enter into a tavern haunted by ghostly zombie pirates. SpongeBob and Patrick discover that the pirates' souls are trapped by an evil spirit known as ""El Diablo"", and decide to help free them. Diablo traps the duo in his office, where they accidentally disintegrate him. The pirates' souls are freed, and SpongeBob and Patrick are woken up by Otto.
Now accompanied by Sage, SpongeBob discovers that as soon as Gary's slime runs out, Poseidon will have him enslaved with the rest of his previous snails. Arriving at Atlantic City, Sage warns the pair not to be distracted by the city's attractions, but they ignore his warnings. After a fun-filled night, SpongeBob and Patrick discover that they have lost the ""Challenge Coin"" that allowed them to be brave, but they nonetheless enter Poseidon's palace. When they try to take Gary, both are arrested and imprisoned in the dungeon.
Back in Bikini Bottom, Plankton arrives at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs willingly gives him the formula, feeling depressed without SpongeBob. However, seeing Mr. Krabs so upset makes Plankton feel guilty about what he has done. Upon finding out that SpongeBob and Patrick will be executed in a luxury show in Poseidon's palace, Mr. Krabs, Squidward, Sandy, and a redeemed Plankton decide to save them.
In prison, Sage reveals to SpongeBob and Patrick that the ""Challenge Coin"" never had powers and that the bravery came from themselves. Before SpongeBob can be executed, Mr. Krabs, Squidward, Plankton, and Sandy burst into the show to testify in favor of SpongeBob. Along with Patrick, each recounts an experience they had with SpongeBob at a summer camp, earning the audience's gratitude. Afterwards, the group perform a musical number to distract Poseidon and take Gary. Poseidon realizes the distraction and orders his guards to capture the group. SpongeBob and his friends manage to escape the guards and head towards the exit, but are once again cornered when Otto leaves them behind.
Poseidon offers to drop charges against the group on the condition that SpongeBob leaves Gary with him. SpongeBob refuses, arguing that his friends decided to rescue him even if they risked death. When Poseidon finds out that he has no friends and reveals that he needs the slime for his appearance, SpongeBob offers to be his friend. Poseidon removes all his arrangements and return to his true appearance. Everyone accepts his appearance, and Poseidon allows SpongeBob to take Gary back home. Poseidon releases all his enslaved snails to accompany them and Bikini Bottom ends up becoming a ""sea snail refuge"".

== Reception ==


=== Box office ===
In the film's debut Canadian weekend, it grossed $865,824 from 300 theaters. Since Canada's grosses are factored into American totals, Sponge on the Run finished first at the box office, and had the highest weekend total for a film since the start of the pandemic.

In its second weekend, despite being added to an additional 26 theaters, the film dropped 36% to $550,000, finishing second behind Unhinged. In its third weekend the film made $400,000 from 314 theaters, then $345,000 in its fourth weekend, for a month-long running total of $3.6 million.


=== VOD rentals ===

=== Critical response ===
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 67% of 72 critics have given the film a positive review, with an average rating of 6.1/10. The site's critics consensus reads, ""Although its story may leave fans on the surface, The Spongebob Movie: Sponge on the Run is a wondrously wacky visit to Bikini Bottom that retains the charm of the original series."" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100 based on reviews from 20 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"".Writing for IndieWire, David Ehrlich gave the film a grade of B− and said, ""Even the weakest bits get by on good vibes and meta-cleverness ([Keanu] Reeves has become something of a human meme in recent years, but Sponge on the Run milks the actor's brand for a number of solid laughs), and the animation is detailed and inventive enough for the whole film to feel drenched in SpongeBob's demented energy."" Writing for CTV News, Richard Crouse gave the film 3.5 stars and wrote: ""Sponge on the Run brings with it the usual anarchy, inside jokes and unexpected celebrity cameos, but at its little osmotic heart is SpongeBob, a character who belongs to the same genus of entertainers as Soupy Sales, Stan Laurel and Pee-wee Herman."" The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney called the film ""fast, fun, [and] demented"" and wrote: ""The technological overhaul from 2D doesn't diminish the vibrant personalities of the character animation, and it's added an even trippier dimension to the surreal backgrounds. More immersive, if you will, even if its episodic action gets no prizes for storytelling discipline.""Aparita Bhandari of The Globe and Mail gave the film 1.5 out of 4 stars, writing: ""I totally understand if the latest SpongeBob SquarePants movie spinoff will draw in longtime fans and new audiences brave enough to venture into a movie theatre this Friday... However, for me and my two kids (aged 10 and 8), this dive into the deep sea wasn't as thrilling an adventure as we'd hoped for.""


=== Accolades ===
At the 19th Visual Effects Society Awards the special effects team was nominated in the category ""Outstanding Animated Character in an Animated Feature"".The film was nominated for four Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards in 2022, one for Favorite Animated Movie and three for Favorite Voice in an Animated Movie: Tom Kenny as SpongeBob, Awkwafina as Otto, and Keanu Reeves as Sage.

Forest Products Commission,"The Forest Products Commission (FPC) is a Western Australian Government trading enterprise established under an Act of Parliament, responsible for the development and marketing of the state's renewable timber resources.

The minister responsible for the agency is the Minister for Forestry, currently Jackie Jarvis  of the Labor Party. (https://www.wa.gov.au/government/premier-and-cabinet-ministers/jackie-jarvis)
Prior to the establishment of the commission, commercial logging and harvesting, as well as sharefarming, was undertaken by the then-Department of Conservation and Land Management. Its creation meant the conservation and commercial interests of the state, in respect of forestry, were separated and therefore removed a perceived conflict of interest.As part of its operations, the Forest Products Commission operates a commercial nursery and seed technologies facility at West Manjimup.The commission undertakes its operations in accordance with ISO 14001:2004, the Australian Forestry Standard (AS4708:2013 – Australian Standard for Sustainable Forest Management) and PEFC Chain of Custody of Forest and Tree-Based Products (Program for the Endorsement of Forest Certification ST 2002). These are an integral part of the commission's forest management policy, which states: ""The Forest Products Commission (FPC) is committed to ensuring Western Australia's renewable timber resources are managed sustainably through the implementation of forest management practices that are environmentally sound, socially acceptable and economically viable."" (https://www.wa.gov.au/government/publications/fpc-policy-9-forest-management)


== General manager ==
When the agency was established in November 2000, Dr Paul Biggs was appointed general manager. The general manager is now Stuart West.
The former Minister for Forestry, Hon. Terry Redman , noted in the media release announcing Dr Biggs' departure that his contribution to the industry was both appreciated and respected across Australia.
Through his role at the FPC, Paul has been dedicated to strengthening the industry and the regional communities it supports while maintaining a strong focus on good environmental management. I wish him well in his future endeavours.


== Protection of native forests ==
In 2021, the State Government announced it would stop the logging of native forests from 2024 onwards. Any native timber harvested after that time will only be for forest management activities, such as ecological thinning for forest health, road and track maintenance, and clearing to conduct approved mining operations. As a result, the Forest Products Commission's focus will shift to sustainable timber plantations.

The main seedling products include maritime pine (Pinus pinaster), radiata pine (Pinus radiata) and karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor). Seed cleaning and treatment services are available to increase seed viability.
The centre, which produces more than 14 million seedlings each year, was a back-to-back winner of the Western Australian Nursery and Garden Industry Award for Best Large Production Nursery in 2006 and 2007.

Flag of West Virginia,"The flag of West Virginia is the official flag of the U.S. State of West Virginia and was officially adopted by the West Virginia Legislature on March 7, 1929. The present flag consists of a pure white field bordered by a blue stripe with the coat of arms of West Virginia in the center, wreathed by Rhododendron maximum and topped by an unfurled red ribbon reading, ""State of West Virginia."" It is the only state flag to bear crossing rifles, meant to illustrate the importance of the state's fight for liberty during the Civil War as the southern unionist 35th state.The first flags to represent West Virginia following statehood were battle flags utilized by West Virginia regiments during the American Civil War. West Virginia's first official state flag was adopted in 1905, based upon the flag designed and used by the West Virginia State Commission at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in 1904. This flag was altered in 1907 for the Jamestown Exposition and featured the coat of arms on the obverse and a sprig of Rhododendron maximum on the reverse. In order to reproduce the flag more inexpensively, the West Virginia Legislature ratified the current flag with the state's coat of arms integrated with the rhododendron, which appears on both the obverse and the reverse. The ""Pledge of Allegiance to the West Virginia State Flag"" was unanimously adopted by the office of the Secretary of State of West Virginia in 1977.


== Design ==
The current state flag of West Virginia consists of a pure white field bordered on four sides by a stripe of blue. The white of the field symbolizes purity, while the blue border represents the Union. The center of the state flag is emblazoned with the state's coat of arms, a stylized version of the Great Seal of West Virginia. The lower half of the state flag is wreathed by two tethered swags of Rhododendron maximum, the state flower of West Virginia. Across the top of the state flag is an unfurled red ribbon with the constitutional designation ""State of West Virginia"", and across the bottom of the state flag is a tied red ribbon with the state's Latin motto Montani Semper Liberi (English: ""mountaineers are always free"").The state's coat of arms in the center of the flag symbolizes the principal pursuits and resources of West Virginia. In the center is an ivy-draped boulder that has been inscribed ""June 20, 1863,"" the date of West Virginia's admission to the Union as a state. In front of the boulder lie two crossed hunting rifles and a Phrygian cap (or ""Cap of Liberty"") to illustrate the importance of the state's fight for liberty. Two men, a farmer and a miner, stand on either side of the boulder and represent agriculture and industry. The farmer stands on the left with an ax and plow before a cornstalk and a sheaf of wheat. The miner stands on the right with a pickaxe and, behind him, two barrels, an anvil and sledge hammer.The state flag's proportions are identical to those of the flag of the United States. When utilized for parade purposes, all but the staff side of the state flag are to be trimmed with gold fringe. When used concurrently with the flag of the United States during ceremonial occasions, the state flag is trimmed and mounted like the United States flag with regard to fringe, cord, tassels, and mounting.


== History ==
Prior to the adoption of the current state flag of West Virginia, the state had been represented by a number of flags since attaining statehood in 1863, all of which proved impractical. The first West Virginia Legislature commissioned Joseph H. Diss Debar of Doddridge County to design the Great Seal of West Virginia in 1863. On September 26, 1863, the West Virginia Legislature officially adopted the seal designed by Diss Debar, a stylized version of which was also designated the state's coat of arms. Despite the adoption of an official seal, the state did not decide upon an official state flag until 1905.


=== American Civil War ===

Prior to West Virginia's separation from Virginia on June 20, 1863, pro-Union supporters in western Virginia created unique flags to show their support for the Union cause. In January 1861, the residents of Kingwood erected a flagpole measuring about 105 feet (32 m) in height, and on it they hoisted a handmade streamer with the word ""UNION"" prior to Virginia's secession. During the war, western Virginia regiments in the Union Army carried flags handmade by supportive women, as was the case with the Fifth Regiment Virginia Volunteer Infantry who carried a flag bearing the legend ""5th Va. Regiment"" in 1861.
In January 1864, the West Virginia Legislature approved a flag for the Fourth Regiment West Virginia Volunteer Infantry to acknowledge the regiment's battles at Charleston, Vicksburg, Jackson, and Missionary Ridge, all four of which were listed on the flag. This was the first among many battle flags to represent West Virginia after statehood which were utilized by soldiers of West Virginia regiments throughout the war. State battle flags were presented to each of West Virginia's Union regiments during the course of the war. These early state flags were squares of silk cloth measuring 6 feet (1.8 m), and were dark blue and trimmed with golden fringe. The obverse side of these flags were painted with the state's newly minted seal within an oval, along with the name of the respective West Virginia regiment and the names and dates of the battles in which they had participated. On the reverse side, the United States national emblem was painted and consisted of a bald eagle with its wings outstretched, clutching a bundle of 13 arrows in its right talon and an olive branch in its left, and a tricolor shield placed across its breast. In its beak, the eagle clutched a scroll with the national Latin motto E pluribus unum (English: ""Out of Many, One""). Following the conclusion of the American Civil War, the state of West Virginia had no official flag, and the matter was not taken up until the early 20th century.


=== 1905 flag ===
The need for and official state flag arose in 1904 when the West Virginia State Commission to the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis reported that the state required a flag or ensign to represent and distinguish itself among the other U.S. states at the exposition. In lieu of an official state flag, the commission adopted and used a state flag of its own design at the West Virginia building at the exposition, which was a ""sprig of mountain laurel upon an immaculate white field with a pale blue border"".In its report to the West Virginia Legislature, the West Virginia State Commission recommended the adoption of their flag design as the official state flag. On February 24, 1905, the West Virginia Legislature ratified the commission's flag design following its passage of Joint Resolution Number 16 during the gubernatorial administration of Albert B. White. The legislature adopted the commission's flag design, with the addition of a fringe or border of carmine red. The state flag was approved by the legislature to be employed on occasions where a special display of the state's individuality was necessary or regarded as appropriate. According to the 1905 joint resolution:
Said state flag shall be in length and breadth in the proportion of nine to thirteen, this being the same as the flag of the great American Republic of which West Virginia forms a part; the field thereof shall be pure white, upon the center of which shall be a sprig of the rhododendron maximum or ""big laurel,"" having flowers and leaves; and on the reverse side shall be the state coat-of-arms and the motto; the field of pure white shall be bordered by a band or strip of blue, and this in turn shall be bordered by a strip of fringe of carmine red; and said flag shall be regarded and used as the West Virginia state flag on all occasions where a special display of the state's individuality shall become necessary, or be regarded as appropriate.
Following its formal adoption by the legislature, schools and other institutions throughout West Virginia began flying the new state flag. The teachers and students at the schools in Ronceverte purchased the new state flag in June 1906, which measured 5.5 feet (1.7 m) in length, and used it along with the United States flag for salutes and patriotic exercises.


=== 1907 flag ===
By 1907, the West Virginia Legislature found the 1905 state flag design to be completely unfeasible due to the lettering on one side reading toward the staff, and the differing colors on each respective side showing through the opposite side of the flag's white field of cloth. The state legislature found that this destroyed ""the distinctive features of the banner and leaving the state without a prescribed official flag"". The West Virginia Legislature sought to remedy the state flag's design flaws in 1907 so that the state could be properly represented at the Jamestown Exposition in Norfolk. On February 25, 1907, during the administration of Governor William M. O. Dawson, the West Virginia Legislature passed Joint Resolution 2, which amended the flag by removing the seal and motto from the reverse side and changing the color of the bordering fringe from carmine red to old gold. Instead of the seal and motto, the reverse of the flag was changed to consist of ""a spring or sprig of the rhododendron maximum"". According to the 1907 joint resolution:
Said state flag shall be in length and breadth in proportion the same as the flag of the great American Republic of which West Virginia forms a part; the field thereof shall be pure white, upon the center of which on the observe side shall be the great seal or coat of arms of the state, beneath which shall appear the legend ""State of West Virginia,"" in a scroll; on the reverse side shall appear a sprig or sprigs of the rhododendron maximum, or big laurel, our state flower, having blossoms and leaves; the field of pure white shall be bordered by a band or strip of blue, and this in turn shall be bordered by a strip or fringe of old gold; and said flag shall be regarded and used as the West Virginia state flag on all occasions where a special display of the state's individuality shall become necessary, or be regarded as appropriate.


=== 1929 flag ===
The flag design ratified in 1907 remained the state's official flag until 1929. The state of West Virginia sought a flag design that could be produced inexpensively so that the state flag could be mass-produced for the state's public schools. The 1907 flag proved to be more costly to reproduce due to the two different symbols on each side of the banner, the state's coat of arms on the obverse and the state's flower on the reverse. The West Virginia Legislature decided the state flag should be stamped with a design that would integrate both the coat of arms and the state flower on both sides. The design of the present state flag was officially adopted by the West Virginia Legislature on March 7, 1929, by West Virginia Senate Joint Resolution Number 18. According to the joint resolution:
The proportions of the flag of the State of West Virginia shall be the same as those of the United States ensign; the field shall be pure white, upon the center of which shall be emblazoned in proper colors, the coat-of arms of the State of West Virginia upon which appears the date of the admission of the State into the Union, also with the motto, ""Montani Semper Liberi"" (Mountaineers Are Always Free). Above the coat-of-arms of the State of West Virginia there shall be a ribbon lettered, ""State of West Virginia,"" and arranged appropriately around the lower part of the coat-of-arms of the State of West Virginia a wreath of Rhododendron maximum in proper colors. The field of pure white shall be bordered by a strip of blue on four sides. The flag of the State of West Virginia when used for parade purposes shall be trimmed with gold colored fringe on three sides and when used on ceremonial occasions with the United States ensign, shall be trimmed and mounted in similar fashion to the United States flag as regards fringe, cord, tassels, and mounting.
In 2001, the North American Vexillological Association surveyed its members and other flag enthusiasts on the designs of the 72 U.S. state, U.S. territorial, and Canadian provincial flags. Members ranked the West Virginia state flag at 51 out of the 72 flags surveyed. U.S. state flags with state seals on solid-color fields, like the West Virginia state flag, proved unpopular in the survey.


== Usage and protocol ==

The West Virginia Legislature has passed a series of laws in the West Virginia Code governing the usage of the West Virginia state flag. The state flag is not permitted to be placed above, or if on the same level, to the right of the United States flag. Both the United States and West Virginia state flags are to be flown over the West Virginia State Capitol building year-round. Any United States or West Virginia state flag purchased with state funds must be manufactured in the United States; and West Virginia county boards of education must only purchase state flags manufactured in the United States if board building funds are used. To honor the death of law-enforcement officers within the state, the West Virginia Code permits the draping of the state flag over the coffin at no cost, upon the request of the next-of-kin.


=== Half-mast protocol ===
Effective July 18, 2013, the office of West Virginia Governor Earl Ray Tomblin established guidelines in accordance with the United States Code and West Virginia precedent and customs regarding the half-mast display of United States and West Virginia state flags on West Virginia state properties. Both the United States and West Virginia state flags are to be hoisted to full-mast, before being lowered to the half-mast position; likewise both flags are to be hoisted full-mast prior to being lowered for the day. Both flags are only to be displayed in the half-mast position in accordance with Federal law on the following occasions:
Memorial Day (the last Monday in May): flags are displayed at half-mast from sunrise until noon, then raised to full-mast.
Peace Officers Memorial Day (May 15): flags are displayed at half-mast for the entire day, unless that day is also Armed Forces Day (the third Saturday in May).
Patriot Day (September 11): flags are displayed at half-mast for the entire day.
National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day (December 7): flags are displayed at half-mast for the entire day.
Flags are displayed at half-mast for 30 days following the day of death of either a current or former President of the United States.
Flags are displayed at half-mast for ten days following the day of death of the Vice President of the United States, the Chief Justice or retired Chief Justice of the United States, or the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives.
Flags are displayed at half-mast from the day of death until the day of interment of a former vice president, an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, a Secretary of an executive or military department of the United States, or a Governor of a U.S. state, territory, or possession.
Flags are displayed at half-mast on the day of death and the following day for a member of the United States Congress.
Flags displayed at half-mast on state properties following a proclamation by the Governor of West Virginia during other unique instances outlined in the 2013 guidelines.


=== Desecration ===
According to West Virginia state law, the desecration of either the flag of the United States or the West Virginia state flag is an offense punishable as a misdemeanor and upon conviction, a guilty verdict can result in a fine ""not less than five nor more than one hundred dollars,"" or confinement in jail ""for a period not exceeding thirty days"" at ""the discretion of the court or justice trying the case.""However, such laws are unenforceable as the United States Supreme Court in Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989), and reaffirmed in U.S. v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310 (1990), has ruled that due to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, it is unconstitutional for a government (whether federal, state, or municipality) to prohibit the desecration of a flag, due to its status as ""symbolic speech.""


== Pledge of allegiance ==
On February 8, 1977, the office of the Secretary of State of West Virginia unanimously adopted the ""Pledge of Allegiance to the West Virginia State Flag."" The motion to adopt the pledge was made by Charles S. Smith and seconded by Carol J. Calvert. The pledge reads as follows:
I pledge allegiance to the flag of West Virginia, which serves as a constant reminder that ""Mountaineers Are Always Free,"" which stands as a symbol of her majestic mountains, fertile forests, rich veins of coal, and the pride of her people.

Lemos Building,"The Lemos Building is a historic Craftsman Fairy tale commercial building in downtown Carmel-by-the-Sea, California. It was built in 1929, by Louis Anderson, based on master builder Hugh W. Comstock's adjacent Tuck Box design. The building was designated as a significant commercial building in the city's Downtown Historic District Property Survey, and was recorded with the Department of Parks and Recreation on October 8, 2002. The Lemos Building continues today as the Carmel Groomers Pet Salon.


== History ==
Pedro J. Lemos (1882-1954), director of Stanford Museum and Art Galleries, bought the Art Shop (later called Tuck Box and adjacent property from Ray C. De Yoe in 1927. The space became known as the ""Early Bird"" and Lemos's vision was to fill it with unique shops and studios reminiscent of medieval shops in the ""old world cities.""In April 1929, Lemos designed a fairy-tale cottage for himself, based on Hugh W. Comstock's Tuck Box design, in the rear of the property, that Louis Anderson built for $1,000 (equivalent to $17,043 in 2022), called the Lemos Building, or Garden Shop. Anderson had worked on other Lemos projects in the San Francisco Bay Area. The Garden Shop sold flowers, plants, and garden tools. The shop later became known as the ""Tuck Box Jam Shop.""The Lemos Building is a one-and-one-half-story, steep pitched gabled shingled roof, wood-framed Fairy tale Craftsman style commercial building in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California. The exterior walls are rough textured stucco with exposed faux-timber frame posts and horizontal beams. There is a large window that copies the roof line looks down at the patio below. The front entrance is through a courtyard that it shares with the Tuck Box. A Dutch door, artwork, and Carmel stone is used along the front and porch entrance steps. A decorative oval sign hangs beneath the eves with the words ""The Garden Shop Carmel.""In November 1931, Lemos built a separate addition to the Garden Shop that was constructed by Hugh Comstock for $475 (equivalent to $9,140 in 2022). It is known as the Garden Shop Addition and is between the Tuck Box and the El Paseo Building. When it first opened it sold cut flowers, gift plants, and pottery.In 1932, the Tuck Box was the Tyler Book Shop that sold new and old books, some of which were displayed in the three-sided bay window. To the right of the shop was the Blue Bird Tea Garden, and the Garden Shop Addition had a sign that said ""The Garden Shop Flowers Plants Pottery."" There was also the Blue Bird Tea Room, that became a popular restaurant located on Ocean Avenue and Lincoln Street.In 1957, owners of the Tuck Box, purchased the Lemos building and renamed it the ""Tuck Box Gift Shop."" It was stocked with imports of linens, china, jewelry and pottery. The Tuck Box Gift Shop continued as a successful business until it was closed in November 1996.The Lemos Building qualifies for inclusion in the Downtown Historic District Property Survey as the only building designed by artist Pedro J. Lemos, who was president of the Carmel Art Association and one of the teachers of the Carmel Arts and Crafts Club. It is an example of a Storybook style commercial building designed by Lemos based on Hugh Comstock's Fairy-Tail style, and built by Louis Anderson in 1929. The Lemos Building, Garden Shop Addition, and Tuck Box are internationally associated with the city of Carme-by-the-Sea.

=== June in Buffalo Festival ===
The June in Buffalo Festival was founded at the University at Buffalo in 1975 by composer and UB Professor Morton Feldman, with sponsorship by the Rockefeller Foundation, New York State Council for the Arts, and the university at Buffalo. The festival was originally dedicated to emerging composers and to presenting and exposing new music to the world. The festival ran until 1980 and took a brief a hiatus until 1985 when David Felder revived the festival.From 1985 to 2022, Felder was the director of June in Buffalo, and expanded the program to include student composers, as well as, recently, student ensembles. June in Buffalo has run every June since 1985, and offers a week-long intensive schedule of seminars, lectures, workshops, professional presentations, participant forums and open rehearsals as well as afternoon and evening concerts open to the general public and critics. Each of the invited composers has one of their pieces performed during the festival. Evening performances feature faculty composers, resident ensembles and soloists renowned internationally as interpreters of contemporary music.


==== Slee Sinfonietta ====
June in Buffalo boasts a resident ensemble that performs regularly at the festival, the Slee Sinfonietta, which Felder co-founded with conductor Magnus Martensson, and began as artistic director in 1996. The Slee Sinfonietta is the professional chamber orchestra in residence at the university at Buffalo and presents a series of concerts each year that feature performances of challenging new works by contemporary composers and lesser-known works from the chamber orchestra repertoire. The Slee Sinfonietta consists of a core group including UB faculty performance artists, visiting artists, national and regional professionals and advanced performance students, and conducted by leading conductors and composers.

Slovenia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015,"Slovenia participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 with the song ""Here for You"" written by Raay, Marjetka Vovk and Charlie Mason. The song was performed by the duo Maraaya, which consists of Raay and Marjetka Vovk. Slovenian broadcaster Radiotelevizija Slovenija (RTV Slovenija) organised the national final EMA 2015 in order to select the Slovenian entry for the 2015 contest in Vienna, Austria. Eight entries competed in the national final where the winner was selected over two rounds of voting. In the first round, the top two entries were selected by a three-member jury panel. In the second round, ""Here for You"" performed by Maraaya was selected as the winner entirely by a public televote.
Slovenia was drawn to compete in the second semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest which took place on 21 May 2015. Performing during the show in position 16, ""Here for You"" was announced among the top 10 entries of the second semi-final and therefore qualified to compete in the final on 23 May. It was later revealed that Slovenia placed fifth out of the 17 participating countries in the semi-final with 92 points. In the final, Slovenia performed in position 1 and placed fourteenth out of the 27 participating countries, scoring 39 points.


== Background ==

Prior to the 2015 contest, Slovenia had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest twenty times since its first entry in 1993. Slovenia's highest placing in the contest, to this point, has been seventh place, which the nation achieved on two occasions: in 1995 with the song ""Prisluhni mi"" performed by Darja Švajger and in 2001 with the song ""Energy"" performed by Nuša Derenda. The country's only other top ten result was achieved in 1997 when Tanja Ribič performing ""Zbudi se"" placed tenth. Since the introduction of semi-finals to the format of the contest in 2004, Slovenia had thus far only managed to qualify to the final on three occasions. In 2014, ""Round and Round"" performed by Tinkara Kovač qualified to the final and placed twenty-fifth.
The Slovenian national broadcaster, Radiotelevizija Slovenija (RTV Slovenija), broadcasts the event within Slovenia and organises the selection process for the nation's entry. RTV Slovenija confirmed Slovenia's participation in the 2015 Eurovision Song Contest on 10 October 2014. The Slovenian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest has traditionally been selected through a national final entitled Evrovizijska Melodija (EMA), which has been produced with variable formats. To this point, the broadcaster has only foregone the use of this national final in 2013 when the Slovenian entry was internally selected. For 2015, the broadcaster opted to organise EMA 2015 to select the Slovenian entry.


== Before Eurovision ==


=== EMA 2015 ===
EMA 2015 was the 19th edition of the Slovenian national final format Evrovizijska Melodija (EMA), used by RTV Slovenija to select Slovenia's entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2015. The competition took place at the RTV Slovenija Studio 1 in Ljubljana, hosted by Nejc Šmit and former Slovenian Eurovision entrants Darja Švajger (1995, 1999), Maja Keuc (2011) and Tinkara Kovač (2014) and was broadcast on TV SLO1 and online via the broadcaster's website rtvslo.si. An online backstage broadcast at RTV Slovenija's official website also occurred concurrently with the competition.


==== Format ====
Eight songs competed in a televised show where the winner was selected over two rounds of voting. In the first round, a three-member expert jury selected two finalists out of the eight competing songs to proceed to a superfinal. Each member of the expert jury assigned a score of 1 (lowest score) to 5 (highest score) to each song with the top two being determined by the songs that receive the highest overall scores when the jury votes are combined. Ties were broken by giving priority to the song(s) that achieved a higher number of top scores (5), which would be followed by each juror indicating their preferred song should a tie still have persisted. In the superfinal, public televoting exclusively determined the winner. In case of technical problems with the televote, the jury would have voted to determine the winner in a similar process as in the first round of the competition.


==== Competing entries ====
Artists and composers were able to submit their entries to the broadcaster between 24 November 2014 and 21 December 2014. Several artists and composers were also directly invited by the broadcaster to submit entries. 145 entries were received by the broadcaster during the submission period. An expert committee consisting of Darja Švajger (1995 and 1999 Slovenian Eurovision entrant), Matej Wolf (musician, instrumentalist, arranger, producer and music teacher), Aleksander Radić (Head of the Slovenian delegation at the Eurovision Song Contest) and Jernej Vene (music editor for Radio Val 202) selected eight artists and songs for the competition from the received submissions. The competing artists were announced on 15 January 2015. Among the competing artists was former Slovenian Eurovision contestant Martina Majerle who represented Slovenia in 2009 alongside Quartissimo.


==== Final ====
EMA 2015 took place on 28 February 2015. In addition to the performances of the competing entries, Nadiya Bichkova, Brigita Vrhovnik Dorič and Maestro Dance Crew performed as guests. The winner was selected over two rounds of voting. In the first round, a three-member jury panel selected two entries to proceed to the second round. The jury consisted of the three female hosts Darja Švajger, Maja Keuc and Tinkara Kovač. In the second round, a public televote selected ""Here for You"" performed by Maraaya as the winner.


=== Promotion ===
Maraaya's promotion for ""Here for You"" as the Slovenian Eurovision entry included a performance on 18 April during the Eurovision in Concert event which was held at the Melkweg venue in Amsterdam, Netherlands and hosted by Cornald Maas and Edsilia Rombley.


== At Eurovision ==
According to Eurovision rules, all nations with the exceptions of the host country and the ""Big Five"" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) are required to qualify from one of two semi-finals in order to compete for the final; the top ten countries from each semi-final progress to the final. In the 2015 contest, Australia also competed directly in the final as an invited guest nation. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) split up the competing countries into five different pots based on voting patterns from previous contests, with countries with favourable voting histories put into the same pot. On 26 January 2015, an allocation draw was held which placed each country into one of the two semi-finals, as well as which half of the show they would perform in. Slovenia was placed into the second semi-final, to be held on 21 May 2015, and was scheduled to perform in the second half of the show.Once all the competing songs for the 2015 contest had been released, the running order for the semi-finals was decided by the shows' producers rather than through another draw, so that similar songs were not placed next to each other. Slovenia was set to perform in position 16, following the entry from Cyprus and before the entry from Poland.In Slovenia, the semi-finals were televised on RTV SLO2 and the final was televised on RTV SLO1. All shows featured commentated by Andrej Hofer. The contest was also broadcast via radio with the second semi-final and final airing on Radio Val 202. The Slovenian spokesperson, who announced the Slovenian votes during the final, was 2014 Slovenian Eurovision entrant Tinkara Kovač.


=== Semi-final ===
Maraaya took part in technical rehearsals on 14 and 16 May, followed by dress rehearsals on 20 and 21 May. This included the jury final on 20 May where the professional juries of each country watched and voted on the competing entries.The Slovenian performance featured the members of Maraaya joined by a dancer on stage who simulated the playing of a violin. The duo performed in outfits designed by Vesna Mirtelj: Marjetka Vovk wore a long white dress while Raay wore a casual black outfit. The dancer was dressed in black with glowing elements on her sleeve. Marjetka also wore Sennheiser brand headphones, which according to the performer was part of her stage image: ""To be honest, some years ago I was afraid to be on the stage. I always felt more comfortable in a studio. I've asked Raay if it would be okay to perform with the headphones on and that's how this idea was born."" The stage colours were bronze and blue. Maraaya was joined by three off-stage backing vocalists: Manca Špik, Nika Zorjan and Karin Zemljič. The dancer featured during the performance was Lara Balodis Slekovec.At the end of the show, Slovenia was announced as having finished in the top ten and subsequently qualifying for the grand final. It was later revealed that the Slovenia placed fifth in the semi-final, receiving a total of 92 points.


=== Final ===
Shortly after the second semi-final, a winner's press conference was held for the ten qualifying countries. As part of this press conference, the qualifying artists took part in a draw to determine which half of the grand final they would subsequently participate in. This draw was done in the order the countries were announced during the semi-final. Slovenia was drawn to compete in the first half. Following this draw, the shows' producers decided upon the running order of the final, as they had done for the semi-finals. Slovenia was subsequently placed to perform in position 1, before the entry from France.Maraaya once again took part in dress rehearsals on 22 and 23 May before the final, including the jury final where the professional juries cast their final votes before the live show. The duo performed a repeat of their semi-final performance during the final on 23 May. At the conclusion of the voting, Slovenia placed fourteenth with 39 points.


=== Voting ===
Voting during the three shows consisted of 50 percent public televoting and 50 percent from a jury deliberation. The jury consisted of five music industry professionals who were citizens of the country they represent, with their names published before the contest to ensure transparency. This jury was asked to judge each contestant based on: vocal capacity; the stage performance; the song's composition and originality; and the overall impression by the act. In addition, no member of a national jury could be related in any way to any of the competing acts in such a way that they cannot vote impartially and independently. The individual rankings of each jury member were released shortly after the grand final.Following the release of the full split voting by the EBU after the conclusion of the competition, it was revealed that Slovenia had placed nineteenth with the public televote and fifteenth with the jury vote in the final. In the public vote, Slovenia scored 27 points, while with the jury vote, Slovenia scored 36 points. In the second semi-final, Slovenia placed seventh with the public televote with 95 points and sixth with the jury vote, scoring 84 points.Below is a breakdown of points awarded to Slovenia and awarded by Slovenia in the second semi-final and grand final of the contest, and the breakdown of the jury voting and televoting conducted during the two shows:

"Hollywood, Florida","Hollywood is a city in Broward County, Florida, United States. It is a key suburb of the Miami metropolitan area, which was home to 6.14 million people in 2020. As of the 2020 census, the population was 153,067, making it the third-largest city in Broward County, the fifth-largest city in the Miami metro area, and the 12th-largest city in Florida. The average temperature is between 69 and 83 °F (21 and 28 °C).


== History ==
In 1920, Joseph Young arrived in South Florida to create his own ""Dream City in Florida"". His vision included the beaches of the Atlantic Ocean stretching westward with man-made lakes, infrastructure, roads, and the Intracoastal Waterway. He wanted to include large parks, schools, churches, and golf courses; these were all industries and activities that were very important to Young's life. After Young spent millions of dollars on the construction of the city, he was elected as the first mayor in 1925. This new town quickly became home to northerners known as ""snowbirds"", who fled the north during the winter and then escaped the south during the summer to avoid the harsh weather. By 1960, Hollywood had more than 2,400 hotel units and  12,170 single-family homes. Young bought up thousands of acres of land around 1920, and named his new town ""Hollywood by the Sea"" to distinguish it from his other real-estate venture, ""Hollywood in the Hills"", in New York.

The Florida guide, published by the Federal Writers' Project, describes the early development of Hollywood, an early example of a planned community that proliferated in Florida during the real-estate boom of the 1920s:

During the early days of development here, 1,500 trucks and tractors were engaged in clearing land and grading streets; two yacht basins, designed by General George Washington Goethals, chief engineer in the construction of the Panama Canal, were dredged and connected with the Intracoastal Waterway. A large power plant was installed, and when the city lights went on for the first time, ships at sea reported that Miami was on fire, and their radio alarms and the red glow in the sky brought people to the rescue from miles around.

Prospective purchasers of land were enticed by free hotel accommodation and entertainment, and ""were driven about the city-to-be on trails blazed through palmetto thickets; so desolate and forlorn were some stretches that many women became hysterical, it is said, and a few fainted. Young had a vision of having lakes, golf courses, a luxury beach hotel (Hollywood Beach Hotel, now Hollywood Beach Resort), country clubs, and a main street, Hollywood Boulevard. After the 1926 Miami hurricane, Hollywood was severely damaged; local newspapers reported that Hollywood was second only to Miami in losses from the storm. Following Young's death in 1934, the city encountered other destructive hurricanes, and the stock market crashed with personal financial misfortunes.Hurricane Irma hit Florida in 2017, wreaking widespread damage. Due to the spontaneity of the hurricane, nearly 700 elderly nursing-home residents died. In an investigation following the hurricane, some of the deaths were found to be not actually a result of the hurricane, but the poor conditions to which they were exposed in the aftermath. Four nursing-home staff charged with negligence and counts of manslaughter. Following the damage inflicted by Hurricane Irma in 2017, an initiative called Rebuild Florida was created by the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity to provide aid to citizens affected by the natural disaster. The initial focus of Rebuild Florida was its Housing Repair Program, which offered assistance in rebuilding families' homes that were impacted by Hurricane Irma. The program gave priority to low-income vulnerable residents, such as the disabled, the elderly, and those families with children under five. The success of this program has various results across the city, with hundreds of citizens claiming they were left without help.

Wehrsdorf,"Wehrsdorf (German) or Wernarjecy (Upper Sorbian) is a small village in a valley of the Lusatian Highlands in the region of Upper Lusatia (Oberlausitz) in Saxony, Germany.  It has about 1,776 inhabitants and belongs to an administrative community of three different villages, with Sohland an der Spree and Taubenheim. This community is offícially called Sohland after the largest of these villages. Altogether, the community has about 7,700 inhabitants. The village is near the border to the Czech Republic.


== Monuments ==
The most important building in the village is a Lutheran church, built in 1725 in the Baroque style.  The tower is more than 40 meters high and sends its greetings over the valleys of the region.  Near the church is an old cemetery with its typical flowered graves.  The most important architectural heritage of the southern part of Upper Lusatia is the so-called ""Umgebindehäuser"", special, half-timbered houses which unite the differences of the Slavic and the Franconian styles of wood houses.  Most of the present houses were built between 1850-1890.


== Religion ==
Most people are still atheists, as in the time of official Socialism, but there is also a Lutheran tradition and most people are linked to this religion, as well as a strong Catholic minority.  Upper Lusatia is typically a religious mixed region.


== Economy ==
In the time before reunification in 1990, the village was still a typical ""Saxon industrial village"" with four big and several small enterprises, all state-owned.  They produced furniture, clothing, metal instruments and more.  After the reunification, most of the firms were not able to survive; only the firm that produced furnitures still exists.  The high rate of unemployment today is also the primary reason why so many people have left the region.  But in comparison with other villages of Upper Lusatia, Wehrsdorf is still well off.
Before 1990, Upper Lusatia was a tourist area, and tourism is still important.  There are four restaurants, a hotel (****) and several private bed-and-breakfasts.

Spangles Muldoon,"Spangles Muldoon (5 October 1946 – 29 February 2008), real name Chris Cary, was a radio broadcaster best known for his work on British offshore radio stations, Radio Caroline and Radio North Sea International. He died in February 2008 aged 61, after suffering from a stroke. 
Cary was a key figure in the British rock music radio revolution of the 1960s. He was one of the DJs who broadcast from the offshore pirate radio ship, Radio Caroline in 1967 and 1968.[1]  At its peak, the station claimed 23 million listeners. In the 1970s, Cary was a DJ on RNI, before a stint at Radio Luxembourg. He operated Compshop in North London in the late 1970s. 
Around this time, he went to Ireland with Robbie Robinson and DJ Roger Swann to set up Sunshine Radio with the stated objective of broadcasting to holidaymakers in Majorca. The cars they travelled in (a Lincoln Continental and a Mercedes) contained much of the broadcasting equipment that they intended to fit to an ancient wooden-keeled sloop. Unfortunately, the Mercedes broke down on the M1, but the Lincoln Continental made it to Larne where the ""radio ship"" was being prepared. Swann left after 10 days or so and ended up working on the Voice of Peace station, but the pirate radio ship didn't make any further than Dublin. The final fate of the ship is unknown but rumour has it that some broadcasts to the Irish Republic were made from the vessel. 
In 1981, Cary returned to Ireland to set up Radio Nova, which was the most successful commercial Top 40 radio station in Ireland to date, in terms of professionalism and listenership. Many of the programming philosophies on Nova were based around Los Angeles station, KIIS-FM.
His son Nico Cary is a British triathlete.

It is the oldest specialist drama school in the British Isles and a founding member of the Federation of Drama Schools.The Academy's graduates work regularly at the Royal National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company, Shakespeare's Globe, and the theatres of London's West End and Hollywood, as well as on the BBC, HBO, and Broadway. It is registered as a company under the name LAMDA Ltd and as a charity under its trading name London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. There is an associate organisation in America under the name of American Friends of LAMDA (AFLAMDA). A very high proportion of LAMDA's stage management and technical theatre graduates find work in their chosen field within weeks of graduation. LAMDA alumni have received 5 Academy Awards (out of 13 Oscar nominations), 9 SAG Awards, 13 Tonys, 15 Emmys, 19 Golden Globes, 21 BAFTAs, and 39 Olivier Awards.LAMDA is in partnership with the Fulbright Program.

LAMDA Examinations in the fields of speech, drama, communication, and performance are taken by external students and are recognised by Ofqual, the regulator in England, and its counterparts in Wales and Northern Ireland. LAMDA-accredited examinations at Level 3 or above are recognised within the UCAS Tariff system. LAMDA's Principal is Professor Mark O'Thomas, who succeeded Director Sarah Frankcom in 2022. Benedict Cumberbatch succeeded Timothy West as President of LAMDA's Board of Trustees in 2018.


== History ==
The London Academy of Music was founded by Henry Wylde in 1861; this makes the Academy the oldest of its kind in Britain, after - for example - the Royal Academy of Music (1822) and the Crystal Palace School of Art, Science, and Literature (1854). Originally located at St. James's Hall, it was divided into two compartments, one for women and one for men. The Academy began on 15 November 1861, at which time the cost per annum was 15 guineas, or £15.75. The Academy accepted students for all ages ""with a decided talent, or showing an aptitude for learning"". Full scholarships were available.  The first philharmonic concert was held on 29 April 1863, following a public rehearsal on 25 April. It was a performance of Mendelssohn's Symphony No. 3.Providing training for, and examinations in, various musical disciplines was originally the dominant purpose of the institution. However, providing instruction in spoken English quickly became a core area of the Academy's work.
In the 1880s, LAMDA began offering speech examinations to the public. Since then, these examinations have been refined and developed into a comprehensive system of performance evaluation. LAMDA Examinations has emerged as the largest Speech and Drama Board in the United Kingdom.
In 1904, the school was amalgamated with two other London music institutions that had sprung up since the academy was founded, namely the London Music School (founded 1865) and the Forest Gate School of Music (founded 1885) renamed in 1906 the Metropolitan Academy of Music. (The Metropolitan Academy of Music severed its links with the London Academy of Music in 1907.)  In due course the Hampstead Academy was also amalgamated. The name was changed to the current name in 1935, under the direction of Wilfrid Foulis. In 1939, it was moved from London due to the war; when it reopened in 1945, it no longer provided musical training.LAMDA was previously an associate member of the Conservatoire for Dance and Drama, having joined in 2004, and received funding through the Conservatoire from the Office for Students. It left the Conservatoire on 31 July 2019 to become an independent institution, and now receives funding directly from the Office for Students and Research England.In August 2021 it was announced that Sarah Frankcom would step down as Director, and that LAMDA was conducting a search for a successor. In August 2022, LAMDA announced that Professor Mark O'Thomas had been unanimously appointed by the board of trustees as principal and chief executive, with Dr. Philippa Standberg-Long appointed as head of actor training.


== Facilities ==
In 2003, LAMDA decided to move its teaching school and theatre to its current location in Hammersmith in West London. It acquired the old premises of the Royal Ballet School on Talgarth Road.
The move to the Talgarth Road enabled LAMDA to develop a campus with new training facilities designed by Niall McLaughlin Architects. The site was previously home to the Royal Ballet School, which moved to new, purpose-built facilities adjacent to the Royal Opera House.
The LAMDA complex has three theatres and various rehearsal spaces and meeting rooms. The three theatres are the Sainsbury Theatre, the Carne Studio Theatre and the Linbury Studio.

Indigenous people in video games,"Indigenous people have created and collaborated on video games, such as John Romero, co-designer of Doom, and Allen Turner, who has worked as a designer on a wide range of titles including Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse. Indigenous people have also conveyed their cultures through games, such as Never Alone and Thunderbird Strike.While many early video games and their iterations which depict Indigenous people misrepresent them and perpetuate negative stereotypes, video games created by Indigenous people enable self-determination. Increasingly, there has been a growth in community organizing around Indigenous games worldwide. Indigenous developers and their video games have been featured in exhibitions including the DIGITAL MEDIA ART+CADE as part of imagineNATIVE, Memories of the Future/Souvenirs du futur at SAW Video Media Art Centre, and REGENERATION: Breaking Time with Indigenous Video Games at the Western Front.


== Games where Indigenous people represent themselves ==
Indigenous people have been involved in a range of video game projects where they have the opportunity to depict themselves. These games range in the style, from collaboration that involves consulting with a limited Indigenous people (including Assassin's Creed III) to games that are entirely developed and designed by Indigenous people, such as Never Alone and Thunderbird Strike.

== Games including Indigenous languages ==
There are also numerous video games which include or have been fully translated into Indigenous languages. MoniGarr produces many Indigenous language games for multiple platforms. Both of the video games made by kānaka maoli participants of the Skins Video Game workshops held in Hawai'i, He Ao Hou [2017]  and Wao Kanaka: Realm of the People [2018], were designed so that the player can play in ‘Ōlelo Hawai‘i as well as in English. Similarly, Karihonniennihtshera (Teachings) by Kahentawaks Tiewishaw can be played in English, wherein it teaches the player how to identify flora and fauna in the Kanien’kéha language, or played entirely in Kanien’kéha.
Full immersion is a design preference for some Indigenous game developers. Honour Water [2016] is a singing game entirely in Anishinaabemowin, much like the virtual reality game Along the River of Spacetime [2020]. Carl Petersen emphasizes full immersion in his games, which include Lakota instructions.In addition, there are games that have been localized to Indigenous languages. For example, Pinnguaq localized Osmos and Ittle Dew to Inuktitut and Mushroom 11 [2015] is available in Inuktitut and Algonquin.


== Academic studies ==
Research of Indigenous video games, ranging from representations to design and development, are on the rise. In 2017, Indigenous Studies journal Transmotion devoted a special issue to such research.Scholars vary in their fields, methods, and topics. Dean Mahuta (Māori) studies games in which Māori represent themselves. Outi Laiti (Sámi) does similar work for Sámi representations while also participating in game jams as interventions. Researchers including Deborah Madsen and Michelle Lee Brown have analyzed design in Indigenous games from an Indigenous lens. Elizabeth LaPensée looks at design and development processes as a designer, reinforced by work by Gabriel de los Angeles, Jeanette Bushnell, Jonathan Tomhave, and Maize Longboat.Player-oriented research seeks to understand how Indigenous games are received, both by wider audiences as well as Indigenous players. Related, Jakub Majewski's research examines how Australian Aboriginal gamers portray themselves through role-playing games, while Naithan Lagace studies how Indigenous representations in commercial games affect Indigenous players.Further research discusses copyright, protection of Indigenous knowledge, and appropriate portrayal of Indigenous cultures in regards to video games.

Willy Sägebrecht,"Willy Sägebrecht (21 February 1904 – 8 April 1981) was a political activist and politician from the Communist Party of Germany who was incarcerated as a resistance activist during the Nazi period.   After 1945 he became a member of East Germany's powerful Party Central Committee and then, in 1957, head of the country's Military Intelligence Service.


== Life ==


=== Provenance and early years ===
Willy Sägebrecht was born in Groß Schönebeck (Barnim), a short distance to the north of Berlin.   His father is described variously as a farmworker, a factory worker and a brick maker.  After leaving school in 1918 Sägebrecht worked in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors in Groß Schönebeck and Liebenwalde.   In 1920 he joined the Free German wood workers' union and the Young Socialists.   In 1923 he switched to the Young Communists and in 1925, having reached his twenty-first birthday six months earlier, he joined the Communist Party itself.  Within the party he was initially drawn to the extremist Weddinger Opposition faction, but after a couple of years he turned back to the Communist mainstream of the time, becoming a member of the party's local leadership team (""Bezirksleitung"") for Berlin-Brandenburg in 1927.In November 1929 Sägebrecht was elected a local councillor for Liebenwalde and a district councillor for Lower Barnim.   During 1929/30 he worked as an instructor in Berlin-Brandenburg with the party's ""Military Policy"" department (""Abteilung Militärpolitik""), the cover name used for what was in effect the party's intelligence service.   During 1930/31 he visited Moscow where he attended a course for party officials at the ""Military Academy"" of the Communist International (Comintern).   On his return he became a party instructor for Berlin-Brandenburg, a role he retained till 1933.     He was also employed as a policy leader (""Polleiter "") in the party's ""sub-region north"" (""Unterbezirk Nord""), in which capacity he worked closely with Walter Ulbricht.   On 24 April 1932 Willy Sägebrecht was elected to membership of the Prussian regional parliament (""Landtag"").   He was involved in a significant brawl in the parliament between Communist and Nazi members on 21 May 1932.


=== Nazi years ===
The Nazi Party took power at the start of 1933 and lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship.   On 4 April 1933 Sägebrecht and Max Herm, his comrade in the local leadership team (""Bezirksleitung""), were arrested.   They were subjected to physical mistreatment by Nazi paramilitaries at a nearby barracks and then taken to Sonnenburg concentration camp.   Sägebrecht was released at the end of October 1933.   He made contact with Albert Kayser, formerly a Communist member of the national parliament (""Reichstag""), and returned to party work - now illegal - in the Berlin sub-region.   He was re-arrested on 17 December 1934.In January 1936 Sägebrecht faced the special people's court and was convicted on the relatively unusual charge of ""intellectual activism"" (""intellektuelle Willenstäterschaft"").   He was sentenced to a five-year jail term, but in the event he spent the rest of the Nazi period in a succession of prisons and concentration camps, released only in April 1945.   His final transfer came in March 1941 and saw him sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp.   With other ""political detainees"" he created a ""party group"".   Observing the divisions among the Nazi camp administrators they were able to identify which guards might prove helpful if cultivated, and by this method they managed to receive regular newspapers and other snippets of news about Germany from outside the camp.   There were times when prisoners were sent to work outside the camp, and on one of these occasions the ""party group"" around  Sägebrecht managed to throw from the truck a number of anti-Hitler leaflets that they had managed to produce inside the concentration camp.During the early months of 1945 the Soviet army advanced relentlessly from the east, and in April the authorities in Germany desperately raced to empty the concentration camps.   Sachsenhausen inmates were evicted and sent on forced marches (death marches) towards the west and north, but as discipline collapsed it was increasingly the guards themselves who fled.   Sources state simply that in the course of the death march from Sachsenhausen towards Schwerin Willy Sägebrecht was freed by Soviet troops near Below.


=== Soviet occupation zone ===
Directly following the liberation, in the middle of May 1945 Sägebrecht became a member of the Communist Party Initiative Group around his old comrade, Walter Ulbricht.   On 30 April 1945 Ulbricht had been flown over from Moscow, where with many comrades he had spent the war, bringing a group of 30 men and, as matter turned out, a detailed and well thought through nation-building agenda.   The entire region surrounding Berlin - roughly the middle third of Germany - was now administered as the Soviet occupation zone.   Sägebrecht was employed by the Berlin city administration (""Magistratverwaltung"") in the social welfare section.   He also engaged, from Potsdam, in re-establishing a party leadership team (""KPD-Provinzialleitung Brandenburg""), becoming the Brandenburg regional party secretary.At the party conference of 2/3 March 1946 Willy Sägebrecht was one of 19 party officials co-opted onto the Party Central Committee.   A few weeks later, on 7 April 1946, the contentious special conference took place at which the old Communist Party was merged with the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in order to create the Socialist Unity Party (""Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands"" / SED).   The merger, which as events turned out was only directly implemented in the Soviet occupation zone, was intended to unite the political left and thereby make it impossible for right wing populists to take power, as had happened in 1933.   Sägebrecht gave a lead as one of thousands of comrades who lost no time in signing their Communist Party memberships across to the new party.  By the time the Soviet Occupation Zone was relaunched, in October 1949, as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany) the SED had itself become the ruling party in a new kind of German one-party dictatorship.
Under the Leninist power structure implemented in the Soviet Occupation Zone after 1946, political power was centralised on the Party Central Committee.   The political influence of parliaments or of government ministers was relatively constrained.   However, the centralisation of power was to some extent blurred by the fact that the same individuals often held positions of influence both within the Central Committee and in the quasi-democratic institutions.   Willy Sägebrecht was a case in point, sitting as a member of the People's Council (""Volksrat"") and then of its successor body, the East German national parliament (""Volkskammer"") between 1948 and 1958.   In 1950 he became, in addition, a member of the National Council of the National Front, the administrative structure used by the SED to control the allocation of parliamentary seats to bloc parties and mass organisations.
Between 1946 and 1950 he sat as a member of the Brandenburg Regional Parliament (""Landtag Brandenburg"").  From 1946 till 1949 he also shared the chairmanship of the regional Party Executive for Brandenburg with Friedrich Ebert Jr.     In December 1948 Ebert, who was son to the first president of the German Republic, became mayor of East Berlin, vacating his position as co-chair of the regional party executive.   Sägebrecht remained in post, now sharing the top job in the Brandenburg regional party executive with   Paul Bismark till July 1952.  Between 1949 and 1952 Willy Sägebrecht also served as first secretary of the Brandenburg Party Executive.   He was fully engaged in the Stalinisation of the Brandenburg party.


=== German Democratic Republic ===
In July 1952 Sagebrecht was appointed a secretary of state and first deputy chairman at the State Planning Commission (""Staatliche Plankommission"").   He might have seemed at this point to be on the verge of a stellar political career.   However, the State Planning Commission was also where the ambitions and promises of ambitious party leaders all too often came face to face with inconvenient economic realities.   Willy Sägebrecht was not the first, and he certainly would not be the last East German politician for whom involvement with the State Planning Commission broke the trajectory of a hitherto promising career in the political mainstream.   In 1954 he was diverted into the quasi-military ""Kasernierte Volkspolizei"" (KVP) police service, appointed a KVP colonel in October 1954.   He was responsible for ""Administration Co-ordination"" which according to at least one source was a ""camouglage designation"" for  Military Intelligence.In 1945 the World War victors were agreed that no future German state should be permitted to have an army.   Ten years later, cold war rivalries were calling that wartime consensus into question.   To the west, the American, British and French occupation zones were merged and relaunched as the German Federal Republic (West Germany) in May 1949, and the West German army (Bundeswehr) was inaugurated in November 1955.   In the former Soviet occupation zone (East Germany), it now transpired - at least from the western perspective - that the  quasi-military ""Kasernierte Volkspolizei"" ""police service"" had been created to be a national East German army by another name:  in March 1956 it was duly launched as the National People's Army ("" Nationale Volksarmee"").  Within it, in September 1957 Willy Sägebrecht became head of military intelligence  in succession to Karl Linke who had become suspected (correctly) of spying on behalf of ""the west"".   In the event of some sort of an east–west war, Sägebrecht's responsibilities would have included masterminding and conducting force-based operations in West Germany, including the activation of partisan networks.Sägebrecht himself was retired from his military intelligence responsibilities in August 1959, officially on health grounds.   In the words of one source ""he was not successful"".   His ""retirement"" came shortly after a senior member of his department, Siegfried Dombrowski, had fled to West Berlin.   His successor, appointed on 31 August 1959, was another senior member of the department, Arthur Franke, whom he had first met in 1945 as the two of them fled from the concentraion camp.There is no indication that Sägebrecht's own loyalty to the regime was ever in question:  he remained a Party Central Committee member till 1963.   However, after September 1959 he lived as a pensioner in East Berlin.   In 1968 he published his memoires under the title ""Nicht Amboß, sondern Hammer sein"" (loosely ""Not an anvil but a hammer"").   When he died, in 1981, his ashes were placed at the Friedrichsfelde Cemetery  in the Gedenkstätte der Sozialisten (""Socialists' Memorial Garden""), alongside those of others whose memories the government celebrated and revered.

Usina del Arte,"The Usina del Arte (lit. ""The Arts Powerhouse"") is a cultural centre and auditorium located on the former Don Pedro de Mendoza Power Plant (""Usina"" in Spanish) at La Boca neighborhood, Buenos Aires. It was built between 1912 and 1916 for the Italo-Argentina Electricity Company (Compañía Italo-Argentina de Electricidad, CIAE) in Florentine Renacentist style  In 2011 it was inaugurated as a cultural centre holding a state of the art Symphonic Auditorium as well as other concert and exhibition halls.


== History ==
The building was designed by the Italian architect Juan Chiogna to house a super-power plant of the Italo-Argentine Electricity Company (Compañía Italo-Argentina de Electricidad, CIAE) and built by the company Martignone and Sons between 1912 and 1916, when it was inaugurated. Between 1919 and 1921, the complex was expanded with new facilities to supply the growing demand of Buenos Aires. For the next 80 years it worked providing electricity to the city, until the service was nationalized in the 1990s. The building was later abandoned by the state company and fell into disrepair.After a decade of abandonment, between August and September 2000, the national and city governments agreed on a joint program to undertake the recovery of the structure as the headquarters of the Auditorium of the City of Buenos Aires and definitive headquarters of the National Symphonic and Philharmonic orchestras of Buenos Aires. The project included a large nave in which two halls or auditoriums would function (one for 1,700 spectators and the other for 500) with a transversal route designed to unify the two entrances, and a secondary body where offices, businesses, cafeterias and more services such as sales of instruments or sheet music were to be located. The foundation stone was laid in November 2007 with the project named ""Usina de las Ideas"" (""Ideas Powerhouse""). In 2011 the first stage of the project was completed and a year later the official inauguration took place with the changed name of ""La Usina del Arte"" (The Arts Powerhouse"") and a concert in tribute to tango genius Astor Piazzolla. In 2013 the Chamber Music Hall was opened to the public with a series of concerts.


== Architecture ==
The building stands out for its distinctive Italianate late Gothic or early Renacentist architecture and its clock tower which can be seen from a distance, especially from the La Plata freeway that today bestrides it, ""an almost exact reproduction of the Florentine Palazzo Della Signoria"". The interiors are large rooms that were used for electric generators, with iron truss roofs and a zinc sheet roof. This power plant was the largest of a series of buildings designed to house the facilities of the Italo-Argentina Electricity Company throughout the city by the Italian architect Giovanni Chiogna, seeking to achieve a common aesthetic denominator that would make all the buildings identifiable with the company:“This architecture is immediately recognizable by its exposed brick walls, semicircular or segmental arches in doors and windows (often with the keystone highlighted), blind arches, friezes with moldings, the company heraldry in coats of arms applied to the walls, pediments with the company name engraved in elegant letters, rosettes, skylights, battlements, whimsical decorative details and occasionally a tower; everything with lines that remind us of the European twelfth century.”
""The square tower with battlements, the inclusion of the clock, the use of gargoyles and semicircular arches with the addition of the exposed bricks and plaster elements imitating stone blocks that the Pedro de Mendoza Powerhouse shows on its exterior summarize just some of the characteristics that Chiogna used in all the works carried out for the CIAE and almost simultaneously with the completion of this one. Of a similar category were their interior spaces, where the presence of pillars, corbels, ironwork elements and even the floors with the Company logo refer to the importance of conceiving an integral project.""

"Raglan, New Zealand","Raglan (Māori: Whāingaroa or Rakarana) is a small beachside town located 48 km west of Hamilton, New Zealand on State Highway 23. It is known for its surfing, and volcanic black sand beaches.


== History ==
The Ngāti Māhanga iwi occupied the area around Raglan in the late 18th century. There are at least 81 archaeological sites in the area, mainly near the coast. Limited radiocarbon dating puts the earliest sites at about 1400AD. The Māori people named the site Whaingaroa (""the long pursuit""). One tradition says that Tainui priest, Rakataura, crossed Whāingaroa on his way to Kāwhia. Another says it was among the places the early Te Arawa explorer, Kahumatamomoe, with his nephew Īhenga, visited on their expedition from Maketū.
The first Europeans to settle in the area, the Rev James and Mary Wallis, Wesleyan missionaries, were embraced and welcomed by local Māori in 1835. European settlement, including large scale conversion of land to pasture, began in the mid-1850s after a large sale of land by Chief Wiremu Neera Te Awaitaia.
The name ""Raglan"", adopted in 1858, honours Fitzroy Somerset, 1st Lord Raglan (1788–1855), who had commanded the British forces in the Crimean War of 1853–1856.The Raglan economy initially featured flax and timber exports, followed by farming which remains the mainstay of the area.
Raglan's first coach link to Hamilton began in 1880 and a telegraph wire was put up beside the road in 1884. In 1904 Raglan was linked to Hamilton telephone exchange. Mains electricity came in 1935 and a sewage scheme in 1977.Tourism and the arts are significant contributors to the current economy. Raglan and District Museum/ Te Whare Taonga o Whāingaroa contains historic artefacts and archives from the region.  A new museum building was built in 2011. Additionally, the Raglan and District Museum's online collection can be accessed here.


=== Airfield ===
The town became the scene of public civil disobedience campaigns in the 1970s. In 1941, during World War II (1939–1945), the New Zealand Government took local ancestral land from indigenous Māori owners to construct a military airfield. When no longer required for defence purposes, part of the land, a 62-acre (25 ha) block, was not returned to the owners, but instead was transferred to Raglan County Council in 1953 and became the public Raglan golf-course in 1968.There ensued widespread protest and attempts to reoccupy the land; in 1978, 20 Māori protesters were arrested on the ninth hole of the golf course. The land was eventually returned to the owners. 150 people were involved in the protest. 
It became a focus for local job-training and employment programs, as well as for the Māori sovereignty movement. In 2021 the council suggested return of the rest of the land could still ""take a number of years"". Fencing of the airfield in 2021 halved its width and resulted in a petition to close it.On August 21, 2022, local councillors unanimously voted to begin the process of returning the airfield land to its original Māori owners.


=== Local government ===
Raglan Highway Board existed from 1868 and merged with the Karioi Board between 1888 and 1892. Raglan Town Board started in 1878 and merged with the highways boards into Raglan County Council in 1889. It was re-inaugurated as Raglan Town Board in 1906 and continued until 1938, when the Board again merged into the County Council. In 1954 Raglan became a county township, administered by a committee of 7 under the jurisdiction of the county council. On 26 March 1957 Raglan Town Committee resigned due to the unsympathetic attitude of the council. Within a month more than 100 ratepayers had petitioned the Governor-General to establish a town board. The Local Government Act 1974 brought about Raglan Community Council, which was replaced by Raglan Community Board in 1989, when Waikato District Council was formed.


=== Demographics ===
In 1859 the local magistrate, F. D. Fenton, reported the population of Whāingaroa as 424. That was the number shown in the 1858 census for the Ngāti Mahanga population of Raglan. That accords with Ferdinand von Hochstetter's account of his 1859 tour, when he said that the Māori population was estimated at 400 and said that he had been told there were 122 Europeans, including 20 farmer-families. Hochstetter said there were six or eight houses, with a tavern and a store in Raglan and a Māori village and an old pā at Horea on the north shore. Many of the Europeans were evacuated in 1860 and again in 1863, when war threatened and it was said 95 inhabitants remained.After that, as the graph below shows, Raglan's population recovered slowly until the main road from Hamilton was completely metalled in 1921 and then grew again after completion of tar-sealing in 1961.The population of the Raglan ward (covering most of the harbour catchment area) was 4680 in 2006. It had increased to 4920 in 2013.
The figures and sources are:

Raglan covers 4.90 km2 (1.89 sq mi) and had an estimated population of 3,880 as of June 2023, with a population density of 792 people per km2.
Raglan had a population of 3,279 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 573 people (21.2%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 651 people (24.8%) since the 2006 census. There were 1,251 households, comprising 1,602 males and 1,677 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.96 males per female. The median age was 39.6 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 672 people (20.5%) aged under 15 years, 477 (14.5%) aged 15 to 29, 1,620 (49.4%) aged 30 to 64, and 507 (15.5%) aged 65 or older.
Ethnicities were 82.9% European/Pākehā, 26.5% Māori, 2.9% Pacific peoples, 2.5% Asian, and 2.7% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.
The percentage of people born overseas was 21.4, compared with 27.1% nationally.
Although some people chose not to answer the census's question about religious affiliation, 61.8% had no religion, 25.1% were Christian, 1.3% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.3% were Hindu, 0.2% were Muslim, 0.8% were Buddhist and 2.4% had other religions.
Of those at least 15 years old, 732 (28.1%) people had a bachelor's or higher degree, and 402 (15.4%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $27,200, compared with $31,800 nationally. 426 people (16.3%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 1,173 (45.0%) people were employed full-time, 522 (20.0%) were part-time, and 87 (3.3%) were unemployed.Growth by about 500 households is expected by 2045 and to 12,500 by 2070, with several new suburbs.Property prices have risen sharply since 2000, for example by 49.6% from 2014 to 2017 and a further 42% to 2020. That coincides with a decline in the Māori proportion of the population –

By 2018 there were 6 fewer unoccupied private dwellings at 471, but those occupied had increased to 1,275.
Employment and commuting increased between 2006 and 2013, as shown in this table.


=== Marae ===
Raglan has several marae within 25 km (16 mi), affiliated with hapū of Waikato Tainui:

Poihākena Marae and Tainui a Whiro meeting house is a meeting place for Ngāti Tāhinga and Tainui hapū
Te Kōpua Marae is a meeting place of Tainui hapū and does not have a meeting house, as it was destroyed on 12 August 1941 to create the airfield
Te Kaharoa or Aramiro Marae and Te Kaharoa meeting house is a meeting place of Ngāti Māhanga and Ngāti Tamainupō, near the head of the Waitetuna valleyThe hapū of Ngāti Tamainupō also have a meeting place, Mai Uenuku ki te Whenua Marae, in the inner harbour, between Te Uku and Waingaro.In 2018, it produced a local history book about prominent Waikato chief Ngaere and how Ngāruawāhia and the Hakarimata Ranges were named in the late 1600s.In October 2020, the Government committed $414,300 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade Mai Uenuku ki te Whenua Marae, creating 8 jobs.


== Geography ==
Raglan is associated with Whāingaroa Harbour (also known as Raglan Harbour) on the west coast of the Waikato region in New Zealand's North Island. The harbour catchment extends as far north as Glen Afton, covers 525 km2 (203 sq mi) and the harbour covers 35 km2 (14 sq mi) and has 133 km (83 mi), 137.32 km (85.33 mi), or 220 km (140 mi), of coastline. It runs 12 km inland from the entrance, for the most part is less than 2 km wide, has a high-tide area of 32.96 km2 (12.73 sq mi), a low-tide area of 9.01 km2 (3.48 sq mi), 2–4 m tidal range, with a spring-tide range of 2.8 m and neap 1.8 m, spring tide flow around 46 x 106 m3 and neap 29 x 106 m3. A 2005 survey said on average water stays in the harbour 1.1 days at spring-tides, but a 2015 study showed a median residence time for whole estuary of 39.4 days with median river flows, ranging between 18 and 45 days. It is the northernmost of three large inlets in the Waikato coast (the others, also drowned river valleys, are Aotea Harbour and Kawhia Harbour). 15 significant rivers and streams run into the harbour, including the largest, Waingaro and Waitetuna, accounting for 60% of catchment area, and the smaller Opotoru and Tawatahi rivers. Total length of the streams is 826 km (513 mi).A study for Regional Council said, ""Whāingaroa Harbour began to fill with sediment at least 8000 years before present (B.P.) and before the sea had reached its present level 6500 years B.P. Rapid sedimentation in the harbour before 6500 years B.P. is attributed to the formation of now relict intertidal shore platforms up to 700-m wide and ≤10 m below present-day mean high water level. These coastal landforms were rapidly formed 8000-6500 years B.P. by physical weathering of soft mudstone cliffs and wave action. Consequently, all but the upper two metres of the present day sediment column was deposited before 6000 years B.P. and thousands of years before the arrival of Maori some 700 years ago. Today, the harbour has largely infilled with catchment sediment up to ~8-m thick, with 70% of its high tide surface area being intertidal."" It concluded that most sediment is now swept up to 20 km out to sea.70% of the land in the harbour catchment is used for farming, 20% of it is under native vegetation, 14% under forestry, 7% mānuka/kānuka and 0.3% wetlands. 68% of land has slopes greater than 1 in 4.Southwest of the township stands the extinct volcano of Mt Karioi. According to Māori legend Karioi was a jilted Māori Princess who, upon discovering that love was lost, lay down and rests.
North of the harbour mouth there are extensive dunes and dune-dammed lakes. Like the beaches, the dunes are rich in ironsand and have been considered for mining several times. Threats of seabed mining following passage of the Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004 resulted in formation of the opposition group KASM, based in Raglan (see also Mining in New Zealand and Sand mining).
The area is also home to the popular tourist destination, Bridal Veil Falls, which is located 20 kilometres southeast of the township and the unusual Lake Disappear 4 km further on.


=== Suburbs ===


==== Raglan East ====
Raglan East was Raglan's first suburb. It was formed after Henry Chamberlin sold his estate in 1863.


==== Raglan West ====
Raglan West developed after the farm containing the site of the Wesleyan Nihinihi mission station (see History above) was surveyed between 1940 and 1952.


==== Rangitahi ====
Rangitahi was the name of a farm. A concrete bridge from Raglan West replaced a tidal causeway in 2019 and work started on developing 259 residential lots. Over 550 houses are being built in stages on 117 ha (290 acres).


== Climate ==
Average annual rainfall at Raglan 1984–2004 was 1.354m a year. Average temperature and rainfall graphs show an average high of 24C in February and an average low of 8C in July. Raglan usually has no more than a degree of frost and then only for a few hours on occasional winter mornings.


== Education ==
Raglan Area School is a co-educational state composite school covering years 1 to 13,  with a roll of 557 as of April 2023. There have been schools at Raglan since 1866. The current school opened as Raglan District High School in 1937.There are also primary schools in the nearby settlements of Te Mata, Te Uku and Waitetuna, it is very common in recent years for students to move from the Te Mata, Te Uku and Waitetuna primary schools to RAS when they reach high school due to it being a nearby, bicultural and accepting school full of students that have often already met their contemporaries from Te Mata, Te Uku and Waitetuna.


== Surf breaks ==

Raglan is best known for its surf. Eight kilometres from the Raglan township is a series of surf breaks including Indicators, Whale Bay, Manu Bay, Vortex Bay. Manu Bay was featured in the 1966 movie The Endless Summer  and in the 2010 movie Last Paradise. The traditional name for Manu Bay is 'Waikeri', meaning surging or swirling waters. The former native reserve was bought for a recreation reserve in 1971.Indicators is a left hand point break that breaks for up to 600m, from 2 to 10 feet+ (Hawaiian scale). It is a long-walled, fast wave with occasional barrels, particularly on the low tide. It picks up a lot of swell and is very consistent. On big days the wave can link up with the next break called Whale Bay.
Whale Bay is a left hand point break that breaks up to 200m in length, from about 2 to 8 feet+. It has two sections, an inside hollow section up to about 4 feet that breaks very close to the rocks, and an outside, slower section from 4 feet up. It has been rumoured by locals to link up with the next break further down-Manu Point-but only on very large swells, making a potential ride of up to 2 km from the top of Indicators, which locals say has only been achieved once.
Manu Bay is a left hand point break which works from 2 to 10 feet+, breaking over 300m. It has alternate hollow and wall sections, occasional barrels, and is usually about 2/3 the size of Indicators.
Vortex Bay is a soft peak east of the boat ramp that sometimes breaks on low tide when the swell is too large for the main three points.
There is also a beach break further down from Manu Point. Ruapuke is another beach break well to the west around the point.
Raglan has hosted a world championship surfing event at Manu Bay in 1998. Raglan is also home to New Zealand's first sanctioned surf school, the Raglan Surfing School which was established in 1999.


== Arts ==
Visual artists hold regular exhibitions at the Raglan Old School Art Centre.  Fabric artists show their creations in the biennial ArtoWear competition.  There is also a Raglan Arts Trail Guide with an Open Studio Weekend in late January. For Matariki there are displays of Māori art.  Local art is on display in the Show Off Gallery, Kanuka Design, Matapihi Gallery, local cafes and the Raglan Old School Arts Centre. The Arts Centre is in a 19th-century heritage building, the former Raglan School.


== Markets ==
There is a regular market on the second Sunday of every month at the Raglan Old School Arts Centre in Stewart Street.  This Raglan Creative Market specialises in local crafts, food and art.


== Music ==
There's a live music scene in Raglan.  The International Soundsplash Eco Reggae Festival ran yearly in summer on the Wainui Reserve, between 2001 and 2008 and more recently, and attracted some of the biggest names in roots, reggae and dub, as well as local acts.

The main venue in Raglan for live music is the Yot Club, a regular stop for NZ musicians on national tours.  There is also live music at the Orca Restaurant and Bar, the Harbour View Hotel, the Raglan Club and The Old School.The New Zealand reggae bands Cornerstone Roots and Zionhill were formed in Raglan.


== Walking ==
Whāingaroa has a variety of walks, from an easy stroll over the footbridge to the more strenuous Mount Karioi tracks. Walking has been a popular activity here since at least 1915, when the guidebook said, ""An hour's walk brings one to the harbour entrance and to the sea coast. Here there is a wide sandy beach with a background of bush-covered cliffs, and the picturesque Mount Karioi close at hand"" and went on, ""Many suitable landing places are to be found where parties may leave the launch for a ramble ashore or may picnic ‘neath the shade of the kowhai trees"". (see also Walking trip resources below)


== Cycling ==
Several sections of a Town2Surf cycle lane have been built, which will link the town with Ngarunui Beach, and Te Ara Kākāriki Ocean Trails opened on 3 December 2016, providing about 4 km (2.5 mi) of mountain bike trails in a pine forest on Wainui Reserve. A 43 km (27 mi) to 85 km (53 mi) bike race, mainly on gravel roads around Mt Karioi, took place each July, from 2009 to 2021. About 21 km (13 mi) from Raglan, Pipiwharauroa Way has 9 km (5.6 mi) of cycle/walking track, which links to a very difficult 7 km (4.3 mi) paper road to Waitetuna.


== Environment ==
Whāingaroa has a high proportion of environmentalists, as evidenced by the existence of several high-profile environmental groups. The proportion of environmentalists in Raglan is indicated by the size of the Green Party vote, which was 28% in 2011 and rose to 30% in 2014 (266 of 867 in the Taranaki-King Country constituency vote and 40 of 152 in Hauraki-Waikato). In 2017 it dropped to 20% (433), but the Labour vote rose from 18% to 40% (872), when Labour also highlighted environmental issues.
The environmentalism has been recognised in local government policy as, ""passionate about the arts and protecting its environment"".


=== Whāingaroa Harbour Care ===
Whāingaroa Harbour Care has planted more than 2 million trees since it started in 1995.
After discussions in 1994 with the local MP and Minister for the Environment, Simon Upton, about the poor environmental state of the harbour, a meeting was held on 24 March 1995, leading to the formation of Whāingaroa Harbour Care Incorporated Society in July 1995. A plant nursery was set up on Wainui Reserve to collect eco-sourced (with genes better adapted to local conditions) local seeds, grow them into native trees and plant them densely beside streams, to reduce run-off of nutrients and other pollutants by up to 60%. By 2013 over 40 farmers had fenced and planted about 450 km (280 mi) of riparian areas.(see also Environmental organisations below)


== Recycling ==

Recycling in Raglan is managed by a non-profit organization called Xtreme Zero Waste.  Xtreme's stated goal is to create a waste management system for the Raglan/Whāingaroa community in which none of the waste is stored in landfills.  The organization was founded in 2000, after Raglan's landfill closed and the town decided to find an alternative to transporting its waste elsewhere.  Xtreme Waste has recycled an increasing volume and percentage of waste every year, and as of 2010, it diverts nearly three-quarters of the town's waste from reaching the landfill. It operates a recycling center, which is open to the public and offers group tours.Actor Antonio Te Maioha, who lives in Raglan, has publicly spoken about his own involvement and Raglan's leadership in recycling.  He mentioned that Raglan is one of the few towns in New Zealand with recycling bins in the main street, and describes how people he knew became involved in recycling because of Xtreme Waste's programs.


== Water supply ==
Raglan's water supply comes from a well and the nearby Waipatukahu (or Riki) Spring between Te Hutewai Rd and Omahina Creek, about 3 km (1.9 mi) south of Raglan, where water which has sunk into the volcanic rocks, seeps along the contact with the Tertiary beds.Water is chlorinated, pumped to a 1,335 m3 (294,000 imp gal) tank and distributed through about 42 km (26 mi) of pipes. Tanks at Bow St (1,000 m3 (220,000 imp gal)) and Cornwall Rd, (1,250 m3 (270,000 imp gal)) maintain pressure. Demand has been forecast at 3,606 m3 (793,000 imp gal) per day by 2034, based on a Waikato University population prediction assuming consumption of 260 L (57 imp gal)/person/day. However, in December 2015 use was averaging 1,510 m3 (330,000 imp gal) a day. The capacity of the spring is 4,800 m3 (1,100,000 imp gal) per day. Consent allows up to 3,100 m3 (680,000 imp gal)/day (the remainder maintains a flow in the short stream below the spring) from the spring and 500 m3 (110,000 imp gal)/day from the well. Despite using less than half the consented water, water meters are planned to be installed and operational by 2017. When last rated Raglan's water got a poor 'Ed' (unsatisfactory level of risk) rating, but work was done in 2014 to upgrade the quality.


=== History ===
The spring was long used as a source of fresh water. In 1862 a dam was built and it was used to power an 8 ft (2.4 m) waterwheel for a flaxmill. In the early 1950s the spring was again used to power a water-wheel, this time pumping water for use on the farm.Several residents had bores drilled, but over half (1000) relied on tank water. A 2½ in. bore behind the Harbour View Hotel had 1,920 imp gal (8.7 m3)/day rising to about 8 ft (2.4 m) below the surface, though rather hard and tinged with iron. Of its 160 ft (49 m) the first 50 ft. was in clay, 4 ft. in hard blue shingle tightly packed with a minimum of sandy matrix and 106 ft in papa. The 225 ft (69 m) deep, 3 in. bore for the dairy factory, 70 ft. above sea-level in Rose St, was polluted with ammoniacal nitrogen and chlorides too were high.As early as 1927 the government was being asked for help with water and sewage. In 1938, ratepayers petitioned the council for a water supply and in 1938 DSIR reported on Waipatukahu Spring where, ""Beautifully clear water rises in a pool perhaps 6 ft. across on the floor of Omahina Creek at a point some 10 ch (200 m) up from the south end of the tidal flat and a few chains above sea-level"" and flow had been measured at 900,000 imp gal (4,100 m3)/day, close to the 4,800 mentioned above.
In 1938 the Council said the annual cost of a loan would be £700 for an estimated total cost of £10,000. Another sewage and water scheme was considered in 1949, but still the cost of a loan was too high. Despite pollution, the Rose St bore was connected to the low areas of town and the camping ground. Council put in a new pump, but it could only pump  24,000 imp gal (110 m3)/day, so in the 1959 a bore was drilled at Warihi Park, but abandoned in 1962 due to problems with flow and gas in the water. A 1959 £100,000 estimate for Riki springs supply was still considered too expensive.
Finally, in 1961 Council got a £62,000 loan to bring water from Riki Springs, for a pump to lift water up the hill to tanks (another large reservoir was added in 1981), from where it ran by gravity to the top of Bow St.In October 1963, 4 weeks of dry weather resulted in council carting water to fill empty tanks. By Christmas 1963 household tanks were being filled by long hoses connected to the half-finished mains. On 8 July 1964, the first householders were invited to apply for a supply. There were problems with Christmas peak supplies and an upgrade was installed in 1972. In 1981 an extra reservoir was built in Cornwall Rd quarry.In the late 1980s, the Community Arts Council got a mural painted on the water tower. It was restored in 2015.


== Sewage ==
Since 1976 sewage from the town has been pumped to a treatment works to the west, with the treated effluent pumped, mainly on outgoing tides, into the mouth of the harbour. Ultra violet treatment was added in 2008 and aquamats (high surface–area polymer filters) and other upgrades in 2017, but the resource consent conditions for total suspended solids and faecal coliforms are still being breached. A proposal to use subsurface drip field irrigation, rather than disposal to sea is being considered, but may be postponed again.

ORF 1,"ORF 1 (ORF eins) is an Austrian public television channel owned by ORF. It was the first television channel in Austria, started in 1955.
ORF 1 is one of four public TV channels in Austria. It is funded by a mixture of advertising revenue and television licence fees: as such, unlike the German TV stations (which are generally available free-to-air), ORF 1 and its sister channels are encrypted over satellite.


== Programming ==
ORF 1 mainly shows films, TV series and sporting events; this is in contrast to ORF 2, which focuses more on news, documentaries and cultural programming. As the target audience of ORF 1 is younger than that of ORF 2, ORF's children's output, okidoki, is broadcast on ORF 1 every morning. Popular sporting events, such as skiing, Formula One and association football are also usually shown on ORF 1. ORF has exclusive rights to many sports; for example, it holds the rights to Formula One until 2020. In addition to the regular commentary, some sporting events, as well as some dramas, carry special commentary tracks for the visually impaired, via the Zweikanalton system.Until 9 April 2007, ORF's flagship news programme Zeit im Bild (The Times in Pictures) was broadcast at 7:30pm on both ORF 1 and ORF 2; as part of a major programme overhaul, this was replaced on ORF 1 with the soap opera Mitten im 8en. Due to poor ratings, the soap was short-lived and was replaced on 2 July 2007 by Malcolm in the Middle. To fill the void left by removing Zeit im Bild from ORF 1, two new news programmes entitled ZiB 20 and ZiB 24 were introduced; as their names suggest, they are broadcast at 8pm (20:00) and midnight (24:00) every night. In addition, short bulletins known as ZiB Flash are shown several times throughout the day.
Feature films form a key part of the primetime output on ORF 1, and are shown several nights a week: many movie premieres are shown at the same time as on German broadcasters, but without the commercial interruptions that are commonplace on private German channels. Certain films and series are broadcast with both the German dub and the original (usually English) soundtrack via Zweikanalton (Two-channel sound).

== High definition broadcast ==
On 28 January 2008, ORF started its high-definition services. The first broadcast was a ski race called The Nightrace in Schladming. A special HDTV event, introducing HD technology, was scheduled in all regional ORF stations right after. The technological partner for HD productions is Telekom Austria. Test operations began on 1 May 2008: ten days later, these were made available to any households with an ORF card showing a trailer. Those who could receive ORF 1 HD would see a trailer which showed excerpts from sports footage, films and documentaries.ORF 1 HD officially launched on 2 June 2008, five days before the start of 2008 UEFA European Football Championship.


=== Reception ===
ORF 1 HD is broadcast on Astra 19.2° east on 10,832 GHz horizontal (SR 22000, FEC 5/6). The channel is also available through Cable and IPTV.


=== Programming ===
Initially, the vast majority of programmes were upscaled, save for some sporting events, movie premieres and American television series. However, this has gradually increased; more and more of ORF's productions have been in HD, and many older copies of movies and TV series were re-sourced and replaced with HD scans; for example, older episodes of The Simpsons have been remastered in HD and, as of 2017, are broadcast in this format on ORF 1.


== Parental guidance ==
ORF abridges some movies due to child-protection rules, but less often than German stations. ORF identifies its programs with initials: X (not suited for children; parental guidance advised), O (adults only), or with no initial. The sign K+ (recommended for children) is shown only on teletext.


== Branding ==
From 1968 until 1992, ORF 1 prominently featured the red ""ORF eye"" logo in its television idents alongside several stylised number ""1"" logos. In 1992, the first version of the ""green cube"" ORF 1 logo was introduced, designed by Neville Brody. In 2000, ORF 1's logo was updated into a moving, soft-edged, gelatinous cube with the number 1 inside. This particular logo has been nicknamed ""Jelli."" In 2005, there was another update to ORF's on-screen design: to avoid the logo being burnt in to plasma screens, it was changed from green to grey all-over.
In 2010, it was announced that ORF 1 would be rebranded as ""ORF eins"" from 8 January 2011.
On 26 April 2019, ORF eins was renamed back to ORF 1 with a brand new logo and on-screen design by design agency Bleed.

Charles Beadle,"Charles Beadle (October 27, 1881 – 1944?) was a novelist and pulp fiction writer, best known for his adventure stories in American pulp magazines, and for his novels of the bohemian life in Paris.
He was born at sea. His father, Henry Beadle, was a ship captain, and traveled with his wife Isabelle. Charles grew up in Hackney, in greater London, attending boarding schools. He left home as a teenager and traveled. He served in the British South Africa Police in Southern Rhodesia, doing duty in the Boer War. After the war he traveled up East Africa. He was in Morocco from 1908 to 1912, and began his writing career.His first known published work was an article, ""Our Trip Down the Zambezi,"" in The Wide World Magazine (May 1907). His first known published fiction was the novel The City of Shadows: A Romance of Morocco (1911). He sailed to New York City, arriving on November 14, 1916. He established himself as a pulp adventure writer, publishing authentic stories of Africa for Adventure, Argosy, Short Stories, The Frontier, etc. He also wrote sea stories.
His most successful work was probably Witch-Doctors, a four-part serial in Adventure (issues of March 15 to May 1, 1919). It was published as a book in 1922, both in the U.S. and London.
By 1920, he was living in Paris, which appears to have been his residence for the rest of his life. He published at least one book, The Esquimau of Montparnasse, on the bohemian scene in Paris.
He is presumed to have died in France, although his date of death is unknown. His last known published work was ""Nameless Spy,"" a ten-page story in Short Stories (June 10, 1947).

List of vice presidents of Argentina,"The vice president of Argentina (Spanish: Vicepresidente de Argentina), officially known as the vice president of the Argentine Nation (Spanish: Vicepresidente de la Nación Argentina), is the second highest political position in Argentina, and first in the line of succession to the president of Argentina. 
The office was established with the enactment of the Argentine Constitution of 1853.
The vice president assumes presidential duties in a caretaker in case of absence or temporary incapacity of the head of state, and may succeed to the presidency in case of resignation, permanent incapacity, or death of the president. The longest vice presidential tenure as caretaker in Argentine history took place between 1865 and 1868, while President Bartolomé Mitre was preoccupied with the Paraguayan War. Seven Argentine vice presidents have succeeded to the presidency: Juan Esteban Pedernera (1861); Carlos Pellegrini (1890); José Evaristo Uriburu (1895); José Figueroa Alcorta (1906); Victorino de la Plaza (1914); Ramón Castillo (1942); and Isabel Perón (1974).
The Argentine Constitution does not provide for the replacement of a vice president should their tenure be ended for any reason, and their office was thus made vacant on seventeen occasions since 1861 (see list). 
The 1994 amendments modified the vice president's term—as well as the president's—from one unrenewable six-year term to two four-year terms renewable upon reelection of the joint ticket.
A list of the vice presidents follows, including de facto vice presidents during military regimes and vacant periods. The current vice president of Argentina is Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who previously served as the president of Argentina from 2007 to 2015.

Mahatma Gandhi,"Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948)  was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule. He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (from Sanskrit 'great-souled, venerable'), first applied to him in South Africa in 1914, is now used throughout the world.  
Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple, London, and was called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. It was here that Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination.
Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, and, above all, achieving swaraj or self-rule. Gandhi adopted the short dhoti woven with hand-spun yarn as a mark of identification with India's rural poor. He began to live in a self-sufficient residential community, to eat simple food, and undertake long fasts as a means of both introspection and political protest. Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians, Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi) Dandi Salt March in 1930 and in calling for the British to quit India in 1942. He was imprisoned many times and for many years in both South Africa and India.
Gandhi's vision of an independent India based on religious pluralism was challenged in the early 1940s by a Muslim nationalism which demanded a separate homeland for Muslims within British India. In August 1947, Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two dominions, a Hindu-majority India and a Muslim-majority Pakistan. As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs made their way to their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the Punjab and Bengal. Abstaining from the official celebration of independence, Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to alleviate distress. In the months following, he undertook several hunger strikes to stop the religious violence. The last of these was begun in Delhi on 12 January 1948 when he was 78. The belief that Gandhi had been too resolute in his defense of both Pakistan and Indian Muslims spread among some Hindus in India. Among these was Nathuram Godse, a militant Hindu nationalist from Pune, western India, who assassinated Gandhi by firing three bullets into his chest at an interfaith prayer meeting in Delhi on 30 January 1948. 
Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, is commemorated in India as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday, and worldwide as the International Day of Nonviolence. Gandhi is considered to be the Father of the Nation in post-colonial India. During India's nationalist movement and in several decades immediately after, he was also commonly called Bapu (Gujarati endearment for ""father"", roughly ""papa"", ""daddy"".).


== Early life and background ==
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on 2 October 1869 into a Gujarati Hindu Modh Bania family in Porbandar (also known as Sudamapuri), a coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula and then part of the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the British Raj. His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822–1885), served as the dewan (chief minister) of Porbandar state. His family originated from the then village of Kutiana in what was then Junagadh State.Although he only had been a clerk in the state administration and had an elementary education, Karamchand proved a capable chief minister. During his tenure, he married four times. His first two wives died young, after each had given birth to a daughter, and his third marriage was childless. In 1857, he sought his third wife's permission to remarry; that year, he married Putlibai (1844–1891), who also came from Junagadh, and was from a Pranami Vaishnava family. Karamchand and Putlibai had three children over the ensuing decade: a son, Laxmidas (c. 1860–1914); a daughter, Raliatbehn (1862–1960); and another son, Karsandas (c. 1866–1913).On 2 October 1869, Putlibai gave birth to her last child, Mohandas, in a dark, windowless ground-floor room of the Gandhi family residence in Porbandar city. As a child, Gandhi was described by his sister Raliat as ""restless as mercury, either playing or roaming about. One of his favourite pastimes was twisting dogs' ears."" The Indian classics, especially the stories of Shravana and king Harishchandra, had a great impact on Gandhi in his childhood. In his autobiography, he states that they left an indelible impression on his mind. He writes: ""It haunted me and I must have acted Harishchandra to myself times without number."" Gandhi's early self-identification with truth and love as supreme values is traceable to these epic characters.The family's religious background was eclectic. Gandhi's father Karamchand was Hindu and his mother Putlibai was from a Pranami Vaishnava Hindu family. Gandhi's father was of Modh Baniya caste in the varna of Vaishya. His mother came from the medieval Krishna bhakti-based Pranami tradition, whose religious texts include the Bhagavad Gita, the Bhagavata Purana, and a collection of 14 texts with teachings that the tradition believes to include the essence of the Vedas, the Quran and the Bible. Gandhi was deeply influenced by his mother, an extremely pious lady who ""would not think of taking her meals without her daily prayers... she would take the hardest vows and keep them without flinching. To keep two or three consecutive fasts was nothing to her.""In 1874, Gandhi's father Karamchand left Porbandar for the smaller state of Rajkot, where he became a counsellor to its ruler, the Thakur Sahib; though Rajkot was a less prestigious state than Porbandar, the British regional political agency was located there, which gave the state's diwan a measure of security. In 1876, Karamchand became diwan of Rajkot and was succeeded as diwan of Porbandar by his brother Tulsidas. His family then rejoined him in Rajkot.
At age 9, Gandhi entered the local school in Rajkot, near his home. There, he studied the rudiments of arithmetic, history, the Gujarati language and geography. At the age of 11, he joined the High School in Rajkot, Alfred High School. He was an average student, won some prizes, but was a shy and tongue tied student, with no interest in games; his only companions were books and school lessons.In May 1883, the 13-year-old Mohandas was married to 14-year-old Kasturbai Gokuldas Kapadia (her first name was usually shortened to ""Kasturba"", and affectionately to ""Ba"") in an arranged marriage, according to the custom of the region at that time. In the process, he lost a year at school but was later allowed to make up by accelerating his studies. His wedding was a joint event, where his brother and cousin were also married. Recalling the day of their marriage, he once said, ""As we didn't know much about marriage, for us it meant only wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing with relatives."" As was the prevailing tradition, the adolescent bride was to spend much time at her parents' house, and away from her husband.Writing many years later, Mohandas described with regret the lustful feelings he felt for his young bride: ""even at school I used to think of her, and the thought of nightfall and our subsequent meeting was ever haunting me."" He later recalled feeling jealous and possessive of her, such as when she would visit a temple with her girlfriends, and being sexually lustful in his feelings for her.In late 1885, Gandhi's father Karamchand died. Gandhi, then 16 years old, and his wife of age 17 had their first baby, who survived only a few days. The two deaths anguished Gandhi. The Gandhi couple had four more children, all sons: Harilal, born in 1888; Manilal, born in 1892; Ramdas, born in 1897; and Devdas, born in 1900.In November 1887, the 18-year-old Gandhi graduated from high school in Ahmedabad. In January 1888, he enrolled at Samaldas College in Bhavnagar State, then the sole degree-granting institution of higher education in the region. However, he dropped out, and returned to his family in Porbandar.


== Three years in London ==


=== Student of law ===
Gandhi had dropped out of the cheapest college he could afford in Bombay. Mavji Dave Joshiji, a Brahmin priest and family friend, advised Gandhi and his family that he should consider law studies in London. In July 1888, his wife Kasturba gave birth to their first surviving son, Harilal. His mother was not comfortable about Gandhi leaving his wife and family, and going so far from home. Gandhi's uncle Tulsidas also tried to dissuade his nephew. Gandhi wanted to go. To persuade his wife and mother, Gandhi made a vow in front of his mother that he would abstain from meat, alcohol and women. Gandhi's brother Laxmidas, who was already a lawyer, cheered Gandhi's London studies plan and offered to support him. Putlibai gave Gandhi her permission and blessing.
On 10 August 1888, Gandhi aged 18, left Porbandar for Mumbai, then known as Bombay. Upon arrival, he stayed with the local Modh Bania community whose elders warned him that England would tempt him to compromise his religion, and eat and drink in Western ways. Despite Gandhi informing them of his promise to his mother and her blessings, he was excommunicated from his caste. Gandhi ignored this, and on 4 September, he sailed from Bombay to London, with his brother seeing him off. Gandhi attended University College, London, where he took classes in English literature with Henry Morley in 1888–1889.He also enrolled at the Inns of Court School of Law in Inner Temple with the intention of becoming a barrister. His childhood shyness and self-withdrawal had continued through his teens. He retained these traits when he arrived in London, but joined a public speaking practice group and overcame his shyness sufficiently to practise law.He demonstrated a keen interest in the welfare of London's impoverished dockland communities. In 1889, a bitter trade dispute broke out in London, with dockers striking for better pay and conditions, and seamen, shipbuilders, factory girls and other joining the strike in solidarity. The strikers were successful, in part due to the mediation of Cardinal Manning, leading Gandhi and an Indian friend to make a point of visiting the cardinal and thanking him for his work.


=== Vegetarianism and committee work ===
Gandhi's time in London was influenced by the vow he had made to his mother. He tried to adopt ""English"" customs, including taking dancing lessons. However, he did not appreciate the bland vegetarian food offered by his landlady and was frequently hungry until he found one of London's few vegetarian restaurants. Influenced by Henry Salt's writing, he joined the London Vegetarian Society, and was elected to its executive committee under the aegis of its president and benefactor Arnold Hills. An achievement while on the committee was the establishment of a Bayswater chapter. Some of the vegetarians he met were members of the Theosophical Society, which had been founded in 1875 to further universal brotherhood, and which was devoted to the study of Buddhist and Hindu literature. They encouraged Gandhi to join them in reading the Bhagavad Gita both in translation as well as in the original.Gandhi had a friendly and productive relationship with Hills, but the two men took a different view on the continued LVS membership of fellow committee member Thomas Allinson. Their disagreement is the first known example of Gandhi challenging authority, despite his shyness and temperamental disinclination towards confrontation.
Allinson had been promoting newly available birth control methods, but Hills disapproved of these, believing they undermined public morality. He believed vegetarianism to be a moral movement and that Allinson should therefore no longer remain a member of the LVS. Gandhi shared Hills' views on the dangers of birth control, but defended Allinson's right to differ. It would have been hard for Gandhi to challenge Hills; Hills was 12 years his senior and unlike Gandhi, highly eloquent. He bankrolled the LVS and was a captain of industry with his Thames Ironworks company employing more than 6,000 people in the East End of London. He was also a highly accomplished sportsman who later founded the football club West Ham United. In his 1927 An Autobiography, Vol. I, Gandhi wrote:

 The question deeply interested me...I had a high regard for Mr. Hills and his generosity. But I thought it was quite improper to exclude a man from a vegetarian society simply because he refused to regard puritan morals as one of the objects of the society
A motion to remove Allinson was raised, and was debated and voted on by the committee. Gandhi's shyness was an obstacle to his defence of Allinson at the committee meeting. He wrote his views down on paper but shyness prevented him from reading out his arguments, so Hills, the President, asked another committee member to read them out for him. Although some other members of the committee agreed with Gandhi, the vote was lost and Allinson excluded. There were no hard feelings, with Hills proposing the toast at the LVS farewell dinner in honour of Gandhi's return to India.


=== Called to the bar ===
Gandhi, at age 22, was called to the bar in June 1891 and then left London for India, where he learned that his mother had died while he was in London and that his family had kept the news from him. His attempts at establishing a law practice in Bombay failed because he was psychologically unable to cross-examine witnesses. He returned to Rajkot to make a modest living drafting petitions for litigants, but he was forced to stop when he ran afoul of British officer Sam Sunny.In 1893, a Muslim merchant in Kathiawar named Dada Abdullah contacted Gandhi. Abdullah owned a large successful shipping business in South Africa. His distant cousin in Johannesburg needed a lawyer, and they preferred someone with Kathiawari heritage. Gandhi inquired about his pay for the work. They offered a total salary of £105 (~$4,143.31 2023 money) plus travel expenses. He accepted it, knowing that it would be at least a one-year commitment in the Colony of Natal, South Africa, also a part of the British Empire.


== Civil rights activist in South Africa (1893–1914) ==
In April 1893, Gandhi aged 23, set sail for South Africa to be the lawyer for Abdullah's cousin. He spent 21 years in South Africa, where he developed his political views, ethics and politics.Immediately upon arriving in South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination because of his skin colour and heritage. He was not allowed to sit with European passengers in the stagecoach and told to sit on the floor near the driver, then beaten when he refused; elsewhere he was kicked into a gutter for daring to walk near a house, in another instance thrown off a train at Pietermaritzburg after refusing to leave the first-class. He sat in the train station, shivering all night and pondering if he should return to India or protest for his rights. He chose to protest and was allowed to board the train the next day. In another incident, the magistrate of a Durban court ordered Gandhi to remove his turban, which he refused to do. Indians were not allowed to walk on public footpaths in South Africa. Gandhi was kicked by a police officer out of the footpath onto the street without warning.When Gandhi arrived in South Africa, according to Herman, he thought of himself as ""a Briton first, and an Indian second"". However, the prejudice against him and his fellow Indians from British people that Gandhi experienced and observed deeply bothered him. He found it humiliating, struggling to understand how some people can feel honour or superiority or pleasure in such inhumane practices. Gandhi began to question his people's standing in the British Empire.The Abdullah case that had brought him to South Africa concluded in May 1894, and the Indian community organised a farewell party for Gandhi as he prepared to return to India. However, a new Natal government discriminatory proposal led to Gandhi extending his original period of stay in South Africa. He planned to assist Indians in opposing a bill to deny them the right to vote, a right then proposed to be an exclusive European right. He asked Joseph Chamberlain, the British Colonial Secretary, to reconsider his position on this bill. Though unable to halt the bill's passage, his campaign was successful in drawing attention to the grievances of Indians in South Africa. He helped found the Natal Indian Congress in 1894, and through this organisation, he moulded the Indian community of South Africa into a unified political force. In January 1897, when Gandhi landed in Durban, a mob of white settlers attacked him and he escaped only through the efforts of the wife of the police superintendent. However, he refused to press charges against any member of the mob.
During the Boer War, Gandhi volunteered in 1900 to form a group of stretcher-bearers as the Natal Indian Ambulance Corps. According to Arthur Herman, Gandhi wanted to disprove the British colonial stereotype that Hindus were not fit for ""manly"" activities involving danger and exertion, unlike the Muslim ""martial races"". Gandhi raised eleven hundred Indian volunteers, to support British combat troops against the Boers. They were trained and medically certified to serve on the front lines. They were auxiliaries at the Battle of Colenso to a White volunteer ambulance corps. At the battle of Spion Kop Gandhi and his bearers moved to the front line and had to carry wounded soldiers for miles to a field hospital because the terrain was too rough for the ambulances. Gandhi and thirty-seven other Indians received the Queen's South Africa Medal.
In 1906, the Transvaal government promulgated a new Act compelling registration of the colony's Indian and Chinese populations. At a mass protest meeting held in Johannesburg on 11 September that year, Gandhi adopted his still evolving methodology of Satyagraha (devotion to the truth), or nonviolent protest, for the first time. According to Anthony Parel, Gandhi was also influenced by the Tamil moral text Tirukkuṛaḷ after Leo Tolstoy mentioned it in their correspondence that began with ""A Letter to a Hindu"". Gandhi urged Indians to defy the new law and to suffer the punishments for doing so. Gandhi's ideas of protests, persuasion skills and public relations had emerged. He took these back to India in 1915.


=== Europeans, Indians and Africans ===
Gandhi focused his attention on Indians and Africans while he was in South Africa. He initially was not interested in politics. This changed, however, after he was discriminated against and bullied, such as by being thrown out of a train coach because of his skin colour by a white train official. After several such incidents with Whites in South Africa, Gandhi's thinking and focus changed, and he felt he must resist this and fight for rights. He entered politics by forming the Natal Indian Congress. According to Ashwin Desai and Goolam Vahed, Gandhi's views on racism are contentious in some cases, but that changed afterward. Gandhi suffered persecution from the beginning in South Africa. Like with other coloured people, white officials denied him his rights, and the press and those in the streets bullied and called him a ""parasite"", ""semi-barbarous"", ""canker"", ""squalid coolie"", ""yellow man"", and other epithets. People would spit on him as an expression of racial hate.
While in South Africa, Gandhi focused on the racial persecution of Indians before he started to focus on racism against Africans. In some cases, state Desai and Vahed, his behaviour was one of being a willing part of racial stereotyping and African exploitation. During a speech in September 1896, Gandhi complained that the whites in the British colony of South Africa were ""degrading the Indian to the level of a raw Kaffir"". Scholars cite it as an example of evidence that Gandhi at that time thought of Indians and black South Africans differently. As another example given by Herman, Gandhi, at age 24, prepared a legal brief for the Natal Assembly in 1895, seeking voting rights for Indians. Gandhi cited race history and European Orientalists' opinions that ""Anglo-Saxons and Indians are sprung from the same Aryan stock or rather the Indo-European peoples"", and argued that Indians should not be grouped with the Africans.Years later, Gandhi and his colleagues served and helped Africans as nurses and by opposing racism. The Nobel Peace Prize winner Nelson Mandela is among admirers of Gandhi's efforts to fight against racism in Africa. The general image of Gandhi, state Desai and Vahed, has been reinvented since his assassination as if he was always a saint when in reality his life was more complex, contained inconvenient truths and was one that changed over time. Scholars have also pointed the evidence to a rich history of co-operation and efforts by Gandhi and Indian people with nonwhite South Africans against persecution of Africans and the Apartheid.In 1906, when the Bambatha Rebellion broke out in the colony of Natal, then 36-year-old Gandhi, despite sympathising with the Zulu rebels encouraged Indian South Africans to form a volunteer stretcher-bearer unit. Writing in the Indian Opinion, Gandhi argued that military service would be beneficial to the Indian community and claimed it would give them ""health and happiness."" Gandhi eventually led a volunteer mixed unit of Indian and African stretcher-bearers to treat wounded combatants during the suppression of the rebellion.
The medical unit commanded by Gandhi operated for less than two months before being disbanded. After the suppression of the rebellion, the colonial establishment showed no interest in extending to the Indian community the civil rights granted to white South Africans. This led Gandhi to becoming disillusioned with the Empire and aroused a spiritual awakening with him; historian Arthur L. Herman wrote that his African experience was a part of his great disillusionment with the West, transforming him into an ""uncompromising non-cooperator"".By 1910, Gandhi's newspaper, Indian Opinion, was covering reports on discrimination against Africans by the colonial regime. Gandhi remarked that the Africans are ""alone are the original inhabitants of the land. … The whites, on the other hand, have occupied the land forcibly and appropriated it to themselves.""In 1910, Gandhi established, with the help of his friend Hermann Kallenbach, an idealistic community they named Tolstoy Farm near Johannesburg. There he nurtured his policy of peaceful resistance.In the years after black South Africans gained the right to vote in South Africa (1994), Gandhi was proclaimed a national hero with numerous monuments.


== Struggle for Indian independence (1915–1947) ==

At the request of Gopal Krishna Gokhale, conveyed to him by C. F. Andrews, Gandhi returned to India in 1915. He brought an international reputation as a leading Indian nationalist, theorist and community organiser.
Gandhi joined the Indian National Congress and was introduced to Indian issues, politics and the Indian people primarily by Gokhale. Gokhale was a key leader of the Congress Party best known for his restraint and moderation, and his insistence on working inside the system. Gandhi took Gokhale's liberal approach based on British Whiggish traditions and transformed it to make it look Indian.Gandhi took leadership of the Congress in 1920 and began escalating demands until on 26 January 1930 the Indian National Congress declared the independence of India. The British did not recognise the declaration but negotiations ensued, with the Congress taking a role in provincial government in the late 1930s. Gandhi and the Congress withdrew their support of the Raj when the Viceroy declared war on Germany in September 1939 without consultation. Tensions escalated until Gandhi demanded immediate independence in 1942 and the British responded by imprisoning him and tens of thousands of Congress leaders. Meanwhile, the Muslim League did co-operate with Britain and moved, against Gandhi's strong opposition, to demands for a totally separate Muslim state of Pakistan. In August 1947 the British partitioned the land with India and Pakistan each achieving independence on terms that Gandhi disapproved.


=== Role in World War I ===

In April 1918, during the latter part of World War I, the Viceroy invited Gandhi to a War Conference in Delhi. Gandhi agreed to actively recruit Indians for the war effort. In contrast to the Zulu War of 1906 and the outbreak of World War I in 1914, when he recruited volunteers for the Ambulance Corps, this time Gandhi attempted to recruit combatants. In a June 1918 leaflet entitled ""Appeal for Enlistment"", Gandhi wrote ""To bring about such a state of things we should have the ability to defend ourselves, that is, the ability to bear arms and to use them... If we want to learn the use of arms with the greatest possible despatch, it is our duty to enlist ourselves in the army."" He did, however, stipulate in a letter to the Viceroy's private secretary that he ""personally will not kill or injure anybody, friend or foe.""Gandhi's war recruitment campaign brought into question his consistency on nonviolence. Gandhi's private secretary noted that ""The question of the consistency between his creed of 'Ahimsa' (nonviolence) and his recruiting campaign was raised not only then but has been discussed ever since.""In July 1918, Gandhi admitted that he couldn't persuade even one individual to enlist for the world war. ""So far I have not a single recruit to my credit apart,"" Gandhi wrote. He added: ""They object because they fear to die.""


=== Champaran agitations ===

Gandhi's first major achievement came in 1917 with the Champaran agitation in Bihar. The Champaran agitation pitted the local peasantry against largely Anglo-Indian plantation owners who were backed by the local administration. The peasants were forced to grow indigo (Indigofera sp.), a cash crop for Indigo dye whose demand had been declining over two decades, and were forced to sell their crops to the planters at a fixed price. Unhappy with this, the peasantry appealed to Gandhi at his ashram in Ahmedabad. Pursuing a strategy of nonviolent protest, Gandhi took the administration by surprise and won concessions from the authorities.


=== Kheda agitations ===

In 1918, Kheda was hit by floods and famine and the peasantry was demanding relief from taxes. Gandhi moved his headquarters to Nadiad, organising scores of supporters and fresh volunteers from the region, the most notable being Vallabhbhai Patel. Using non-co-operation as a technique, Gandhi initiated a signature campaign where peasants pledged non-payment of revenue even under the threat of confiscation of land. A social boycott of mamlatdars and talatdars (revenue officials within the district) accompanied the agitation. Gandhi worked hard to win public support for the agitation across the country. For five months, the administration refused, but by the end of May 1918, the Government gave way on important provisions and relaxed the conditions of payment of revenue tax until the famine ended. In Kheda, Vallabhbhai Patel represented the farmers in negotiations with the British, who suspended revenue collection and released all the prisoners.


=== Khilafat movement ===

In 1919, following World War I, Gandhi (aged 49) sought political co-operation from Muslims in his fight against British imperialism by supporting the Ottoman Empire that had been defeated in the World War. Before this initiative of Gandhi, communal disputes and religious riots between Hindus and Muslims were common in British India, such as the riots of 1917–18. Gandhi had already supported the British crown with resources and by recruiting Indian soldiers to fight the war in Europe on the British side. This effort of Gandhi was in part motivated by the British promise to reciprocate the help with swaraj (self-government) to Indians after the end of World War I. The British government, instead of self government, had offered minor reforms instead, disappointing Gandhi. Gandhi announced his satyagraha (civil disobedience) intentions. The British colonial officials made their counter move by passing the Rowlatt Act, to block Gandhi's movement. The Act allowed the British government to treat civil disobedience participants as criminals and gave it the legal basis to arrest anyone for ""preventive indefinite detention, incarceration without judicial review or any need for a trial"".Gandhi felt that Hindu-Muslim co-operation was necessary for political progress against the British. He leveraged the Khilafat movement, wherein Sunni Muslims in India, their leaders such as the sultans of princely states in India and Ali brothers championed the Turkish Caliph as a solidarity symbol of Sunni Islamic community (ummah). They saw the Caliph as their means to support Islam and the Islamic law after the defeat of Ottoman Empire in World War I. Gandhi's support to the Khilafat movement led to mixed results. It initially led to a strong Muslim support for Gandhi. However, the Hindu leaders including Rabindranath Tagore questioned Gandhi's leadership because they were largely against recognising or supporting the Sunni Islamic Caliph in Turkey.The increasing Muslim support for Gandhi, after he championed the Caliph's cause, temporarily stopped the Hindu-Muslim communal violence. It offered evidence of inter-communal harmony in joint Rowlatt satyagraha demonstration rallies, raising Gandhi's stature as the political leader to the British. His support for the Khilafat movement also helped him sideline Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who had announced his opposition to the satyagraha non-co-operation movement approach of Gandhi. Jinnah began creating his independent support, and later went on to lead the demand for West and East Pakistan. Though they agreed in general terms on Indian independence, they disagreed on the means of achieving this. Jinnah was mainly interested in dealing with the British via constitutional negotiation, rather than attempting to agitate the masses.In 1922 the Khilafat movement gradually collapsed following the end of the non-cooperation movement with the arrest of Gandhi. A number of Muslim leaders and delegates abandoned Gandhi and Congress. Hindu-Muslim communal conflicts reignited. Deadly religious riots re-appeared in numerous cities, with 91 in United Provinces of Agra and Oudh alone.


=== Non-co-operation ===

With his book Hind Swaraj (1909) Gandhi, aged 40, declared that British rule was established in India with the co-operation of Indians and had survived only because of this co-operation. If Indians refused to co-operate, British rule would collapse and swaraj (Indian independence) would come.
In February 1919, Gandhi cautioned the Viceroy of India with a cable communication that if the British were to pass the Rowlatt Act, he would appeal to Indians to start civil disobedience. The British government ignored him and passed the law, stating it would not yield to threats. The satyagraha civil disobedience followed, with people assembling to protest the Rowlatt Act. On 30 March 1919, British law officers opened fire on an assembly of unarmed people, peacefully gathered, participating in satyagraha in Delhi.People rioted in retaliation. On 6 April 1919, a Hindu festival day, he asked a crowd to remember not to injure or kill British people, but to express their frustration with peace, to boycott British goods and burn any British clothing they owned. He emphasised the use of non-violence to the British and towards each other, even if the other side used violence. Communities across India announced plans to gather in greater numbers to protest. Government warned him to not enter Delhi. Gandhi defied the order. On 9 April, Gandhi was arrested.People rioted. On 13 April 1919, people including women with children gathered in an Amritsar park, and British Indian Army officer Reginald Dyer surrounded them and ordered troops under his command to fire on them. The resulting Jallianwala Bagh massacre (or Amritsar massacre) of hundreds of Sikh and Hindu civilians enraged the subcontinent, but was supported by some Britons and parts of the British media as a necessary response. Gandhi in Ahmedabad, on the day after the massacre in Amritsar, did not criticise the British and instead criticised his fellow countrymen for not exclusively using 'love' to deal with the 'hate' of the British government. Gandhi demanded that the Indian people stop all violence, stop all property destruction, and went on fast-to-death to pressure Indians to stop their rioting.The massacre and Gandhi's non-violent response to it moved many, but also made some Sikhs and Hindus upset that Dyer was getting away with murder. Investigation committees were formed by the British, which Gandhi asked Indians to boycott. The unfolding events, the massacre and the British response, led Gandhi to the belief that Indians will never get a fair equal treatment under British rulers, and he shifted his attention to swaraj and political independence for India. In 1921, Gandhi was the leader of the Indian National Congress. He reorganised the Congress. With Congress now behind him, and Muslim support triggered by his backing the Khilafat movement to restore the Caliph in Turkey, Gandhi had the political support and the attention of the British Raj.
Gandhi expanded his nonviolent non-co-operation platform to include the swadeshi policy – the boycott of foreign-made goods, especially British goods. Linked to this was his advocacy that khadi (homespun cloth) be worn by all Indians instead of British-made textiles. Gandhi exhorted Indian men and women, rich or poor, to spend time each day spinning khadi in support of the independence movement. In addition to boycotting British products, Gandhi urged the people to boycott British institutions and law courts, to resign from government employment, and to forsake British titles and honours. Gandhi thus began his journey aimed at crippling the British India government economically, politically and administratively.The appeal of ""Non-cooperation"" grew, its social popularity drew participation from all strata of Indian society. Gandhi was arrested on 10 March 1922, tried for sedition, and sentenced to six years' imprisonment. He began his sentence on 18 March 1922. With Gandhi isolated in prison, the Indian National Congress split into two factions, one led by Chitta Ranjan Das and Motilal Nehru favouring party participation in the legislatures, and the other led by Chakravarti Rajagopalachari and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, opposing this move. Furthermore, co-operation among Hindus and Muslims ended as Khilafat movement collapsed with the rise of Atatürk in Turkey. Muslim leaders left the Congress and began forming Muslim organisations. The political base behind Gandhi had broken into factions. Gandhi was released in February 1924 for an appendicitis operation, having served only two years.


=== Salt Satyagraha (Salt March) ===

After his early release from prison for political crimes in 1924, over the second half of the 1920s Gandhi continued to pursue swaraj. He pushed through a resolution at the Calcutta Congress in December 1928 calling on the British government to grant India dominion status or face a new campaign of non-cooperation with complete independence for the country as its goal. After his support for World War I with Indian combat troops, and the failure of Khilafat movement in preserving the rule of Caliph in Turkey, followed by a collapse in Muslim support for his leadership, some such as Subhas Chandra Bose and Bhagat Singh questioned his values and non-violent approach. While many Hindu leaders championed a demand for immediate independence, Gandhi revised his own call to a one-year wait, instead of two.The British did not respond favourably to Gandhi's proposal. British political leaders such as Lord Birkenhead and Winston Churchill announced opposition to ""the appeasers of Gandhi"" in their discussions with European diplomats who sympathised with Indian demands. On 31 December 1929, an Indian flag was unfurled in Lahore. Gandhi led Congress in a celebration on 26 January 1930 of India's Independence Day in Lahore. This day was commemorated by almost every other Indian organisation. Gandhi then launched a new Satyagraha against the British salt tax in March 1930. Gandhi sent an ultimatum in the form of a letter personally addressed to Lord Irwin, the viceroy of India, on 2 March. Gandhi condemned British rule in the letter, describing it as ""a curse"" that ""has impoverished the dumb millions by a system of progressive exploitation and by a ruinously expensive military and civil administration...It has reduced us politically to serfdom."" Gandhi also mentioned in the letter that the viceroy received a salary ""over five thousand times India's average income."" In the letter, Gandhi also stressed his continued adherence to non-violent forms of protest.This was highlighted by the Salt March to Dandi from 12 March to 6 April, where, together with 78 volunteers, he marched 388 kilometres (241 mi) from Ahmedabad to Dandi, Gujarat to make salt himself, with the declared intention of breaking the salt laws. The march took 25 days to cover 240 miles with Gandhi speaking to often huge crowds along the way. Thousands of Indians joined him in Dandi. On 5 May he was interned under a regulation dating from 1827 in anticipation of a protest that he had planned. The protest at Dharasana salt works on 21 May went ahead without him see. A horrified American journalist, Webb Miller, described the British response thus:

In complete silence the Gandhi men drew up and halted a hundred yards from the stockade. A picked column advanced from the crowd, waded the ditches and approached the barbed wire stockade... at a word of command, scores of native policemen rushed upon the advancing marchers and rained blows on their heads with their steel-shot lathis [long bamboo sticks]. Not one of the marchers even raised an arm to fend off blows. They went down like ninepins. From where I stood I heard the sickening whack of the clubs on unprotected skulls... Those struck down fell sprawling, unconscious or writhing with fractured skulls or broken shoulders.
This went on for hours until some 300 or more protesters had been beaten, many seriously injured and two killed. At no time did they offer any resistance.
This campaign was one of his most successful at upsetting British hold on India; Britain responded by imprisoning over 60,000 people. Congress estimates, however, put the figure at 90,000. Among them was one of Gandhi's lieutenants, Jawaharlal Nehru.
According to Sarma, Gandhi recruited women to participate in the salt tax campaigns and the boycott of foreign products, which gave many women a new self-confidence and dignity in the mainstream of Indian public life. However, other scholars such as Marilyn French state that Gandhi barred women from joining his civil disobedience movement because he feared he would be accused of using women as a political shield. When women insisted on joining the movement and participating in public demonstrations, Gandhi asked the volunteers to get permissions of their guardians and only those women who can arrange child-care should join him. Regardless of Gandhi's apprehensions and views, Indian women joined the Salt March by the thousands to defy the British salt taxes and monopoly on salt mining. After Gandhi's arrest, the women marched and picketed shops on their own, accepting violence and verbal abuse from British authorities for the cause in the manner Gandhi inspired.


=== Gandhi as folk hero ===
Indian Congress in the 1920s appealed to Andhra Pradesh peasants by creating Telugu language plays that combined Indian mythology and legends, linked them to Gandhi's ideas, and portrayed Gandhi as a messiah, a reincarnation of ancient and medieval Indian nationalist leaders and saints. The plays built support among peasants steeped in traditional Hindu culture, according to Murali, and this effort made Gandhi a folk hero in Telugu speaking villages, a sacred messiah-like figure.According to Dennis Dalton, it was Gandhi's ideas that were responsible for his wide following. Gandhi criticised Western civilisation as one driven by ""brute force and immorality"", contrasting it with his categorisation of Indian civilisation as one driven by ""soul force and morality"". Gandhi captured the imagination of the people of his heritage with his ideas about winning ""hate with love"". These ideas are evidenced in his pamphlets from the 1890s, in South Africa, where too he was popular among the Indian indentured workers. After he returned to India, people flocked to him because he reflected their values.
Gandhi also campaigned hard going from one rural corner of the Indian subcontinent to another. He used terminology and phrases such as Rama-rajya from Ramayana, Prahlada as a paradigmatic icon, and such cultural symbols as another facet of swaraj and satyagraha. During his lifetime, these ideas sounded strange outside India, but they readily and deeply resonated with the culture and historic values of his people.


=== Negotiations ===
The government, represented by Lord Irwin, decided to negotiate with Gandhi. The Gandhi–Irwin Pact was signed in March 1931. The British Government agreed to free all political prisoners, in return for the suspension of the civil disobedience movement. According to the pact, Gandhi was invited to attend the Round Table Conference in London for discussions and as the sole representative of the Indian National Congress. The conference was a disappointment to Gandhi and the nationalists. Gandhi expected to discuss India's independence, while the British side focused on the Indian princes and Indian minorities rather than on a transfer of power. Lord Irwin's successor, Lord Willingdon, took a hard line against India as an independent nation, began a new campaign of controlling and subduing the nationalist movement. Gandhi was again arrested, and the government tried and failed to negate his influence by completely isolating him from his followers.In Britain, Winston Churchill, a prominent Conservative politician who was then out of office but later became its prime minister, became a vigorous and articulate critic of Gandhi and opponent of his long-term plans. Churchill often ridiculed Gandhi, saying in a widely reported 1931 speech:

It is alarming and also nauseating to see Mr Gandhi, a seditious Middle Temple lawyer, now posing as a fakir of a type well known in the East, striding half-naked up the steps of the Vice-regal palace....to parley on equal terms with the representative of the King-Emperor.
Churchill's bitterness against Gandhi grew in the 1930s. He called Gandhi as the one who was ""seditious in aim"" whose evil genius and multiform menace was attacking the British empire. Churchill called him a dictator, a ""Hindu Mussolini"", fomenting a race war, trying to replace the Raj with Brahmin cronies, playing on the ignorance of Indian masses, all for selfish gain. Churchill attempted to isolate Gandhi, and his criticism of Gandhi was widely covered by European and American press. It gained Churchill sympathetic support, but it also increased support for Gandhi among Europeans. The developments heightened Churchill's anxiety that the ""British themselves would give up out of pacifism and misplaced conscience"".


=== Round Table Conferences ===
During the discussions between Gandhi and the British government over 1931–32 at the Round Table Conferences, Gandhi, now aged about 62, sought constitutional reforms as a preparation to the end of colonial British rule, and begin the self-rule by Indians. The British side sought reforms that would keep the Indian subcontinent as a colony. The British negotiators proposed constitutional reforms on a British Dominion model that established separate electorates based on religious and social divisions. The British questioned the Congress party and Gandhi's authority to speak for all of India. They invited Indian religious leaders, such as Muslims and Sikhs, to press their demands along religious lines, as well as B. R. Ambedkar as the representative leader of the untouchables. Gandhi vehemently opposed a constitution that enshrined rights or representations based on communal divisions, because he feared that it would not bring people together but divide them, perpetuate their status, and divert the attention from India's struggle to end the colonial rule.The Second Round Table conference was the only time he left India between 1914 and his death in 1948. He declined the government's offer of accommodation in an expensive West End hotel, preferring to stay in the East End, to live among working-class people, as he did in India. He based himself in a small cell-bedroom at Kingsley Hall for the three-month duration of his stay and was enthusiastically received by East Enders. During this time he renewed his links with the British vegetarian movement.

After Gandhi returned from the Second Round Table conference, he started a new satyagraha. He was arrested and imprisoned at the Yerwada Jail, Pune. While he was in prison, the British government enacted a new law that granted untouchables a separate electorate. It came to be known as the Communal Award. In protest, Gandhi started a fast-unto-death, while he was held in prison. The resulting public outcry forced the government, in consultations with Ambedkar, to replace the Communal Award with a compromise Poona Pact.


=== Congress politics ===
In 1934 Gandhi resigned from Congress party membership. He did not disagree with the party's position but felt that if he resigned, his popularity with Indians would cease to stifle the party's membership, which actually varied, including communists, socialists, trade unionists, students, religious conservatives, and those with pro-business convictions, and that these various voices would get a chance to make themselves heard. Gandhi also wanted to avoid being a target for Raj propaganda by leading a party that had temporarily accepted political accommodation with the Raj.Gandhi returned to active politics again in 1936, with the Nehru presidency and the Lucknow session of the Congress. Although Gandhi wanted a total focus on the task of winning independence and not speculation about India's future, he did not restrain the Congress from adopting socialism as its goal. Gandhi had a clash with Subhas Chandra Bose, who had been elected president in 1938, and who had previously expressed a lack of faith in nonviolence as a means of protest. Despite Gandhi's opposition, Bose won a second term as Congress President, against Gandhi's nominee, Bhogaraju Pattabhi Sitaramayya. Gandhi declared that Sitaramayya's defeat was his defeat. Bose later left the Congress when the All-India leaders resigned en masse in protest of his abandonment of the principles introduced by Gandhi.


=== World War II and Quit India movement ===

Gandhi opposed providing any help to the British war effort and he campaigned against any Indian participation in World War II. The British government responded with the arrests of Gandhi and many other Congress leaders and killed over 1,000 Indians who participated in this movement. A number of violent attacks were also carried out by the nationalists against the British government. While Gandhi's campaign did not enjoy the support of a number of Indian leaders, and over 2.5 million Indians volunteered and joined the British military to fight on various fronts of the Allied Forces, the movement played a role in weakening the control over the South Asian region by the British regime and it ultimately paved the way for Indian independence.Gandhi's opposition to the Indian participation in World War II was motivated by his belief that India could not be party to a war ostensibly being fought for democratic freedom while that freedom was denied to India itself. He also condemned Nazism and Fascism, a view which won endorsement of other Indian leaders. As the war progressed, Gandhi intensified his demand for independence, calling for the British to Quit India in a 1942 speech in Mumbai. This was Gandhi's and the Congress Party's most definitive revolt aimed at securing the British exit from India. The British government responded quickly to the Quit India speech, and within hours after Gandhi's speech arrested Gandhi and all the members of the Congress Working Committee. His countrymen retaliated the arrests by damaging or burning down hundreds of government owned railway stations, police stations, and cutting down telegraph wires.In 1942, Gandhi now nearing age 73, urged his people to completely stop co-operating with the imperial government. In this effort, he urged that they neither kill nor injure British people, but be willing to suffer and die if violence is initiated by the British officials. He clarified that the movement would not be stopped because of any individual acts of violence, saying that the ""ordered anarchy"" of ""the present system of administration"" was ""worse than real anarchy."" He urged Indians to karo ya maro (""do or die"") in the cause of their rights and freedoms.
Gandhi's arrest lasted two years, as he was held in the Aga Khan Palace in Pune. During this period, his long time secretary Mahadev Desai died of a heart attack, his wife Kasturba died after 18 months' imprisonment on 22 February 1944; and Gandhi suffered a severe malaria attack. While in jail, he agreed to an interview with Stuart Gelder, a British journalist. Gelder then composed and released an interview summary, cabled it to the mainstream press, that announced sudden concessions Gandhi was willing to make, comments that shocked his countrymen, the Congress workers and even Gandhi. The latter two claimed that it distorted what Gandhi actually said on a range of topics and falsely repudiated the Quit India movement.Gandhi was released before the end of the war on 6 May 1944 because of his failing health and necessary surgery; the Raj did not want him to die in prison and enrage the nation. He came out of detention to an altered political scene – the Muslim League for example, which a few years earlier had appeared marginal, ""now occupied the centre of the political stage"" and the topic of Jinnah's campaign for Pakistan was a major talking point. Gandhi and Jinnah had extensive correspondence and the two men met several times over a period of two weeks in September 1944 at Jinnah's house in Bombay, where Gandhi insisted on a united religiously plural and independent India which included Muslims and non-Muslims of the Indian subcontinent coexisting. Jinnah rejected this proposal and insisted instead for partitioning the subcontinent on religious lines to create a separate Muslim homeland (later Pakistan). These discussions continued through 1947.While the leaders of Congress languished in jail, the other parties supported the war and gained organisational strength. Underground publications flailed at the ruthless suppression of Congress, but it had little control over events. At the end of the war, the British gave clear indications that power would be transferred to Indian hands. At this point Gandhi called off the struggle, and around 100,000 political prisoners were released, including the Congress's leadership.


=== Partition and independence ===

Gandhi opposed the partition of the Indian subcontinent along religious lines. The Indian National Congress and Gandhi called for the British to Quit India. However, the All-India Muslim League demanded ""Divide and Quit India"". Gandhi suggested an agreement which required the Congress and the Muslim League to co-operate and attain independence under a provisional government, thereafter, the question of partition could be resolved by a plebiscite in the districts with a Muslim majority.Jinnah rejected Gandhi's proposal and called for Direct Action Day, on 16 August 1946, to press Muslims to publicly gather in cities and support his proposal for the partition of the Indian subcontinent into a Muslim state and non-Muslim state. Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, the Muslim League Chief Minister of Bengal – now Bangladesh and West Bengal, gave Calcutta's police special holiday to celebrate the Direct Action Day. The Direct Action Day triggered a mass murder of Calcutta Hindus and the torching of their property, and holidaying police were missing to contain or stop the conflict. The British government did not order its army to move in to contain the violence. The violence on Direct Action Day led to retaliatory violence against Muslims across India. Thousands of Hindus and Muslims were murdered, and tens of thousands were injured in the cycle of violence in the days that followed. Gandhi visited the most riot-prone areas to appeal a stop to the massacres.
Archibald Wavell, the Viceroy and Governor-General of British India for three years through February 1947, had worked with Gandhi and Jinnah to find a common ground, before and after accepting Indian independence in principle. Wavell condemned Gandhi's character and motives as well as his ideas. Wavell accused Gandhi of harbouring the single minded idea to ""overthrow British rule and influence and to establish a Hindu raj"", and called Gandhi a ""malignant, malevolent, exceedingly shrewd"" politician. Wavell feared a civil war on the Indian subcontinent, and doubted Gandhi would be able to stop it.The British reluctantly agreed to grant independence to the people of the Indian subcontinent, but accepted Jinnah's proposal of partitioning the land into Pakistan and India. Gandhi was involved in the final negotiations, but Stanley Wolpert states the ""plan to carve up British India was never approved of or accepted by Gandhi"".The partition was controversial and violently disputed. More than half a million were killed in religious riots as 10 million to 12 million non-Muslims (Hindus and Sikhs mostly) migrated from Pakistan into India, and Muslims migrated from India into Pakistan, across the newly created borders of India, West Pakistan and East Pakistan.Gandhi spent the day of independence not celebrating the end of the British rule but appealing for peace among his countrymen by fasting and spinning in Calcutta on 15 August 1947. The partition had gripped the Indian subcontinent with religious violence and the streets were filled with corpses. Gandhi's fasting and protests are credited for stopping the religious riots and communal violence.


== Death ==

At 5:17 pm on 30 January 1948, Gandhi was with his grandnieces in the garden of Birla House (now Gandhi Smriti), on his way to address a prayer meeting, when Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, fired three bullets into his chest from a pistol at close range. According to some accounts, Gandhi died instantly. In other accounts, such as one prepared by an eyewitness journalist, Gandhi was carried into the Birla House, into a bedroom. There he died about 30 minutes later as one of Gandhi's family members read verses from Hindu scriptures.Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru addressed his countrymen over the All-India Radio saying:
Friends and comrades, the light has gone out of our lives, and there is darkness everywhere, and I do not quite know what to tell you or how to say it. Our beloved leader, Bapu as we called him, the father of the nation, is no more. Perhaps I am wrong to say that; nevertheless, we will not see him again, as we have seen him for these many years, we will not run to him for advice or seek solace from him, and that is a terrible blow, not only for me, but for millions and millions in this country.
Godse, a Hindu nationalist, with links to the Hindu Mahasabha and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, made no attempt to escape; several other conspirators were soon arrested as well. The accused were Nathuram Vinayak Godse, Narayan Apte, Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, Shankar Kistayya, Dattatraya Parchure, Vishnu Karkare, Madanlal Pahwa, and Gopal Godse.: 38 The trial began on 27 May 1948 and ran for eight months before Justice Atma Charan passed his final order on 10 February 1949. The prosecution called 149 witnesses, the defense none. The court found all of the defendants except one guilty as charged. Eight men were convicted for the murder conspiracy, and others were convicted for violation of the Explosive Substances Act. Savarkar was acquitted and set free. Nathuram Godse and Narayan Apte were sentenced to death by hanging and the remaining six (including Godse's brother, Gopal) were sentenced to life imprisonment.
Gandhi's death was mourned nationwide. Over a million people joined the five-mile-long funeral procession that took over five hours to reach Raj Ghat from Birla house, where he was assassinated, and another million watched the procession pass by. Gandhi's body was transported on a weapons carrier, whose chassis was dismantled overnight to allow a high-floor to be installed so that people could catch a glimpse of his body. The engine of the vehicle was not used; instead four drag-ropes held by 50 people each pulled the vehicle. All Indian-owned establishments in London remained closed in mourning as thousands of people from all faiths and denominations and Indians from all over Britain converged at India House in London.


=== Funeral and memorials ===
Gandhi was cremated in accordance with Hindu tradition. His ashes were poured into urns which were sent across India for memorial services. Most of the ashes were immersed at the Sangam at Allahabad on 12 February 1948, but some were secretly taken away. In 1997, Tushar Gandhi immersed the contents of one urn, found in a bank vault and reclaimed through the courts, at the Sangam at Allahabad. Some of Gandhi's ashes were scattered at the source of the Nile River near Jinja, Uganda, and a memorial plaque marks the event. On 30 January 2008, the contents of another urn were immersed at Girgaum Chowpatty. Another urn is at the palace of the Aga Khan in Pune (where Gandhi was held as a political prisoner from 1942 to 1944) and another in the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine in Los Angeles.The Birla House site where Gandhi was assassinated is now a memorial called Gandhi Smriti. The place near Yamuna river where he was cremated is the Rāj Ghāt memorial in New Delhi. A black marble platform, it bears the epigraph ""Hē Rāma"" (Devanagari: हे ! राम or, Hey Raam). These are said to be Gandhi's last words after he was shot.


== Principles, practices, and beliefs ==

Gandhi's statements, letters and life have attracted much political and scholarly analysis of his principles, practices and beliefs, including what influenced him. Some writers present him as a paragon of ethical living and pacifism, while others present him as a more complex, contradictory and evolving character influenced by his culture and circumstances.


=== Truth and Satyagraha ===
Gandhi dedicated his life to discovering and pursuing truth, or Satya, and called his movement satyagraha, which means ""appeal to, insistence on, or reliance on the Truth"". The first formulation of the satyagraha as a political movement and principle occurred in 1920, which he tabled as ""Resolution on Non-cooperation"" in September that year before a session of the Indian Congress. It was the satyagraha formulation and step, states Dennis Dalton, that deeply resonated with beliefs and culture of his people, embedded him into the popular consciousness, transforming him quickly into Mahatma.
Gandhi based Satyagraha on the Vedantic ideal of self-realisation, ahimsa (nonviolence), vegetarianism, and universal love. William Borman states that the key to his satyagraha is rooted in the Hindu Upanishadic texts. According to Indira Carr, Gandhi's ideas on ahimsa and satyagraha were founded on the philosophical foundations of Advaita Vedanta. I. Bruce Watson states that some of these ideas are found not only in traditions within Hinduism, but also in Jainism or Buddhism, particularly those about non-violence, vegetarianism and universal love, but Gandhi's synthesis was to politicise these ideas. Gandhi's concept of satya as a civil movement, states Glyn Richards, are best understood in the context of the Hindu terminology of Dharma and Ṛta.Gandhi stated that the most important battle to fight was overcoming his own demons, fears, and insecurities. Gandhi summarised his beliefs first when he said ""God is Truth"". He would later change this statement to ""Truth is God"". Thus, satya (truth) in Gandhi's philosophy is ""God"". Gandhi, states Richards, described the term ""God"" not as a separate power, but as the Being (Brahman, Atman) of the Advaita Vedanta tradition, a nondual universal that pervades in all things, in each person and all life. According to Nicholas Gier, this to Gandhi meant the unity of God and humans, that all beings have the same one soul and therefore equality, that atman exists and is same as everything in the universe, ahimsa (non-violence) is the very nature of this atman.
The essence of Satyagraha is ""soul force"" as a political means, refusing to use brute force against the oppressor, seeking to eliminate antagonisms between the oppressor and the oppressed, aiming to transform or ""purify"" the oppressor. It is not inaction but determined passive resistance and non-co-operation where, states Arthur Herman, ""love conquers hate"". A euphemism sometimes used for Satyagraha is that it is a ""silent force"" or a ""soul force"" (a term also used by Martin Luther King Jr. during his ""I Have a Dream"" speech). It arms the individual with moral power rather than physical power. Satyagraha is also termed a ""universal force"", as it essentially ""makes no distinction between kinsmen and strangers, young and old, man and woman, friend and foe.""Gandhi wrote: ""There must be no impatience, no barbarity, no insolence, no undue pressure. If we want to cultivate a true spirit of democracy, we cannot afford to be intolerant. Intolerance betrays want of faith in one's cause."" Civil disobedience and non-co-operation as practised under Satyagraha are based on the ""law of suffering"", a doctrine that the endurance of suffering is a means to an end. This end usually implies a moral upliftment or progress of an individual or society. Therefore, non-co-operation in Satyagraha is in fact a means to secure the co-operation of the opponent consistently with truth and justice.While Gandhi's idea of satyagraha as a political means attracted a widespread following among Indians, the support was not universal. For example, Muslim leaders such as Jinnah opposed the satyagraha idea, accused Gandhi to be reviving Hinduism through political activism, and began effort to counter Gandhi with Muslim nationalism and a demand for Muslim homeland. The untouchability leader Ambedkar, in June 1945, after his decision to convert to Buddhism and the first Law and Justice minister of modern India, dismissed Gandhi's ideas as loved by ""blind Hindu devotees"", primitive, influenced by spurious brew of Tolstoy and Ruskin, and ""there is always some simpleton to preach them"". Winston Churchill caricatured Gandhi as a ""cunning huckster"" seeking selfish gain, an ""aspiring dictator"", and an ""atavistic spokesman of a pagan Hinduism"". Churchill stated that the civil disobedience movement spectacle of Gandhi only increased ""the danger to which white people there [British India] are exposed"".


=== Nonviolence ===
Although Gandhi was not the originator of the principle of nonviolence, he was the first to apply it in the political field on a large scale. The concept of nonviolence (ahimsa) has a long history in Indian religious thought, and is considered the highest dharma (ethical value virtue), a precept to be observed towards all living beings (sarvbhuta), at all times (sarvada), in all respects (sarvatha), in action, words and thought. Gandhi explains his philosophy and ideas about ahimsa as a political means in his autobiography The Story of My Experiments with Truth.Even though Gandhi considered non-violence to be ""infinitely superior to violence"", he preferred violence to cowardice. He added that he ""would rather have India resort to arms in order to defend her honor than that she should in a cowardly manner become or remain a helpless witness to her own dishonor"".


== Literary works ==
Gandhi was a prolific writer. His signature style was simple, precise, clear and as devoid of artificialities. One of Gandhi's earliest publications, Hind Swaraj, published in Gujarati in 1909, became ""the intellectual blueprint"" for India's independence movement. The book was translated into English the next year, with a copyright legend that read ""No Rights Reserved"". For decades he edited several newspapers including Harijan in Gujarati, in Hindi and in the English language; Indian Opinion while in South Africa and, Young India, in English, and Navajivan, a Gujarati monthly, on his return to India. Later, Navajivan was also published in Hindi. In addition, he wrote letters almost every day to individuals and newspapers.Gandhi also wrote several books including his autobiography, The Story of My Experiments with Truth (Gujarātī ""સત્યના પ્રયોગો અથવા આત્મકથા""), of which he bought the entire first edition to make sure it was reprinted. His other autobiographies included: Satyagraha in South Africa about his struggle there, Hind Swaraj or Indian Home Rule, a political pamphlet, and a paraphrase in Gujarati of John Ruskin's Unto This Last which was an early critique of political economy. This last essay can be considered his programme on economics. He also wrote extensively on vegetarianism, diet and health, religion, social reforms, etc. Gandhi usually wrote in Gujarati, though he also revised the Hindi and English translations of his books. In 1934, he wrote Songs from Prison while prisoned in Yerawada jail in Maharashtra.Gandhi's complete works were published by the Indian government under the name The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi in the 1960s. The writings comprise about 50,000 pages published in about a hundred volumes. In 2000, a revised edition of the complete works sparked a controversy, as it contained a large number of errors and omissions. The Indian government later withdrew the revised edition.


== Legacy ==

Gandhi is noted as the greatest figure of the successful Indian independence movement against the British rule. He is also hailed as the greatest figure of modern India. American historian Stanley Wolpert described Gandhi as ""India's greatest revolutionary nationalist leader"" and the greatest Indian since the Buddha. In 1999, Gandhi was named ""Asian of the century"" by Asiaweek. In a 2000 BBC poll, he was voted as the greatest man of the millennium.The word Mahatma, while often mistaken for Gandhi's given name in the West, is taken from the Sanskrit words maha (meaning Great) and atma (meaning Soul). He was publicly bestowed with the honorific title ""Mahatma"" in July 1914 at farewell meeting in Town Hall, Durban. Rabindranath Tagore is said to have accorded the title to Gandhi by 1915. In his autobiography, Gandhi nevertheless explains that he never valued the title, and was often pained by it.Innumerable streets, roads and localities in India are named after Gandhi. These include M.G.Road (the main street of a number of Indian cities including Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Lucknow, Kanpur, Gangtok and Indore), Gandhi Market (near Sion, Mumbai) and Gandhinagar (the capital of the state of Gujarat, Gandhi's birthplace).As of 2008, over 150 countries released stamps on Gandhi. In October 2019, about 87 countries including Russia, Iran, Turkey, Uzbekistan, Palestine released commemorative Gandhi stamps on 150th birth anniversary of Gandhi.Florian asteroid 120461 Gandhi was named in his honour in September 2020. In October 2022, a statue of Gandhi was installed in Astana on the embankment of the rowing canal, opposite the cult monument to the defenders of Kazakhstan.On 15 December 2022, the United Nations headquarters in New York unveiled the statue of Gandhi. UN Secretary-General António Guterres called Gandhi an ""uncompromising advocate for peaceful co-existence"".


=== Followers and international influence ===
Gandhi influenced important leaders and political movements. Leaders of the civil rights movement in the United States, including Martin Luther King Jr., James Lawson, and James Bevel, drew from the writings of Gandhi in the development of their own theories about nonviolence. King said ""Christ gave us the goals and Mahatma Gandhi the tactics."" King sometimes referred to Gandhi as ""the little brown saint."" Anti-apartheid activist and former President of South Africa, Nelson Mandela, was inspired by Gandhi. Others include Steve Biko, Václav Havel, and Aung San Suu Kyi.In his early years, the former President of South Africa Nelson Mandela was a follower of the nonviolent resistance philosophy of Gandhi. Bhana and Vahed commented on these events as ""Gandhi inspired succeeding generations of South African activists seeking to end White rule. This legacy connects him to Nelson Mandela...in a sense, Mandela completed what Gandhi started.""Gandhi's life and teachings inspired many who specifically referred to Gandhi as their mentor or who dedicated their lives to spreading Gandhi's ideas. In Europe, Romain Rolland was the first to discuss Gandhi in his 1924 book Mahatma Gandhi, and Brazilian anarchist and feminist Maria Lacerda de Moura wrote about Gandhi in her work on pacifism. In 1931, physicist Albert Einstein exchanged letters with Gandhi, and called him ""a role model for the generations to come"" in a letter writing about him. Einstein said of Gandhi:

Mahatma Gandhi's life achievement stands unique in political history. He has invented a completely new and humane means for the liberation war of an oppressed country, and practised it with greatest energy and devotion. The moral influence he had on the consciously thinking human being of the entire civilised world will probably be much more lasting than it seems in our time with its overestimation of brutal violent forces. Because lasting will only be the work of such statesmen who wake up and strengthen the moral power of their people through their example and educational works. We may all be happy and grateful that destiny gifted us with such an enlightened contemporary, a role model for the generations to come.
Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this walked the earth in flesh and blood.
Farah Omar, a political activist from Somaliland visited India in 1930, where he met Gandhi and was influenced by Gandhi's non-violent philosophy which he adopted in his campaign in British Somaliland.Lanza del Vasto went to India in 1936 intending to live with Gandhi; he later returned to Europe to spread Gandhi's philosophy and founded the Community of the Ark in 1948 (modelled after Gandhi's ashrams). Madeleine Slade (known as ""Mirabehn"") was the daughter of a British admiral who spent much of her adult life in India as a devotee of Gandhi.In addition, the British musician John Lennon referred to Gandhi when discussing his views on nonviolence. In 2007, former US Vice President and environmentalist Al Gore drew upon Gandhi's idea of satyagraha in a speech on climate change. 44th President of the United States Barack Obama said in September 2009 that his biggest inspiration came from Gandhi. His reply was in response to the question ""Who was the one person, dead or live, that you would choose to dine with?"". He continued that ""He's somebody I find a lot of inspiration in. He inspired Dr. King with his message of nonviolence. He ended up doing so much and changed the world just by the power of his ethics.""Time magazine named The 14th Dalai Lama, Lech Wałęsa, Martin Luther King Jr., Cesar Chavez, Aung San Suu Kyi, Benigno Aquino Jr., Desmond Tutu, and Nelson Mandela as Children of Gandhi and his spiritual heirs to nonviolence. The Mahatma Gandhi District in Houston, Texas, United States, an ethnic Indian enclave, is officially named after Gandhi.Gandhi's ideas had a significant influence on 20th-century philosophy. It began with his engagement with Romain Rolland and Martin Buber. Jean-Luc Nancy said that the French philosopher Maurice Blanchot engaged critically with Gandhi from the point of view of ""European spirituality"". Since then philosophers including Hannah Arendt, Etienne Balibar and Slavoj Žižek found that Gandhi was a necessary reference to discuss morality in politics. Recently in the light of climate change Gandhi's views on technology are gaining importance in the fields of environmental philosophy and philosophy of technology.


=== Global days that celebrate Gandhi ===
In 2007, the United Nations General Assembly declared Gandhi's birthday 2 October as ""the International Day of Nonviolence."" First proposed by UNESCO in 1948, as the School Day of Nonviolence and Peace (DENIP in Spanish), 30 January is observed as the School Day of Nonviolence and Peace in schools of many countries In countries with a Southern Hemisphere school calendar, it is observed on 30 March.


=== Awards ===
Time magazine named Gandhi the Man of the Year in 1930. In the same magazine's 1999 list of The Most Important People of the Century, Gandhi was second only to Albert Einstein, who had called Gandhi ""the greatest man of our age"". The University of Nagpur awarded him an LL.D. in 1937. The Government of India awarded the annual Gandhi Peace Prize to distinguished social workers, world leaders and citizens. Nelson Mandela, the leader of South Africa's struggle to eradicate racial discrimination and segregation, was a prominent non-Indian recipient. In 2011, Gandhi topped the TIME's list of top 25 political icons of all time.Gandhi did not receive the Nobel Peace Prize, although he was nominated five times between 1937 and 1948, including the first-ever nomination by the American Friends Service Committee, though he made the short list only twice, in 1937 and 1947. Decades later, the Nobel Committee publicly declared its regret for the omission, and admitted to deeply divided nationalistic opinion denying the award. Gandhi was nominated in 1948 but was assassinated before nominations closed. That year, the committee chose not to award the peace prize stating that ""there was no suitable living candidate"" and later research shows that the possibility of awarding the prize posthumously to Gandhi was discussed and that the reference to no suitable living candidate was to Gandhi. Geir Lundestad, Secretary of Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2006 said, ""The greatest omission in our 106-year history is undoubtedly that Mahatma Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace prize. Gandhi could do without the Nobel Peace prize, whether Nobel committee can do without Gandhi is the question"". When the 14th Dalai Lama was awarded the Prize in 1989, the chairman of the committee said that this was ""in part a tribute to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi"". In the summer of 1995, the North American Vegetarian Society inducted him posthumously into the Vegetarian Hall of Fame.


==== Father of the Nation ====
Indians widely describe Gandhi as the Father of the Nation. Origin of this title is traced back to a radio address (on Singapore radio) on 6 July 1944 by Subhash Chandra Bose where Bose addressed Gandhi as ""The Father of the Nation"". On 28 April 1947, Sarojini Naidu during a conference also referred Gandhi as ""Father of the Nation"". He is also conferred the title ""Bapu"" (Gujarati: endearment for father, papa).


=== Film, theatre and literature ===
A five-hour nine-minute long biographical documentary film, Mahatma: Life of Gandhi, 1869–1948, made by Vithalbhai Jhaveri in 1968, quoting Gandhi's words and using black and white archival footage and photographs, captures the history of those times. Ben Kingsley portrayed him in Richard Attenborough's 1982 film Gandhi, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. It was based on the biography by Louis Fischer. The 1996 film The Making of the Mahatma documented Gandhi's time in South Africa and his transformation from an inexperienced barrister to recognised political leader.
Gandhi was a central figure in the 2006 Bollywood comedy film Lage Raho Munna Bhai. Jahnu Barua's Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara (I did not kill Gandhi), places contemporary society as a backdrop with its vanishing memory of Gandhi's values as a metaphor for the senile forgetfulness of the protagonist of his 2005 film, writes Vinay Lal.
In the tale Le Jour du Jugement Dernier, in the collection Les Mémoires de Satan et autres contes loufoques, by Pierre Cormon, God tries to judge Gandhi at the Last Judgement but realises that the character is more complex than he appears.
In 1967, Gandhi was set to be featured on the album cover of one of the best selling albums of The Beatles, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, however this idea was later cancelled due to respect for Gandhi.
The 1979 opera Satyagraha by American composer Philip Glass is loosely based on Gandhi's life. The opera's libretto, taken from the Bhagavad Gita, is sung in the original Sanskrit.
The 1995 Marathi play Gandhi Virudh Gandhi explored the relationship between Gandhi and his son Harilal. The 2007 film, Gandhi, My Father was inspired on the same theme. The 1989 Marathi play Me Nathuram Godse Boltoy and the 1997 Hindi play Gandhi Ambedkar criticised Gandhi and his principles.
Several biographers have undertaken the task of describing Gandhi's life. Among them are D. G. Tendulkar with his Mahatma. Life of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi in eight volumes, Chaman Nahal's Gandhi Quartet, and Pyarelal and Sushila Nayyar with their Mahatma Gandhi in 10 volumes. The 2010 biography, Great Soul: Mahatma Gandhi and His Struggle With India by Joseph Lelyveld contained controversial material speculating about Gandhi's sexual life. Lelyveld, however, stated that the press coverage ""grossly distort[s]"" the overall message of the book. The 2014 film Welcome Back Gandhi takes a fictionalised look at how Gandhi might react to modern day India. The 2019 play Bharat Bhagya Vidhata, inspired by Pujya Gurudevshri Rakeshbhai and produced by Sangeet Natak Akademi and Shrimad Rajchandra Mission Dharampur takes a look at how Gandhi cultivated the values of truth and non-violence.
""Mahatma Gandhi"" is used by Cole Porter in his lyrics for the song ""You're the Top"" which is included in the 1934 musical Anything Goes. In the song, Porter rhymes 'Mahatma Gandhi' with 'Napoleon Brandy.'
Gandhi is mentioned in the Kris Kristofferson song ""They Killed Him.""


=== Current impact within India ===
India, with its rapid economic modernisation and urbanisation, has rejected Gandhi's economics but accepted much of his politics and continues to revere his memory. Reporter Jim Yardley notes that, ""modern India is hardly a Gandhian nation, if it ever was one. His vision of a village-dominated economy was shunted aside during his lifetime as rural romanticism, and his call for a national ethos of personal austerity and nonviolence has proved antithetical to the goals of an aspiring economic and military power."" By contrast, Gandhi is ""given full credit for India's political identity as a tolerant, secular democracy.""Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, is a national holiday in India, Gandhi Jayanti. Gandhi's image also appears on paper currency of all denominations issued by Reserve Bank of India, except for the one rupee note. Gandhi's date of death, 30 January, is commemorated as a Martyrs' Day in India.There are three temples in India dedicated to Gandhi. One is located at Sambalpur in Odisha and the second at Nidaghatta village near Kadur in Chikmagalur district of Karnataka and the third one at Chityal in the district of Nalgonda, Telangana. The Gandhi Memorial in Kanyakumari resembles central Indian Hindu temples and the Tamukkam or Summer Palace in Madurai now houses the Mahatma Gandhi Museum.


=== Descendants ===
Gandhi's children and grandchildren live in India and other countries. Grandson Rajmohan Gandhi is a professor in Illinois and an author of Gandhi's biography titled Mohandas, while another, Tarun Gandhi, has authored several authoritative books on his grandfather. Another grandson, Kanu Ramdas Gandhi (the son of Gandhi's third son Ramdas), was found living in an old age home in Delhi despite having taught earlier in the United States.

Bummerlhaus,"The Bummerlhaus is a gothic building in Steyr, Austria. It is the best preserved late Gothic mansion in Steyr, and is one of the finest medieval secular buildings in Austria.  The oldest part of the building dates from the thirteenth century, and it is first mentioned in documents dating from 1450.
The house is a typical Steyr design, consisting of a richly decorated façade facing the square, behind which lies the house and three courtyards with arcades. It has a steep hipped roof. The façade facing the square on the first floor has a cantilevered, stone carved, wide bay window, which spans the entire elevation, adorned with blind arcades and a rich frieze with quatrefoil tracery, among which the five windows are placed asymmetrically. Above the narrow roof of the wide bay window rises a brick gable wall with blind arches of brick.
The name of the house (Bummerl meaning to this time ""plump little dog"") stems from its onetime seal from its days as an inn that contained a lion the people of Steyr jokingly said looked like a dog.

"Palazzo Zuccari, Rome","Palazzo Zuccari, also called Palazzetto Zuccheri, is a 16th-century residence, located at the crossroads of via Sistina and via Gregoriana, with a Mannerist 16th-century facades on the latter street and a late Baroque facade on the piazza Trinità dei Monti in the Campo Marzio neighborhood of Rome, Italy. Designed by Federico Zuccari, the house is known locally as the ""House of Monsters"" for the decorations on its doors and windows overlooking the via Gregoriana.


== History ==
The artist Federico Zuccari worked in Rome and Florence (where he designed frescoes for the Florence Cathedral and made a name for himself as an artist. Called back to Urbe for a series of commissions, he decided to create a sumptuous mansion that displayed his importance and skill. The project would be more grandiose than his previous work in Florence, the Palazzo Zuccari.
In 1590, Zuccari bought a plot of land near the Trinità dei Monti, and its remains of the Gardens of Lucullus. He then began to construct his artist house. In the end, the grand project would almost ruin him and required a smaller scope. At Zuccari's death in 1609, he left the house to the artists of the Accademia di San Luca. Girolamo Rainaldi then took over work on the complex and gave it the look it would maintain until 1904, when the house was renovated.
The Zuccari family reacquired the palazzo and held it until the last descendant of the dynasty, the lawyer Federico Zuccari, decided to sell it to Henrichetta Hertz in the 18th century. From 1702, the palazzo housed the widowed and exiled Queen of Poland, Marie Casimire Louise de La Grange d'Arquien. She funded the construction of a wooden arch over the via Sistina and the facade with a balcony facing the square. At her direction, Filippo Juvarra painted the Polish coat of arms on the facade. She also established a small private theater from 1704 to 1714, which presented music to the Roman nobility by the queen's court musician Domenico Scarlatti.In 1756, the palazzo became a center for the Christian teaching organization, the De La Salle Brothers, which had previously been housed at the Trinità dei Monti. This use is documented in an engraving by Bartolomeo Pinelli of children leaving the school, accompanied by two brothers of the order.During the Grand Tour, the palazzo was a visiting spot for artists and scholars like Joshua Reynolds, Johann Joachim Winckelmann, Jacques-Louis David, and painters of the Nazarene movement. It then became the property of Enrichetta Hertz, who gifted the building in turn to the German government. Since 1912, the palazzo has been home to the Bibliotheca Hertziana. In 2000, the restoration of the palazzo's structure and decoration was undertaken by the architect Enrico Da Gai at the direction of the Max Planck Society, which runs the building's library.


== Architecture ==
The Via Gregoriana facade and much of the structure were built starting in 1590 by Zuccari, who frescoed the ground floor. Marie Casimire Louise de La Grange d'Arquien made later modifications, like the Trinità dei Monti facade. The palazzo is known for the odd decorations on its cornicing and windows, which look like monstrous open mouths inspired by the Gardens of Bomarzo and Mannerist architecture. The three mascaron looking out on the via Gregoriana are a major attraction of the palazzo. Zuccari had used similar designs in his illustrations of the gate to hell in Dante's Inferno.

The palazzo was initially designed in three parts: a studio on the Piazza Trinità dei Monti, the residence facing via Sistina, and the garden with an entrance from via Gregoriana. In contrast with the simplicity of its external appearance, the interior contains illustrious art. The maximum decoration occurs in the staircase, salon, gallery, and garden. The family coat of arms are visible in the fresco of the building's Doric entablature and alternated with comets, an element that reflects the coat of arms. The interior also contains frescoes by Giulio Romano that are modeled after those of the Villa Lante al Gianicolo. Outside, the garden of the building is rectangular in shape, around 17 meters on each side.

Drummully West,"Drummully West (Irish and English derived place name, Droim Mullaigh meaning ‘The Hill-Ridge of the Summit’, West meaning the western part of the original Drummully townland before it was sub-divided.) is a townland in the civil parish of Kildallan, barony of Tullyhunco, County Cavan, Ireland.


== Geography ==
Drummully West is bounded on the north by Drumbagh and Drumcartagh townlands, on the west by Druminiskill townland, on the south by Coolnashinny and Mullaghmullan townlands and on the east by Drumbo (Tullyhunco) and Drummully East townlands. Its chief geographical features are small streams, a forestry plantation and spring wells. Drummully West is traversed by the local L5503 road, minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 113 acres.


== History ==
From medieval times up to the early 1600s, the land belonged to the McKiernan Clan. Until the 1650s the present-day townland of Drumbagh formed part of Drummully West.
The 1609 Plantation of Ulster Map depicts the townland as Dromoligh. A government grant of 1610 spells the name as Dromoligh. A 1629 Inquisition spells the name as Dromoligh, Drommaleigh and Drumwillies. The 1652 Commonwealth Survey spells it as Dromully west.
In the Plantation of Ulster King James VI and I by grant dated 23 July 1610 granted the Manor of Clonyn or Taghleagh, which included the two polls of Dromoligh (now comprising the townlands of Drummully East, Drummully West and Drumbagh), to Sir Alexander Hamilton of Innerwick, Scotland. On 29 July 1611 Arthur Chichester, 1st Baron Chichester and others reported that- Sir Alexander Hamilton, Knt, 2,000 acres in the county of Cavan; has not appeared: his son Claud took possession, and brought three servants and six artificers; is in hand with building a mill; trees felled; raised stones and hath competitent arms in readiness. Besides there are arrived upon that portion since our return to Dublin from the journey, as we are informed, twelve tenants and artificers who intend to reside there and build upon the same. An Inquisition held at Cavan on 10 June 1629 stated that the 2 polls called Dromoligh are otherwise called Drumwillies and that they contained eight sub-divisions named Choiscaple, Coulcovead, Leag, Ruddaghedrom, Dromacho, Drombeach, Tonerassin and Carriglas. It also described the boundary of the townland as- Drommaleigh bounding upon the south to Croghin, meered thorow a greate boige, and upon the north to the Feache, meered thorowe a greate boige, and upon the west bounding to Drummenuskilan, meered by a runninge brooke.The 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the owner as Sir Francis Hamilton and describes it as wasteland.
In the Hearth Money Rolls compiled on 29 September 1663 there were two Hearth Tax payers in Dromlhyest- Jeffry Hansly and John Dens.
The 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the townland name as Dromully West.The 1825 Tithe Applotment Books list nine tithepayers in the townland.The Drummully West Valuation Office books are available for April 1838.Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists fifteen landholders in the townland.

In the 1901 census of Ireland, there were eight families listed in the townland.In the 1911 census of Ireland, there were eight families listed in the townland.

Hemispherectomy,"Hemispherectomy is a neurosurgical procedure in which a cerebral hemisphere (half of the upper brain, or cerebrum) is removed or disconnected. It is used to treat a variety of refractory or drug-resistant seizure disorders (epilepsy).


== Results ==
Overall, hemispherectomy is a successful procedure. A 1996 study of 52 individuals who underwent the surgery found that 96% of patients experienced reduced or completely ceased occurrence of seizures post-surgery. Studies have found no significant long-term effects on memory, personality, or humor, and minimal changes in cognitive function overall. For example, one case followed a patient who had completed college, attended graduate school and scored above average on intelligence tests after undergoing this procedure at age 5. This patient eventually developed ""superior language and intellectual abilities"" despite the removal of the left hemisphere, which contains the classical language zones.When resecting the left hemisphere, evidence indicates that some advanced language functions (e.g., higher order grammar) cannot be entirely assumed by the right side. The extent of advanced language loss is often dependent on the patient's age at the time of surgery. One study following the cognitive development of two adolescent boys who had undergone hemispherectomy found that ""brain plasticity and development arise, in part, from the brain's adaption of behavioral needs to fit available strengths and biases...The boy adapts the task to fit his brain more than he adapts his brain to fit the task."" Neuroplasticity after hemispherectomy does not imply complete regain of previous functioning, but rather the ability to adapt to the current abilities of the brain in such a way that the individual may still function, however different the new way of functioning may be.Christina Santhouse (now Paravecchia) underwent a hemispherectomy on February 13, 1996, performed by Ben Carson when she was eight years old. Previously, she had had Rasmussen's encephalitis, which caused her to experience around 150 seizures a day. After the surgery, her family was told that she would never be able to do many normal activities, such as driving a car or holding a normal job. However, she far surpassed everyone's expectations by going on to earn a master's degree in speech pathology and by getting married and having children of her own.


== Traumatic hemispherectomy ==
There are cases where a person that received major trauma to one side of the brain, such as a gunshot wound, and has required a hemispherectomy and survived. The most notable case is that of Ahad Israfil, who lost the right side of his cerebrum in 1987 in a gun-related work accident. He eventually regained most of his faculties, though he still required a wheelchair. It was noted that reconstructive surgery was difficult due to the gunshot shattering his skull, and he lived with a large indentation on that side of his head.

Soviet minesweeper T-115,"T-115 was a minesweeper of the Soviet Navy during World War II and the Cold War. She had originally been built as USS Apex (AM-142), an Admirable-class minesweeper, for the United States Navy during World War II, but never saw active service in the U.S. Navy. Upon completion she was transferred to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease as T-115; she was never returned to the United States. The ship was eventually scrapped on 1 June 1966. Because of the Cold War, the U.S. Navy was unaware of this fate and the vessel remained on the American Naval Vessel Register until she was struck on 1 January 1983.


== Career ==
Apex was laid down on 8 June 1942 at Tampa, Florida, by the Tampa Shipbuilding Co.; launched on 7 December 1942; sponsored by Mrs. J. L. Chancey; and completed on 17 August 1943. She was transferred to the Soviet Navy that same day as T-115. She was never returned to U.S. custody.
In Soviet service she was renamed Aydar on 1 September 1955. She was eventually scrapped on 1 June 1966.
Due to the ongoing Cold War, the U.S. Navy was unaware of this fate. They had reclassified the vessel as MSF-142 on 7 February 1955, and kept her on the American Naval Vessel Register until she was struck on 1 January 1983.

What If—,"""What If—"" is a fantasy short story by American writer  Isaac Asimov, first published in the Summer 1952 issue of Fantastic and reprinted in the 1969 collection Nightfall and Other Stories. The story was inspired by the author's wife who, during a car journey they were taking from New York to Boston, asked him where he got his story ideas. Before they arrived, Isaac had thought of a plot based on the journey.


== Plot summary ==
A married couple is traveling on a train from Boston to New York City. They meet a mysterious silent man known only as Mister If, who shows them a small portable television-like device about 6 by 9 inches (15 cm × 23 cm) in size.  (Mr. If's first name is implied to be What, but whether this is true or not is left to the reader.)
On the device's screen, Mr. If shows the couple scenes from their earlier lives and what might have happened if certain minor but pivotal events had not occurred.
Eventually they learned that even if the pivotal event wouldn't occur, the result would eventually be the same.


== Background ==
The theme of major events being altered by relatively minor changes would recur in Asimov's 1955 novel The End of Eternity and his 1958 short story ""Spell My Name with an S"".


== Similar devices in subsequent fiction ==
The story's theme and idea has been used in two episodes of the animated television series Futurama: ""Anthology of Interest"" and ""Anthology of Interest II"". Professor Farnsworth demonstrates a 'What If—' machine similar to Mr. If's.
A similar idea has also occurred in ""Turn Left"", a Series Four episode of the television series Doctor Who.
Neil Gaiman wrote a short story called ""The Wedding Present"" as introduction for the collection ""Smoke and Mirrors"". In this story, a couple receives as a wedding present a stack of paper sheets relating what could have happened during their to-come life in common.
The 1998 British-American romantic comedy-drama film Sliding Doors is based on a similar idea. The film alternates between two parallel universes, based on the two paths the central character's life could take depending on whether or not she catches a train, and causing different outcomes in her life.

Burying the Ex,"Burying the Ex is a 2014 American zombie comedy film directed by Joe Dante and written by Alan Trezza, starring Anton Yelchin, Ashley Greene, Alexandra Daddario and Oliver Cooper. It screened out of competition at the 71st Venice International Film Festival, and was released on June 19, 2015, by Image Entertainment.


== Plot ==
Nice guy and horror fanatic Max (Anton Yelchin) is dating the beautiful but manipulative Evelyn (Ashley Greene). Evelyn is an extreme environmentalist working for a blog company that promotes ""going green"", while Max works a dead-end job at the local horror memorabilia shop. Max often finds himself trapped trying to do whatever he can to keep Evelyn happy, including changing his diet and selling his old car. In addition to this, Max dreams of opening up a horror memorabilia shop of his own, much to Evelyn's dismay. One day at the shop, Max unloads the latest shipments and finds a Satan Genie, an object that claims it can grant anyone's wants or desires. Believing it to just be another silly item for the shop, Max places it on the shelf in the storage room and dismisses it.
Later that night, he and Evelyn have sex in the shop and make a promise to each other that they'll be together forever. Shortly thereafter, Max has Evelyn move in with him. Max and Evelyn initially decide to celebrate this new step in their relationship by grabbing a bite to eat. Wanting Evelyn to try something he enjoys for a change, Max suggests they go to a horror-themed ice cream shop run by Olivia (Alexandra Daddario). Evelyn is immediately unkind to Olivia, believing her and Max were flirting with each other. As Max pleads his case to her, Evelyn tearfully admits that she doesn't want to lose him and that he is the only thing in her life that has made her happy since her mother's death.
All seems to be great until Max comes back home to discover that Evelyn has redecorated their apartment to what she finds aesthetically pleasing and has put away all of Max's collectibles and posters, eradicating their resale value. This leads to an argument where Max states that he and Evelyn should be making decisions together instead of her taking the reins on every little thing. Feeling that Evelyn's overbearing nature will lead him to be unhappy for the duration of their relationship, Max plans to break up with her but is too scared to do so. Max turns to his slacker half-brother Travis (Oliver Cooper) for advice. Travis suggests that Max break up with Evelyn in a public place so he can make a quick getaway and have everyone present see her for the control freak she truly is. However, the plan backfires when Evelyn accidentally gets hit by a bus on her way to the park. She dies in the middle of the road while in the arms of a tearful Max.
A couple weeks go by and Max has shut himself off emotionally, feeling responsible for Evelyn's death. Travis swings by his place and, after seeing the funk he is in, encourages him to get back out and move on. Max eventually runs into Olivia again and starts to hit it off with her. As the night progresses, Max and Olivia learn that they both share the same fascination for horror. But when Max and Olivia visit the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, Evelyn is shown to have risen up from the dead and has dug herself out of the ground. After Olivia walks Max back home, he is quickly greeted by an undead Evelyn at the door. Evelyn is overjoyed and believes hers and Max's love is being given a second chance and thinks they're still dating. Frightened, Max realizes that the Satan Genie from the shop made their wish of being ""together forever"" come true and that it has brought Evelyn back from the dead. Still wanting to pursue Olivia, Max actively attempts to hide Evelyn from her. He is also left to ponder how exactly he is going to officially dump Evelyn. Max presumes that the answer to his problems lie with the Satan Genie, only to have it shatter on the ground when he loses his footing. For his backup plan, Max then researches the occult/spell books the shop has available in the hopes of finding something that will send Evelyn back to her grave. He tries these techniques, but to no avail; as they have no effect on Evelyn whatsoever.
Travis stumbles upon Max with a drunken Evelyn, and is reluctant to help him. He soon has a change of heart and tells Max that the only true way he can get rid of Evelyn is to decapitate her with a machete. Max tries to accomplish this but backs out at the last minute. The day before Halloween, Olivia drops by the shop to visit Max. It's later interrupted by a phone call from Evelyn. Olivia, who still doesn't know that Evelyn's a zombie, thinks Max hasn't gotten over her yet, but offers him an invitation to a screening of Night of the Living Dead at the cemetery. Travis steps up to the plate and offers to kill Evelyn so Max can meet Olivia at the movie. Travis shows up at the apartment under the guise of searching for an old DVD Max never returned and intentionally prolongs his stay, annoying Evelyn. She then develops a sudden craving for brains and ends up eating Travis. Meanwhile, Max and Olivia are enjoying each other's company and end up having sex in the back of Olivia's car.
Upon Max's return, he discovers Travis's corpse in the living room. Knowing that Evelyn is now determined to kill anyone who gets in her way, Max tricks her into drawing a hot bubble bath for themselves in order to barricade the bathroom door and trap her inside. He rushes out of the apartment to get the police but leaves his cell phone behind by mistake. Evelyn wastes no time breaking free and escapes. She then kidnaps Olivia after reading the texts between her and Max. Having had no luck with the police, Max hears through one of the police scanners about someone knocking over a malt shop and realizes Olivia's in trouble. Back at the apartment, Max sees Olivia tied up and Evelyn threatens to kill her. A battle ensues between Max, Evelyn, and Olivia, ending with Travis (now revealed to be a zombie himself) fatally stabbing Evelyn through the chest with the machete. With Evelyn finally gone, Max and Olivia take her body back to the cemetery and bury her.
One year later, Max and Olivia's relationship is still going strong. Max has long since quit his job, became business partners with Olivia, having joined his horror memorabilia store and her ice cream shop as an enterprise of their own and is now truly happy. Max then surprises Olivia with an engagement ring, which she gladly accepts. And Travis, still in his zombie form, is shown sign-spinning outside the shop.

== Production ==
Burying the Ex was originally produced as a 15-minute short in 2008, written and directed by Alan Trezza. It starred Danielle Harris as Olivia and Mircea Monroe as Evelyn, with the male lead (then named Zak) played by John Francis Daley. Trezza later expanded the short into a feature film script. According to an interview with director Joe Dante in 2014:

I met Alan several years ago, got the script for the feature, which was not substantially different from the one we shot. I thought it was funny and different. Cut forward five years. Unexpectedly, after another project fell through, money appeared so we could make the movie, but we had to shoot cheaply and quickly. We shot in 20 days and it was a lot of fun, a hectic shoot, but there was a lot to do. We were clever about our locations and shooting all within the same area of town... The four leads are really fun and creative and brought a lot to the table.
Principal photography began November 17, 2013 and ended December 19, 2013. Mary Woronov played the owner of a store called Bloody Mary's. However, she was cut out of the film. Dante said the film was ""very EC Comics, but it's not a comic book movie, I think the characters are a little bit more real...  I was left alone in terms of creativity."" He added that the film was made for his fans.


== Release ==
In January 2015, Image Entertainment acquired the release rights of the film, and set the release of the film in the United States, to summer 2015 via video on demand. The film was released on June 19, 2015, with the official trailer being released on May 26.


== Reception ==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 30%, based on 40 reviews, with an average rating of 4.38/10. The critics' consensus reads: ""Burying the Ex boasts flickers of director Joe Dante's former flair, but neither the concept nor its execution live up to the standard set by his best efforts."" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 37 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating ""generally unfavorable reviews"".

Christian Schnabel,"Christian Leberecht Schnabel (13 May 1878 in Regensburg – 29 January 1936 in Munich) was a German designer and inventor.


== Biography ==
Born as a son of a German smith and a Russian seamstress Schnabel was at times because of his original and innovative, but often as not very suitably for everyday life classified inventions, a well-known figure of the Bavarian public life. This made him, who received his education in his fathers smith near Regensburg,  an ideal victim of satire, from time to time Schnabel himself was asked to appear in smaller Cabaret-Shows and even a meeting with famous author Erich Kästner was reward for his dubious fame as a chronically fruitless inventor. Kästner was impressed by Schnabel and published after his death a poem about him in the book Dr. Erich Kästners lyrische Hausapotheke (1936). Later Schnabel was mentioned as one example for ""the funny Germans"" in an anthology. 
""The easy is the most difficult"" is a famous word of Schnabel and it also became the  principle of his life: Schnabel mostly experimented on everyday objects trying to improve them. Especially his simplistic food cutleries, which reached from a mixture between fork and knife up to a fork with only one prong became virtually legendary. Earning laughs for such inventions in his lifetime, today there are in more extensive cutlery sets not seldom found parts which are not unlike the Schnabel-Inventions around the turn of the century. Nevertheless it seems to be possible, that Schnabel never wanted to invent useful objects and must be seen as a kind of early performance artist.

"American Tradition Partnership, Inc. v. Bullock","American Tradition Partnership, Inc. v. Bullock, 2011 MT 328, is a decision by the Montana Supreme Court ruling that the broad free speech protections given to corporations in Citizens United v. FEC do not apply to Montana's campaign finance laws. The United States Supreme Court reversed the Montana Supreme Court's decision in American Tradition Partnership, Inc. v. Bullock, 567, U.S. 516 (2012), in a short, per curiam opinion issued without oral argument. The court wrote only that the legal issue had already been precluded by Citizens United, and this case offered no new arguments and failed to distinguish that prior decision.


== Background ==
In a 1912 ballot initiative, the citizens of Montana passed the Montana Corrupt Practices Act in response to the major influence of corporations on state elections. During the early 20th century, a number of rich ""Copper Barons"" controlled most of the political process through quid pro quo financial transactions with politicians. In response, the state restricted the amount of money that corporations and individuals could donate to campaigns. American Tradition Partnership (ATP), formerly known as Western Tradition Partnership, had challenged the Montana Corrupt Practices Act of 1912, which prohibited independent expenditures to influence political campaigns by corporations, after the United States Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling. ATP was joined in its suit by Champion Painting and the Montana Shooting Sports Association. In October 2010 District Judge Jeffrey Sherlock ruled that the Montana law is unconstitutional. Ruling Judge Sherlock said he agreed with U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson, who overturned a similar ban in Minnesota. Magnuson wrote that Citizens United ""is unequivocal: The government may not prohibit independent and indirect corporate expenditures on political speech."" Montana Attorney General Steve Bullock, a Democrat who had been elected to that office in 2008, argued on behalf of the State of Montana that the Corrupt Practices Act should remain in place.


== Opinion of the Montana Supreme Court ==
In response to a potential U.S. Supreme Court challenge, the majority opinion included a great deal of historical evidence to document the ""corrupting influence of campaign contributions on elections.""  Citizens United focused primarily on the free speech limitations of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, whereas the Montana Supreme Court focused on the historical precedent for allowing campaign finance restrictions.  In particular, the Montana Supreme Court called the Supreme Court's declaration that corporations have the same constitutional rights as individual citizens ""utter nonsense"".
The use of abundant historical precedent allowed the majority to argue that their ruling is consistent with the original intent of the First Amendment.
Additionally, the Montana Supreme Court called Citizens United a ""crabbed view of corruption"" and argued that prior to Montana's campaign finance laws ""the state of Montana and its government were operating under a mere shell of legal authority.""  The majority criticized Citizens United as being unrealistic about the corrupting influence of unlimited secret money, and the court cited a litany of evidence to prove the direct correlation between independent expenditures and political corruption.The Montana Supreme Court believed that this ruling does not blatantly contradict Citizens United because the ruling deals with a law that has major differences from the McCain-Feingold Act (the law that Citizens United partially overturned).


=== Dissent ===
James Nelson, who was one of the two dissenters, agreed with the majority opinion and called the reasoning of Citizens United ""smoke and mirrors"", but he did not believe that the Montana Supreme Court had the authority to contradict the Supreme Court.  According to Nelson, when the highest court makes a constitutional ruling, all other courts must follow it.


== U.S. Supreme Court per curiam reversal and implication ==
American Tradition Partnership appealed the Montana Supreme Court decision after the court issued its decision. ""If Montana is allowed to flout this court's holdings in Citizens United in such a willful and transparent fashion, respect for the Constitution, the rule of law and this court will be eroded"", James Bopp, American Tradition Partnership lawyer, argued.  In February 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the decision pending further review by the high court. Justices Ginsburg and Breyer released a short statement, urging the court to revisit Citizens United and ""to consider whether, in light of the huge sums of money currently deployed to buy candidate's allegiance, Citizens United should continue to hold sway."" The justices asked the court to pay attention to the empirical evidence of corruption caused by the new unlimited spending, a problem that the majority downplayed in their opinion.The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the Montana Supreme Court without hearing oral argument in American Tradition Partnership, Inc. v. Bullock, 567 U.S. 516 (2012) by a short, per curiam opinion. The court wrote only that ""[t]here can be no serious doubt"" that the holding of Citizens United applies to the Montana state law, as per U.S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2, and that ""Montana's arguments in support of the judgment below either were already rejected in Citizens United, or fail to meaningfully distinguish that case."" Justice Breyer dissented in an opinion joined by Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan. He would have reconsidered Citizens United or its applicability to the case at hand but believed that the votes to make such an effort meaningful did not exist.The court had not summarily reversed any lower court with four strongly dissenting justices with so little analysis since 1968. With its ruling the Supreme Court upheld its Citizens United landmark decision. While the Citizens United decision initially appeared to apply equally to state contests, the Supreme Court ruled in American Tradition Partnership, Inc. v. Bullock that the Citizens United holding does so by applying it to Montana state law. Because the Citizens United decision supersedes state law, the states cannot bar corporate and union political contributions in their own elections.

Marion Lerner-Levine,"Marion Lerner-Levine (b. Marion Lerner, 1931, in Hackney, London, England) is British-born American a painter, printmaker, and teacher who creates ""emotionally expressive"" still life paintings in oil and watercolor, which ""transform the traditional form of the still life into whimsical portraits of everyday life.""


== Early life and education ==
Marion Lerner-Levine is the daughter of a Polish mother and a Romanian father, LSE economist Abba Lerner . When she was six years old, the family emigrated to the United States because her father was offered a Rockefeller Foundation grant to study economics.At the age of 16, while living with her parents and twin brother in Chicago, Lerner-Levine was granted early entrance to the University of Chicago. In 1950, she furthered her education at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where she studied with Paul Weighardt, Laura Van Pappelendam, Max Kahn, and Vera Berdich. During her final year at the Art Institute, she concurrently studied etching and lithography at the Chicago Graphic Workshop. In 1954, Lerner-Levine earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree at the Art Institute of Chicago, with honors in printmaking and painting. She later studied at University of California, Los Angeles (1967–68).Upon the completion of her education, Lerner-Levine married the artist Arthur Levine (b. 1928); they have two daughters.


== Work and professional life ==
Although Lerner-Levine painted houses and yards while living in California, she turned to still life in 1968, when she and her and her family moved to Staten Island. In 1971, Lerner-Levine began to exhibit seriously after joining the Prince Street Gallery in New York City, which gave her with the opportunity to present her work as “worthy of serious consideration.” At that time, the definitive character of her art began to emerge. Her detailed “tablescapes,” as she describes them, feature oblique views of unconventional objects that she has collected. Her oil paintings usually represent arrangements of brightly colored objects, offset by strong areas of white, that are clustered in a manner reminiscent of Giorgio Morandi. Del Gaizo (1975), for example, features ordinary household items—canned goods—arrayed in a seemingly chaotic pattern, similar to what one might find in any kitchen, which Carolee Thea described as ""amusing"" and ""outside the realm of any pop-art stigma.""For Lerner-Levine, the poetic and visual impact of an appealing arrangement of forms is most important, ""turning description into interpretation."" Her paintings and watercolors are typically meticulous in rhythm and texture. Even when painting similar groups of objects, each work has its own variation of light, color, and composition. Anselm Hollo recognized her ""confidence in objects and a calm contemplative delight in them. In their ordering, arrangement, reflection onto a painted surface, they make us look at true objects—things, opposed to commodities—anew.""In the 1980s, Lerner-Levine was given solo exhibitions at the Albright–Knox Art Gallery, Springfield Art Museum, and Butler Institute of American Art, among others. Through these exhibitions, she solidified an artistic reputation that set her apart from other artists in her genre. After leaving Prince Street Gallery in 1986, Lerner-Levine returned in 1992. Lerner-Levine has had more than 20 solo exhibitions and participated in numerous group shows in New York and throughout the United States. Her work is in the permanent collections of the Brooklyn Museum, Bates College Museum of Art, Rowan University Art Gallery, Bellevue Hospital Center, Bank of America, and many others.For years, Lerner-Levine also worked as a teacher at various institutions, including Brooklyn College, University of California at Los Angeles, Educational Alliance Art School, School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and Southwest Missouri State University.

Eddie Rayner,"Anthony Edward Charles Rayner (born 19 November 1952) is a New Zealand musician who spent ten years as a keyboardist in the band Split Enz. He has also played in the groups Orb, Space Waltz, Crowded House, the Makers, The Angels in 1986-1987 and 801.


== Biography ==
Rayner was born in Lower Hutt, New Zealand in 1952.Rayner has released two solo albums. The first, Horse, was an instrumental offering released in 1995, recorded entirely at Rayner's home studio in Melbourne, Australia. The second was entitled Play it Straight, a play on a Philip Judd Split Enz song called ""Play it Strange"" that was a particular favourite of Rayner's during the mid- to late-1970s. The song was not released at the time, but was played live when Judd rejoined the band in 1977. Play it Straight consisted of re-arranged and re-recorded versions of material gleaned from other New Zealand composers.
Rayner's keyboard talents were a notable part of the Split Enz sound. Paul McCartney caught one of their shows in 1979 and became a fan of the band, eventually inviting Rayner to play keyboards on his sixth solo album, Press to Play, which was released in 1986. Rayner has also produced material for many artists including Models, Margaret Urlich, Rikki Morris, Margot Smith, and The Exponents, as well as two Enzso recordings with Split Enz members, Dame Kiri Te Kanawa and the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra.

During the late 1990s Eddie Rayner decided to take the Split Enz songs to an orchestral setting. This sparked the idea for the Enzso project. Along with his synth, the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, some Newland Singers and some former members of Split Enz, he created orchestral versions for Split Enz songs. The project ended between late 1999 and early 2000.
Recently he has acted as musical director for television show New Zealand Idol, and participated in reunions of Split Enz and Space Waltz.  He is also a member of the 1960s cover band The Con-Rays. He has also recorded with Double Life, whose other members are guitarist Adrian Stuckey, Mark Dennison (sax, flute and clarinet), and drummer Patrick Kuhtze.
In 2022, Rayner collaborated with Tim Finn on a project called Forenzics. The resulting album, Shades and Echoes, used elements from early Split Enz songs combined with Rayner's jams with Double Life.
Rayner has performed Split Enz songs along with other ex-Split Enz members, such as a 2013 tour that included other ex-members Mike Chunn, Geoff Chunn, Emlyn Crowther, and Wally Wilkinson. Vocalists on that tour included The X Factor victor Jackie Thomas, contestant Tom Batchelor, and guest vocalists Annie Crummer, Rima Te Wiata, Rikki Morris and Jesse Sheehan.
Eddie's son Harley Rayner is a member of dub band Mt Eden.


== Instruments ==
During the career of Split Enz, Rayner used a wide, changing array of keyboards. In the band's early progressive rock incarnation keyboards he used included a Mellotron, but his mainstays during the band's most popular phase were a Yamaha CP-80 electro-acoustic piano, a Yamaha CS-80 synthesizer and a Prophet 5. When he played keyboards for Crowded House on tour during the late 1980s, he was seen to be using a Yamaha DX7 and a Yamaha Clavinova. Later, during Split Enz reunion tours, Rayner used a Yamaha Motif, Ensoniq TS12 and a Clavia Nord Wave.

Adia Millett,"Adia Millett Little is a contemporary American multi-media artist whose work can be found in various forums throughout the United States and abroad. Through multiple mediums, including dioramas, quilting, painting, stitching, woodworking, and multi-media works, Millett creates her art to discover transitions and tell stories.


== Biography ==
Millett was born in 1975 in Pasadena, California. She was raised by her mother in South Central Los Angeles. Her mother first studied art, but later studied chemistry and earned a doctoral degree in psychology.
Her father was a famous stage actor and a painter, Cleavon Little. Millett's step-father, who married her mother when Adia was seven, was an architect and very supportive of her artistic endeavors.


== Career ==
After completing an undergraduate program and receiving a Bachelors of Fine Arts from the University of California at Berkeley in 1997, Millett continued her education at the California Institute of the Arts, graduating in 2000 with a Masters of Fine Arts.</ref> In 2001, Millett was chosen to participate in the Whitney Museum's Independent Studies Program. In 2002, Millett participated in the Studio Museum in Harlem residency program, and in 2003 became the resident visiting artist at Columbia College in Chicago, Il.  Millett has taught at Columbia College in Chicago, UC Santa Cruz, and Cooper Union in NY as an artist in residence. She currently teaches at California College of the Arts.


== Major projects ==


=== Inventing Truth (2001–2002) ===
A set of embroidery based artworks, this project addresses loss, memory, and the significance of everyday objects. The seven, small, framed, cross-stitched fabrics depict every day objects including a porkpie hat, a bottle of  Popov vodka, a rifle, a rose, a package of Newport menthol cigarettes, a pair of underwear, and a twenty dollar bill. By presenting objects that are stereotypically associated with black men, Millett creates a juxtaposition within her work between the feminine ""craft"" of stitching and the masculine subject matter of the individual pieces.


=== Pre-fabricated Innocence (2004–2010) ===
Pre-Fabricated Innocence is an eight part series of miniature houses that caters to our penchant for voyeurism. Each miniature illustrates melancholy interiors that display class and religious beliefs.Pre-fabricated Innocence: Anticipation (light bulbs) from 2004, for instance, is only 11 x 14 inches, but the small prism contains a table with a single chair, a bouquet of flowers, a staircase leading to a closed door, and nine functional lightbulbs. In fact, working lights, furniture, and tiny details are featured in many of Millett's miniatures. The unique decorations within the houses are an attempt to promote a space where dialog is created for characters to develop.


=== The Fire Next Time (2016) ===
The Fire Next Time (2016) is a mixed-medium piece on wood panel that takes its title from James Baldwin's seminal 1963 book. The miniature is a tiny house surrounded by billowing smoke that stands against a golden backdrop. The small dwelling is made of faded blue vertical planks with a roof of dark wooden shingles that float into the golden sky as the abode burns. This piece presents a visualization of breaking apart.


=== Infinite Edges exhibition (2019) ===
One of Adia Millett's largest exhibitions to date is entitled ""Infinite Edges,"" and was held from 14 September—9 November 2019 at Traywick Contemporary . This solo exhibition displays Millett's many practices which includes quilt-making, painting, drawing, photography, collage and sculpture. Millet uses these multi-media pieces to highlight the African American experiences while simultaneously speaking to how all living things are connected. Millett's geometric patters draw the viewer's eye from point to point, mimicking the multi-faceted, complex, and fragmented nature of life itself.


=== Quilts ===
Millett's quilts  highlight interconnectivity, as the domestic or ""craft"" based activity connects pieces of cloth or textile to one another through stitches and string. These artistic quilts simultaneously combine multiple materials and specific cultural references, as the subject matter of each specifically relates to different cultural moments. Chosen Family, for example, is one of Millett's pieces from 2018 that combines fabric, textiles, feather, and hand quilting. The pattern of the fabric and textile contained within the piece allude to traditional African textiles, and thick rim of feathers around the circumference of the quilt create a soft border that highlights the multi-media nature of the piece.

German Fallow budgerigar mutation,"The German Fallow budgerigar mutation is one of approximately 30 mutations affecting the colour of budgerigars.  At least three types of Fallow, the German, English, and Scottish, all named after their country of origin, have been established, although none of these types is common.  They are superficially similar, but adult birds may be distinguished by examining the eye.  All have red eyes, but the German Fallow shows the usual white iris ring, the eye of the English Fallow is a solid red with a barely discernible iris and the iris of the Scottish Fallow is pink.
In an attempt to regularise the names of mutations across all psittacines, it has been proposed
by Inte Onsman that the name Bronze Fallow be adopted for this mutation.


== Appearance ==
In most respects German and English Fallows are very similar.  Both resemble Cinnamons, but differ in having a much weaker body colour, which results in a rather attractive mustard-yellow breast shading to green on the rump (blue in the blue series).
The depth of the green or blue suffusion varies in individual birds, but is always more intense towards the vent and on the rump.  The throat spots, head and neck striations, and wing markings are a medium brown on a yellowish ground.  The cheek patches are a lighter and duller shade of violet than normal.  Cocks have a greyish-purple rather than the usual blue cere.  The feet and legs are pink and the beak orange.
The most obvious distinction from Cinnamons is the red eye, which in the German Fallow is a deep ruby-red, like an Ino's but a shade darker, with the usual white iris ring when adult. The English Fallow has an eye of a clear bright red, without a white iris ring—a beautiful and attractive feature. On hatching, young English Fallows have red eyes like Inos but young German Fallow chicks have plum-coloured eyes rather like Cinnamon chicks.The Dark mutation deepens the body colour of the Fallow, but the difference between the Light Green, Dark Green and Olive Fallow is far less than that between the normal Light Green, Dark Green and Olive. The Olive Fallow is ""a beautiful rich golden orange shade, and the chest is deep yellow olive—a truly lovely colouring"", says Cyril Rogers in The Fallows.
Fallow Greys and Grey-Greens generally have darker wing markings.  Opaline by itself lightens the body colour of Fallows (see), and in combination with Cinnamon produces a bird very similar in appearance to a Lacewing (i.e. a Cinnamon Ino), with virtually no body suffusion.
When the German Fallow mutation is combined with the Cinnamon and Dilute mutations, the resulting Cinnamon Dilute German Fallow is visually very similar to an Ino.


== Historical notes ==
Birds with descriptions matching Fallows appeared independently in several countries around 1930, but strains were not established.  The first report of a brownish budgerigar with red eyes seems to be of a bird bred from an Olive x Greywing Green pairing by Mr Augustin of Biel, Switzerland, in 1929.
It died without issue.  In 1931 similar birds were reported from California,
Denmark
and Germany.  The Danish strain was shown to be the same as the German birds by C af Enehjelm, who inter-bred birds from both sources and found all the young were Fallows with red eyes.The first strain to become firmly established, and that which probably founded the present-day German Fallow, originated in Magdeburg, Germany, in 1932.
The first two mutants were bred from a Cobalt cock and an Olive hen by Herr Schumann in May 1932, and this pair went on that year to produce seven more similar mutants in two further nests, giving a total of nine.
In December 1932 two of these birds were passed to C Balser and two to the partnership of Schrapel and Kokemüller, who described the appearance: ""The birds are golden yellow with undulation markings and throat spots of a definite brown shade.  The rump is olive yellow, the feet are pale pink ... and the eyes are red, but not quite such a light red as in the case of the albino.  The beak is yellow, the cere of the cocks is not so decidedly blue as in normal cocks but pale bluish purple."" translated inThe name Fallow was first applied to the variety by Herr Kokemüller after Dr Steiner, who examined some feathers microscopically, wrote to him, ""It would be better to describe this form as the fallow Budgerigar rather than cinnamon.""  At the time it was believed that Dr Steiner used the word by analogy with fallow or undeveloped land, to mean the melanin pigment was undeveloped, but as an alternative meaning for 'fallow' (and also for its German equivalent) is 'pale yellow' or 'light brown', it seems far more likely that it was this meaning that was intended.German Fallows were imported to Britain by two partnerships, H R Scott and B S Campkin, and W P C Unwin and F G Simpson, around 1933.
In 1934 Scott and Campkin had nine German Fallows breeding and were the first to successfully rear chicks in England.  Unwin and Simpson, who imported four German Fallows and six splits, bred Fallows earlier in the same year, but the chicks died in infancy.
Fallows with a white iris ring appeared in the aviaries of Mr O'Brian of Newtown, Sydney, also during the early 1930s. Later, it was established that this was the same mutation as the German Fallow.German, English and Scottish Fallows were proved to be distinct and separate mutations by test matings made independently by T G Taylor, Mrs Amber Lloyd of Walton-on-Thames and Frank Wait.
When birds of any two of the mutations were paired together only normal black-eyed young were produced.


== Genetics ==
The German Fallow is an autosomal recessive mutation.  It has been suggested that the German Fallow and the Non-sex-linked Ino are mutations of the same gene, a+, and hence they are given symbols abz and a respectively, but evidence for this allelic series is scanty.  In the absence of firm evidence, others prefer to assign the German Fallow mutation to its own locus, fg+ in the wild-type, with the symbol fg for the mutant allele.
In its visual effect, the German Fallow mutation is recessive to its wild-type allele, so a bird possessing a single German Fallow allele (the heterozygote) is identical in appearance to the wild-type light green.  That is, the presence of a single wild-type allele is sufficient to permit the full production and normal distribution of the black melanin pigment.  Among the budgerigar fancy such a bird is said to be a Light Green split German fallow, usually written Light Green/German fallow.
In a bird which has two German Fallow alleles (the homozygote), the lack of the wild-type allele means the normal black melanin pigment cannot be produced.  Instead a brown pigment is substituted, resulting in brown markings where black would appear in the Normal. The effect of the mutation on the microscopic structure of the feathers was first examined by Dr H Steiner. He found the changes were quite different from those induced by the Cinnamon mutation.  The pigment granules are smaller and more numerous than normal in both the cortex and medulla cells of the feather barbs and are often massed together in ""large drops or flakes"".  The colour is also a more reddish brown-yellow than the pale brown grains of the Cinnamon. These changes cause a reduction in the intensity of the blue colouration, giving paler birds in the blue series and yellower birds in the green series. The pigmented zone is narrower in the breast feathers than the rump feathers, and it is this structural change that causes the variation in intensity of the body suffusion between breast and rump.

Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States,"The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), also referred to as the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated (HTSA), is the primary resource for determining tariff (customs duties) classifications for goods imported into the United States. It can also be used in place of Schedule B for classifying goods exported from the United States to foreign countries. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule classifies a good based on its name, use, and/or the material used in its construction and assigns it a ten-digit classification code number, and there are over 17,000 unique classification code numbers. Although the U.S. International Trade Commission publishes and maintains the Schedule in its various forms, U.S. Customs and Border Protection is the only agency that can provide legally binding advice or rulings on classification of imports.The Schedule is based on the international Harmonized System, the global system of nomenclature that is used to describe most world trade in goods, maintained by the World Customs Organization (WCO). Virtually all countries base their tariff schedules on the WCO's Harmonized System; for example the Combined Nomenclature system is the basis for the tariff schedule of the European Union.


== History ==
The HTS was enacted by subtitle B of title I of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, and became effective on January 1, 1989, replacing the previous Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS). The United States had not adopted the previous international nomenclatures, but signed on as a member to the World Customs Organization, which created the Customs Cooperation Council (CCC) and the U.S. Customs Service—predecessor to U.S. Customs and Border Protection of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security). Such organizations helped develop the HTS throughout the 1970s.
In 1981, President Ronald Reagan requested that the U.S. International Trade Commission prepare a draft of the U.S. tariff schedules using HTS nomenclature. This conversion was issued in June 1983, and after lengthy review from interested parties, replaced the TSUS on August 23, 1988 with the enactment of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act.


== Chapters ==
The tariff schedule has 99 chapters under 22 sections, and various appendices for chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and intermediate chemicals for dye. Raw materials or basic substances generally appear in the early chapters and in earlier headings within a chapter, whereas highly processed goods and manufactured articles appear in later chapters and headings. For example, Section I and Section II cover animals and plants, while Sections XVI, XVII, and XVIII cover ""Machinery and Mechanical Appliances"", ""Vehicles, Aircraft, and Vessels"", and ""Precision Instruments, Clocks and Watches, and Musical Instruments"".
This is not a hard-and-fast rule, however; ""toys"" appear in Chapter 95 and ""works of art"" are found in Chapter 97. Chapter 77 is ""reserved for possible future use"".

Pavo–Indus Supercluster,"The Pavo–Indus Supercluster is a neighboring supercluster located about 60–70 Mpc (196–228 Mly) away in the constellations of Pavo, Indus, and Telescopium. The supercluster contains three main clusters, Abell 3656, Abell 3698, and Abell 3742.Other groups and clusters in the supercluster include the NGC 6769 Group and Abell S805 (IC 4765 Group, Pavo II, DRCG 1842-63) and the massive Norma Cluster.In 2014, it was announced that the Pavo–Indus Supercluster is a lobe in a greater supercluster, Laniakea, that is centered on the Great Attractor. The Virgo Supercluster would also be part of this greater supercluster, thus becoming the local supercluster.


== Structure ==
The Pavo-Indus Supercluster exhibits a wall or filamentary structure that extends to a total length of 66 Mpc (215 Mly). The supercluster along with the Telescopium−Grus Cloud form parts of a wall bounding the Local Void and the Sculptor Void.


== Nearby superclusters ==


=== Centaurus Supercluster ===

In 1983, in the paper by Winkler et al it was suggested based on redshift maps of the distribution of galaxies that the Pavo–Indus Supercluster may be connected to the Centaurus Supercluster. Later in 1984, in a collaboration with astronomer Tony Fairall and in a separate paper by Fairall published in 1988 titled ""A redshift map of the Triangulum Australe–Ara region: further indication that Centaurus and Pavo are one and the same supercluster"" it was concluded based on distribution of galaxies in redshift space that the Pavo–Indus supercluster was indeed connected to the Centaurus and Hydra supercluster and that the Virgo Supercluster was an appendage of a larger structure involving these superclusters. Later studies concluded that Pavo–Indus formed part of a wall of galaxies similar in size to the CfA2 Great Wall, dubbed the Norma Wall with the Norma Cluster at its center similar to the Coma Cluster. This wall encompasses the Pavo–Indus supercluster through the Norma Cluster, passing the ZOA in the Great Attractor region, to meet up with the Centaurus–Crux Cluster at a redshift at about 5,700–6,200 km/s s and the CIZA J1324.7−5736 cluster at a redshift of 5700 km/s while also splitting off  to form the Centaurus Wall passing the galactic plane to meet up with Centaurus Cluster where the supercluster originates.


=== Perseus–Pisces Supercluster ===

Di Nel la H. et al found no evidence of a connection between Pavo–Indus and the Perseus–Pisces Supercluster. However, Tully et al. revealed the existence of a filamentary extension of the Pavo-Indus Supercluster known as the Arch that caps the Local Void in the supergalactic north and provides a connection to the Perseus–Pisces Supercluster before terminating close to the NGC 7242 Cluster.


=== Ophiuchus Supercluster ===

The Pavo–Indus supercluster lies physically close to the Ophiuchus Supercluster and may be connected in an unknown filament between the two superclusters.

Baron Nugent of Riverston,"Baron Nugent of Riverston, in County Westmeath, is a title of complex status in the Jacobite peerage of the Peerage of Ireland.
The title was created on 3 April 1689 by James II after his deposition from the English throne for Thomas Nugent, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, in order for Nugent to attend the 1689 Patriot Parliament in Dublin. The title creation was recorded in the Irish Patent Roll. Nugent was subsequently outlawed as a Jacobite by William III of England, but benefitted from the terms of the Treaty of Limerick and recovered his landed property, when he continued to be referred to as Lord Nugent of Riverston.The title was claimed by the first baron's descendants who styled themselves Barons Nugent of Riverston, but without legal recognition. In July 1839, William Thomas Nugent presented his claim to the House of Lords Privileges Committee, but they adjourned the issue, declaring it sine die. In 1851, the claim to the title was inherited by Anthony Francis Nugent, 9th Earl of Westmeath, from which point it merged with the Earldom of Westmeath.

His friend and contemporary National Artist Amado V. Hernandez who also grew up in Tondo had the highest respect for Alberto. ""Siya'y isa kong iginagalang na makata at manunulat.""
""Sa ilang nobela ni Alberto Segismundo Cruz ay makikita ang pagsasanib ng tradisyonal na tema ng protesta at ilang elemento ng modernismo. Bagama't karaniwang ipinalalagay na kasabay nina Fausto Galauran at Narcisco Asistio, higit na makatwirang ibilang si Cruz sa henerasyon ng mga manunulat na naging kilala matapos ang digmaan.
""Sa kanyang mga nobela ay ipinahayag ni Cruz ang kanyang pagkabahala sa masasamang epekto ng pagpasok ng kaunlaran o sibilisasyon sa Pilipinas. Sa ""Halimuyak"" at ""Lakandula"", inilarawan ni Cruz ang isang bayang tahimik at matulain bago ito sinalanta ng sibilisasyon o kaunlaran. Ang ganitong tema ng pagkawasak ng likas na katahimikan at kagandahan ay inilangkap ni Cruz sa kuwento ng pag-ibig.""

The locomotive is depicted as if just having exited a tunnel, with the billowing smoke typical of such an exit.The sculpture is situated adjacent to Morrisons supermarket in the Morton Park shopping area to the east of Darlington town and in the civil parish of Morton Palms. A total of 185,000 Accrington Nori bricks were used in the sculpture's construction, and it is 7 metres (23 ft) high and 29 metres (95 ft) long, covering an area of 600 square metres (6,500 sq ft). It is hollow inside and special bricks provide gaps that enable bats to fly inside and roost. The sculpture is visible from the nearby A66 road, and was officially unveiled by Lord Palumbo of Walbrook on 23 June 1997.The work cost £760,000, which was provided by the National Lottery Heritage Fund along with smaller contributions from Darlington Borough Council, Northern Arts and Morrisons.

Soziologie,"Soziologie  is a 1956–1958 book by Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy (1888–1973), German social philosopher, addressing the spatial and temporal influences on “human life, language and associations. To Rosenstock-Huessy, speech is central to sociology; sociology must recognize that speech is the concrete form of social reality.”
Although it is Rosenstock-Huessy’s most systematic work. His Soziologie, has never been translated into English. It is a work that he revised periodically throughout his adult life. The book has two volumes, Band I: Die Übermacht der Räume (Volume 1: Obsession with Spaces) and Band II: Die Vollzahl der Zeiten (Volume 2: The Full Count of Times). Peter Leithart writes on ""The Relevance of Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy"" and his methods:
It’s not only the scope that impresses, but the integration. There is a passionate religious impulse behind everything he wrote, and it’s all made immediately, existentially real. But he moves rapidly from the large movements of history down to individual and family experience.


== Overview ==
The two volumes are in three parts. In Part 1, Rosenstock-Huessy addresses the areas of existence in which people confront serious life, such as marriage or service in war. “He says that important human experiences like these are created by human powers like enthusiasm, love, or faith. He then contrasts these life-changing, deeply rooted experiences in time and space with the abstract concepts, space and time. He sees these human powers as the concrete forces which create timespans, and so create and structure history.” In Part 2, he treats history as one part of each person’s soul and thereby a major influence individuals’ actions. Recurring historical events and times constitute both people’s individual and combined experiences. In Part 3, he addresses people living together and how they create communities and social structures.

Achilles Hont-Pázmány,"Achilles from the kindred Hont-Pázmány (Hungarian: Hont-Pázmány nembeli Achilles) was a prelate in the Kingdom of Hungary in the middle of the 13th century. He was provost of the collegiate chapter of Székesfehérvár and vice-chancellor between 1243 and 1251, and bishop of Pécs from 1251 until his death in 1252.


== Life ==
Achilles (Hungarian: Ehellős) was one of the five children of Pázmány from the kindred Hont-Pázmány. Although the genus Hont-Pázmány was one of the most illustrious clans in the Kingdom of Hungary, its Újhely branch from which Achilles descended was less prosperous. The small family lands were located in the region of the rivers Berettyó and Körös.All the same, Achilles was admitted to the royal court sometime after 1225, where he was employed as royal chaplain. His early career is uncertain, because there were four namesake clergymen in the Kingdom of Hungary in the 1230s and 1240s. He can most probably be identified with one Achilles, provost of the cathedral chapter of Esztergom from around 1236. When the Mongols invaded the Kingdom of Hungary in 1241, this Achilles fled to Dalmatia similarly to King Béla IV of Hungary. Since Archbishop Matthias Rátót of Esztergom was killed by the Mongols in the Battle of Mohi, Achilles administered the archdiocese for more than two years.Following the withdrawal of the Mongols, Provost Achilles was at least twice appointed by the pope to investigate the circumstances of appointments to higher Church offices, including the election of Benedict as Archbishop of Kalocsa in 1243. Achilles himself was transferred to the collegiate chapter of Székesfehérvár in September 1243. Head of the prestigious chapter, Achilles also became the vice-chancellor, the leader of the royal administration. The royal chancery started to function more uniformly under his auspices, and the registration of the charters issued by the chancery was also begun in this period. King Béla IV of Hungary granted him a landed property in Ugocsa County which suggests that the monarch also respected Achilles's work.King Béla IV sent Achilles to the court of Daniel, Prince of Halych in 1246, in order to betroth his daughter Constance to Leo, Daniel's son, according to the Galician–Volhynian Chronicle. This occurred following Daniel repulsed the attack of the Hungarians led by Béla's son-in-law and claimant Rostislav Mikhailovich in the previous year.When Bishop Bartholomew le Gros of Pécs retired in 1251, King Béla IV recommended Achilles to his place. Respecting the monarch's wish, the canons of the cathedral chapter of Pécs elected Achilles bishop in the spring of 1251. He is first styled as bishop-elect on 23 July 1251. The pope confirmed his election by 23 November 1251. The new bishop visited the monastery his predecessor had established for hermits on the Saint James (Ürög) Hill at Pécs and personally marked out the borders of its nearby properties. He also promised to make further donations to the community, but he unexpectedly died in the first months of 1252. He left his lands in Ugocsa to his relatives.

Physical training instructor,"Physical training instructor (PTI) is a term used primarily in the British Armed Forces and British police, as well as some other Commonwealth countries, for an instructor in physical fitness.


== United Kingdom ==
In the British Army, specialist Physical Training Instructors (PTIs) of the Royal Army Physical Training Corps are attached to individual units to oversee physical training and manage military gymnasiums. They are assisted by All Arm Physical Training Instructors (AAPTIs), previously known as Assistant Physical Training Instructors (APTIs), who have other jobs within their unit as well as being qualified, but not specialist, physical training instructors. The PTI badge consists of crossed swords.Physical training instructors in the Royal Navy are officially titled Physical Trainers and are known as ""club swingers"" or ""clubs"" from the crossed clubs they wear as a rate badge. In the Royal Air Force, the PTI badge consists of crossed swords with an eagle in the centre.


== New Zealand ==
The New Zealand Defence Force also employs Physical Training Instructors who bear the same symbols as their British counterparts. The New Zealand Army Physical Training Corps wear the crossed swords, Royal New Zealand Navy PTIs wear the crossed clubs, and Royal New Zealand Air Force PTIs wear the clubs and arms.
In March 2016, all Navy, Army and Air Force Physical Training Instructors were amalgamated into the new NZDF tri-service unit known as the Joint Operational Health Group.
NZDF PTIs use the motto Mens Sana In Corpore Sano, which roughly translates as ""a healthy mind in a healthy body"".


== Argentina ==
The Argentine Army has a Physical Training Service, made up of PT teachers graduated from civilian schools, who join the Army as commissioned officers, following a short course at the Military Academy. Each combat unit is supposed to have an PT officer, who reports to the operations officer (S-3). In larger units, such as academies and schools, they are complemented by civilian teachers.
The Argentine Navy and Air Force, instead, rely on hired civilian teachers for their physical training.

"Cârța, Harghita","Cârța (Romanian: [ˈkɨrtsa]; Hungarian: Csíkkarcfalva or Karcfalva [ˈ(t͡ʃiːk)kɒrt͡sfɒlvɒ]) is a commune in Romania, located in Harghita County. It lies in the Székely Land, an ethno-cultural region in eastern Transylvania.
The commune is composed of two villages: Cârța (Karcfalva) and Ineu (Csíkjenőfalva). Tomești has been an independent commune since 2004.


== History ==
The village belonged to the Székely seat of Csíkszék, then from 1876 until 1918 to the Csík County in the Kingdom of Hungary. In the aftermath of World War I and the Hungarian–Romanian War of 1918–1919, it passed under Romanian administration; after the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, like the rest of Transylvania, it became part of the Kingdom of Romania. During the interwar period, the village fell within Ciuc County. In 1940, the Second Vienna Award granted Northern Transylvania to Hungary and the village was held by Hungary until 1944. After Soviet occupation, the Romanian administration returned and the village became officially part of Romania in March 1945. Between 1952 and 1960, the commune fell within the Magyar Autonomous Region, between 1960 and 1968 the Mureș-Magyar Autonomous Region. In 1968, the region was abolished, and since then, the commune has been part of Harghita County.


== Demographics ==
At the 2011 census, the commune had a population of 2,709; out of them, 98% were Hungarian and 0.3% were Romanian. 97% of the commune population are Roman Catholic, 1% are Reformed and 0.4% are Orthodox.


== Landmarks ==
Its Roman Catholic church dedicated to honour of Virgin Mary was built around 1448 by rebuilding an older church from donation of John Hunyadi. It was altered in 1720, 1796, and in 1922. Its fortified walls were built in the late 18th, early 19th centuries. The design of the defense corridors is unique in the Székely Land. The church tower was heightened in 1720 and covered with tin sheets in 1850. A great number of pagan ritual objects were found here in 1796 when the church was being altered.
Madicsa, a village notable of its mineral water source, lies 4.4 km (2.7 mi) west of the village.  There is a mineral water bath in the village.

"Monkland, Herefordshire","Monkland is a small village in the parish of Monkland and Stretford, in Herefordshire, England, about three miles (5 km) west of Leominster.


== Origin of the name ==
In Domesday the site is identifiable as Lena and also Leine. Early versions of the name develop into Monklene or ""low-lying land of the monks"" in the Hundred of Hezetre, now Hazeltree. About 1180 the variants Munkelen, Moneclene and Monkeslane are found. Some sources have the erroneous Monkllan which is Anglo-Welsh for ""Monk's Church.""


== Geography ==
The River Arrow runs to the east of the village.


== History ==
Raoul/Ralph de Tosni was born in 1037, and died in 1102 as Seneschal de Conches in Normandy;  the family also held Tosny, 30 miles from Conches.  Ralph was to have been standard-bearer to William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings but gave the honour to his younger brother Robert.  Different genealogical sources do differ, especially as there were three close relatives named Robert. After the conquest, Ralph gained some 65 manors across England in Norfolk, Worcs, Herefordshire etc.   The tax for the mill at Monkland was 11 shillings and 25 ‘sticks’of eels, each ‘stick’ being 25 eels.  The village was valued at £7.  Before the conquest, Aelmer and Ulfketel held it as two manors; ‘they could go where they would’ – an extra and not frequent piece of Domesday detail.
Monkland, the mill and its 22 residents was transferred by him to the Abbey of St Pierre and St Paul de Castillon at Conches. The town of Conches had its name changed from Castillon by his father Raoul ‘The Spaniard’ after his pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela and his wife's miraculous cure on the journey.
Ralph's wife, Isabel, the daughter of Simon I de Montfort, rode as a knight in north France and lived to the age of 90.  Tracing back to 924, Ralph's descendants remained well in royal favour until only a sister survived in 1309.  Brother Robert, the standard-bearer,  held 131 manors from King William – scattered somewhat as was William's method – and was based at Stafford where he built the castle in 1066 as Castellan. His son became Baron then much later Earl of Stafford.  The Earldom is extinct.
The Benedictine cell at Monkland was linked with the equally small cell at Wotton Waven cell in Warwickshire. These passed, to and fro by result of war, to the Crown and to Conches more than once.  In 1415, Henry V gave it to Sir Rowland Lenthall who had distinguished himself at Agincourt. After 50 years, it was resumed by the Crown and then the Manor and Priory were granted with tithes to the Dean of the Canons of St George's Chapel, Windsor. They are still vow-patrons of the benefice and relations continue, mostly via the Diocese. In 1831 the Manor was sold to a Mr Preece of Leominster; this solicitor passed it to the Bengough family of Gloucestershire in 1835, who still live in the village. Manor Farm remains, the manor itself does not.
The two parish books ‘from 1730 to 1817’ and ‘1817 to Now’ are a wonderful record of the churchwardens, poorhouse, petty constables and waywardens.  
In 1890, the parish was listed as of 1079 acres – about 1.7 sq. miles with a population of 211 in 48 houses.  The numbers are as yet little changed although there is some growth.  In the most recent state as the Civil Parish of Monkland and Stretford, its major boundary is the River Arrow to north and east.
The village lies off the A44 and is the start of the Black and White Village Trail. It has two notable buildings - one in Monkland and one in Stretford.  All Saints' Church, Monkland is Grade II* listed while St Cosmas and St Damian's Church, Stretford is Grade I listed.
Monkland is a former civil parish. In 1961 the parish had a population of 169. On 1 April 1987 the parish was abolished and merged with Stretford to form ""Monkland & Stretford"".


== All Saints church ==
The church dates from circa 1100, therefore being of Norman origin. It was built by the monks from the Abbey of Conches in Normandy.  Pevsner writes that the church is of 13th century construction and was thoroughly restored and rebuilt in 1866 by G. E. Street.  Street later worked on the Law Courts as well as York, Salisbury and Carlisle cathedrals. The 1866 work was in part a rebuild rather than the all-too-common demolish-and-newbuild.A small cell of Benedictine monks was founded at the church by Ralph de Tosni, Seneschal de Conches in Normandy where there was the Abbey of St Pierre and St Paul de Castillon. The monastic buildings were probably on the south side of the churchyard.  This was the site of the old Manor House of which deteriorating outbuildings remain. The large-scale 1880/90 Ordnance Survey maps have some useful extra detail.
Windows from the 12th, 13th and 14th century were moved and reset by Street. The stone is local and with dressings of tufa around the door and most of the windows.  The Nave and font have been dated to about 1100;  the tower, south porch and door, also the large nave windows have been dated to about 1270.
The tower is 13th-century of three stages with a corbelled cornice and a shingled timber broach spire. The second stage has lancets with labels, the first stage a square-headed window in each wall.  The fame of the church derives from it being where Sir Henry Williams Baker was from 1852 to 1877.  Ut was here that he worked as Chairman of the Committee of Compilers for Hymns Ancient and Modern.

The restoration of the Nave by Street involved demolishing the walls and re-building with the same stones in their former position – so that in effect it is as it was when built in the 13thC.  The first incumbent, Ralph de la Forde is listed from 1289 and his successors on the south wall of the Nave.  The Chancel was the gift of Sir Henry and replaced an older 1830 structure.  Sir Henry also paid for the shingled spire to be added to the tower
The East window glass is the gift in 1865 of the proprietors of Hymns Ancient and Modern – Baker's colleagues on the committee – and depicts Our Lord in Glory with angels above and a very happy group of earthly singers in a garden singing from a book; on the two side windows, angels, then saints singing and herdsmen below playing a horn and a recorder.  The glass is by John Hardman Powell of Birmingham.As well as the Organ, much of the church is adorned with gifts from Sir Henry or memorials to him.  The reredos is a crucifix sculptured in alabaster under a canopy of Purbeck marble; the figures are  the Virgin Mary and ‘the other Mary’ on the north side with St John and St Mary Magdalene on the south while the background is Salviati's mosaic. As with much else, Rev Baker aimed towards the Tractarian high-church style.

The fine Pulpit is the gift of Sir Henry's sister, Jessy.  The figures are the four great Latin Doctors: Saints ambrose, Jerome , Augustine of Hippo and Gregory the Great.
By the time of Sir Henry Williams Baker's death in 1877 sales of Hymns Ancient and Modern had reached some 8 million and the government had even issued copies to every ship in the Royal Navy.  His obituary included ""...the beautifully restored church, the excellent choir, the crowded services and the efficient school bear witness to his zeal and devotion.="" and ""... His true memorial will be found in the work' Hymns Ancient and Modern.""

Collision Course (EP),"Collision Course is a collaborative EP from American rapper Jay-Z and rock band Linkin Park, released on November 30, 2004, by Roc-A-Fella, Machine Shop, Warner Bros. and Def Jam. From Linkin Park's catalog, Collision Course features three songs from Meteora and four from Hybrid Theory. From Jay-Z's catalog, it features three songs from The Black Album, one from Vol. 3: Life and Times of S. Carter, one from Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life and one from The Blueprint. Before the album, Jay-Z had released collaborations with The Roots and R. Kelly, and Linkin Park had collaborated with various artists on their remix album Reanimation.
The album was inspired by The Grey Album by Danger Mouse, which was a mash-up album between Jay-Z and The Beatles. MTV had originally planned on mashing up only one or two songs, but the project was eventually expanded to a six-song album. The production on the album was mostly handled by Mike Shinoda and Jay-Z, and it was recorded between July 16 and July 19. The album spawned one single, ""Numb/Encore"" which won Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 48th Grammy Awards. The album received generally mixed reviews from music critics but despite that was a commercial success. It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 368,000 copies in its first week.


== Overview ==
Due to its short running time at 21:18, with six tracks in total included on the disc, the release has been identified as an EP. All of the tracks included are mashups combining songs by both artists.
The DVD contains behind-the-scenes new footage of the making of the album, as well as the second take of all of the Collision Course songs at The Roxy Theatre on July 18, 2004. Also included are the five scenes from the concert shown on MTV Ultimate Mash-Ups and a picture gallery.
The first single released from the EP, ""Numb/Encore"", achieved significant airplay on the charts, and stayed on 6 months after its release. ""Points of Authority/99 Problems/One Step Closer"" was also released to the radio in the US, but was never featured on the Billboard Charts – the videos for both that track and ""Jigga What/Faint"" were also seen on Kerrang! in the UK. ""Izzo/In the End"" was also heavily promoted on the official Linkin Park websites.


== Background and production ==
Mike Shinoda revealed in his 2004 Grammy acceptance speech that he would be mashing up with Jay-Z for a record under MTV's Mash Ups show.
The network allowed Jay-Z to choose a group or artist for the mash-up. Jay contacted Shinoda, who began experimenting with mixing the tracks before sending some examples to him. As a result, Jay-Z began working with Shinoda through email. The two decided that instead of combining the existing tracks for the live performance on MTV, they wanted to re-work and re-record parts of the songs to make them fit better. Shinoda explains, ""Jay and I realized it's better to re-perform the rap vocals if you're gonna do it to a new beat because the vibe changes and you have to deliver your verse a little differently."" Shinoda asked his bandmates to re-record instrumental and vocal tracks as well, and ultimately both parties decided they wanted to release the studio tracks. The entire album was put together within four days.Sometimes, behind-the-scenes audio can be heard within the album, such as Jay-Z saying ""You're wasting your talent, Randy!"" before ""Big Pimpin'/Papercut"", or Shinoda saying ""This is fun"" before ""Izzo/In the End"".
Collision Course was the first album of Linkin Park that contained a Parental Advisory sticker, since most of Jay-Z's verses contain profanity (although Shinoda and Chester Bennington are also heard using vulgar language on the album). This album was also made in an edited/censored version. However, the clean version of the album left the words ""bitch"", ""ass"", and ""hoes"" uncensored, which means that ""Izzo/In the End"" is the same on the clean and explicit versions.
A year after the release of Collision Course, Jay-Z was the executive producer on Mike Shinoda's solo effort Fort Minor's The Rising Tied. Also, the song ""High Road"" from the same record talks about how some critics negatively received Collision Course.


== Critical reception ==
Collision Course received generally mixed reviews from music critics. David Jeffries of AllMusic praised the album, calling it ""awesomely fun"". K.B. Tindal of HipHopDX also equally praised the album, saying that the project ""will open a passageway for artists who want to dare to be different as well as those who want to work hard to maintain that difference."" Steve Juon of RapReviews called the album ""an experiment which bodes well since for the most part these two artists compliment [sic] each other.""Meanwhile, Raymond Fiore of Entertainment Weekly, gave a negative review of the album, saying that the pairing of Linkin Park and Jay-Z ""comes off like a sanitized nonevent."" At the 48th Grammy Awards, the song ""Numb/Encore"", a mash-up of ""Numb"" by Linkin Park and ""Encore"" by Jay-Z, won the Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration.


== Commercial performance ==
Collision Course debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 368,000 copies in its first week, according to Nielsen Soundscan. This became Jay-Z eighth US number one album and Linkin Park's second.  It also became the first EP ever to top the chart since Alice in Chains' Jar of Flies in 1994. In its second week, the EP dropped to number nine on the chart, selling an additional 186,000 copies. In its third week, the EP dropped to number ten on the chart, selling 236,000 more copies. In its fourth week, the EP climbed to number eight on the chart, selling 283,000 more copies. As of August 2009, the EP has sold 1,934,000 copies in the US. On August 15, 2017, the EP was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for combined sales and album-equivalent units of over two million units in the United States.

The JCQ,"The JCQ (previously known as The James Cleaver Quintet) were a British rock band from Eastbourne, United Kingdom. They were signed to Hassle Records. Described as a ""mental breakdown set to music"", the band released one EP and two full-length studio albums: Ten Stages of a Makeup in 2010, That Was Then, This Is Now and 2011 and Mechanical Young in 2013.


== History ==
In March 2010 the band's debut extended play Ten Stages of a Make Up was released
In August 2011 the band released the EP for free on the internet in preparation for their first album's release.In January 2011 the band released the song ""Chicken Shit (For The Soul)"" as the first single off their debut album, That Was Then, This Is Now, which was proposed to be released in April. The band also completed a tour of the United Kingdom in February to support the release of the single. In August 2011 the band filmed a Lucozade advertisement, where the five members roll down with different vehicles performing a cover of Feeders' Buck Rogers.On 31 October 2011, the band released their debut album That Was Then, This Is Now, which opened to reception from popular critics such as the BBC, Drowned in Sound, and Rock Sound. In promotion of the record the band supported Turbowolf with Hawk Eyes across the United Kingdom in November. Across the next year The JCQ supported Enter Shikari and Limp Bizkit and completed a co-headline tour with The Safety Fire.On 17 June 2013, the band released their second studio album Mechanical Young. The album was recorded in Sweden with Pelle Henricsson and Eskil Lovstrom, live using vintage equipment, the band wished to record it live as they believed it captured the band's energy and argued that ""there are mistakes left in and not everything sounds 100% perfect, but that's where the real sense of the band lies – in those mistakes"". The album revived positive reception from British Publications like Big Cheese, Front Magazine, Rock Sound and This Is Fake DIY. Rock Sound writer Pete Withers in an eight out of ten review stated the album ""is an absolute triumph in every regard"". Terry Bezer when writing for Front in an otherwise positive review criticised the album saying: ""sure, they could do with a little tightening and reigning it all in a bit from time to time but there’s an unbelievable amount of potential"". For the promotion the band made a music video for Loves No Good.


== Musical style ==
The JCQ have been typically described as a ""viciously imaginative hardcore band"". Despite labelling their genre as ""no thank you"" The JCQ have been cited as post-hardcore, punk rock, art punk, garage punk, and mathcore and have been described as a ""bizarre yet daring genre-splicing of hardcore, alternative and math-rock"". The JCQ's typical style features thrash riffs, breakdowns, fast pace drumming, big choruses, rapid tempo changes, atmospheric breaks and ""spastic"" guitar work. However the band incorporates elements from other styles, including swing. Birmingham based math rock band Blakfish are seen as ""spiritual forefathers"" to the band.Their debut album That Was Then, This Is Now has been considered 'strikingly angular' 'frenetic chaos'.Mechanical Young, is seen as exploring the same areas as their first album, however is much more expansive and refined by using tenor saxophones, syncopated rhythms, keyboards, harsh riffs and an extended outro. The opening song 'Ghost Diffuse' has a doom metal-inspired guitar riff. Single 'Love's No Good' has been considered their most commercial song using a ""funky and cool Red Hot Chili Peppers cum Fun Lovin' Criminals-esque"" sing-along chorus. The three songs 'No Kind of Man Parts 1+2' and the piano based instrumental 'iii' which splits them up are considered the centrepiece of 'Mechanical Young'. Part 1 is similar to the frenetic hardcore punk of their first album, while Part 2 has a surf punk style.

San Luis Acatlán,"San Luis Acatlán is a town in San Luis Acatlán Municipality located in the state of Guerrero, Mexico. It is located in the Costa Chica region of the state, about 158 km from Acapulco. Most often called simply ""Acatlán"", the name comes from the locality of Acatlán located in the modern state of Puebla.  The name itself derives from Náhuatl, meaning ""among the reeds"". Indigenous shepherds from Puebla arrived to this place between two rivers in Guerrero around 1750.  San Luis derives from the name it was given in 1522 when soldiers of Pedro de Alvarado arrived here on this saint's day (August 25).


== The town ==
The town's population as of 2005 was 7,938.


=== History ===
The areas has been occupied by Mixtecs and Tlapanecos since the seventh century.  Around 1457, the territory was conquered by the Aztec Empire, under the rule of Moctezuma Ilhuicamina.  A number of stories exist about the town's beginnings but the most widely accepted has that the area was settled by the Tlapanecos, a group descended from a race called the Yopes. This group was in constant struggle with the Mexicas and other groups that caused them to move around in search of safer ground.  In their wanderings, these people also founded towns such as Cintla, Tepetlapa, Ayutla de Álvarez, Suchitonala and Azoyú.In 1522, after the Spanish conquest, soldiers associated with Pedro de Alvarado arrived, asking him for authorization to found a Spanish town here after discovering gold in a nearby river. Alvarado came here under orders of Hernán Cortés to establish the town, naming it Villa de San Luis. In 1531, nearby Yopes attacked  it.  The Spanish response was to attack the Yopes, killing most, and taking many of their young as slaves.  The few that remained dispersed to Oaxaca and Central America down to Nicaragua.After the river's gold ran out, the town became deserted. In 1532, the area was annexed to a town named Jalapa or Ayacaxtla. It was not until 1591, when the town became officially independent again due to efforts of the Jesuits to repopulate it. Around 1750, Olmeca shepherds migrating from Puebla settled here, naming it after the place they came from  and building their homes among Spanish ruins. In 1750, the first shepherds arrive to this place from Acatlán, Puebla. That's why, they imposed the aggregate Acatlán at the end of the town name. Later Zapotecs from Oaxaca and another group called the Xalpatlahuac from the low mountainous region of Guerrero joined them. The town was nearly wiped out again in 1825 when a large flood left few survivors.


=== Atlzazilistle (Festival to petition for rain) ===
In late April and early May, the Nahuas in this community participate in this event of pre-Hispanic origins to bring about the rainy season and to assure good crops.  Community members who have migrated as far as Mexico City and Ciudad Nezahualcóyotl return each year for this event. The festival begins on April 25 with the blessing of the seeds and climaxes in the beginning of May with a number of events. During this time these people offer birds, flowers, food, copal and wax figures at the various hills and other places considered sacred. However, the highlight of this event are the staged fights among various masked figures.The rain petition begins on the last days of the festival when men in masks, wearing jute sacks and carrying whips, called ""tlacololeros"" move in procession to the community leader's house. Here they offer the leader (called a ""mayordomo"") mezcal and pozole to invite him to the ceremonies.  After this, the entire community goes to church as the church bells ring. In the early morning of May 2, dances dating back to pre-Hispanic times are performed. On May 3, there is a procession to Mount Cruzco. Last but not least, in the center of the town, men with leather masks, huge gloves and orange, yellow or green overalls painted to make them look like tigers (or sometimes jaguars) gather in groups of up to 22 to stage fights. The belief is that the harder the tigers fight, the more abundant the rains will be when they come. Each tiger is anonymous and fighters take care to dress away from everyone else to maintain that anonymity. Younger boys, are dressed similarly by their fathers, with cardboard masks and have the tasks of keeping the crowds back and sometimes helping one tiger against another. The adult tigers, called ""tecuani"" have leather masks decorated by local artisans, some of which are worth as much as US$200.

CXOU J164710.2−455216,"CXOU J164710.2−455216 is an anomalous X-ray pulsar and magnetar in the massive galactic open cluster Westerlund 1. It is the brightest X-ray source in the cluster, and was discovered in 2005 in observations made by the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The Westerlund 1 cluster is believed to have formed in a single burst of star formation, implying that the progenitor star must have had a mass in excess of 40 solar masses. The fact that a neutron star was formed instead of a black hole implies that more than 95% of the star's original mass must have been lost before or during the supernova that produced the magnetar.On 21 September 2006 the Swift satellite detected a 20ms soft gamma-ray burst in Westerlund 1. Fortuitously, XMM-Newton observations had been made four days earlier, and repeat observations 1.5 days after the burst revealed the magnetar to be the source of the burst, with the X-ray luminosity increasing by a factor of 100 during the outburst.

Absement,"In kinematics, absement (or absition) is a measure of sustained displacement of an object from its initial position, i.e. a measure of how far away and for how long. The word absement is a portmanteau of the words absence and displacement. Similarly, absition is a portmanteau of the words absence and position.Absement changes as an object remains displaced and stays constant as the object resides at the initial position. It is the first time-integral of the displacement (i.e. absement is the area under a displacement vs. time graph), so the displacement is the rate of change (first time-derivative) of the absement. The dimension of absement is length multiplied by time. Its SI unit is meter second (m·s), which corresponds to an object having been displaced by 1 meter for 1 second. This is not to be confused with a meter per second (m/s), a unit of velocity, the time-derivative of position.
For example, opening the gate of a gate valve (of rectangular cross section) by 1 mm for 10 seconds yields the same absement of 10 mm·s as opening it by 5 mm for 2 seconds. The amount of water having flowed through it is linearly proportional to the absement of the gate, so it is also the same in both cases.


== Occurrence in nature ==
Whenever the rate of change f′ of a quantity f is proportional to the displacement of an object, the quantity f is a linear function of the object's absement. For example, when the fuel flow rate is proportional to the position of the throttle lever, then the total amount of fuel consumed is proportional to the lever's absement.
The first published paper on the topic of absement introduced and motivated it as a way to study 
flow-based musical instruments, such as the hydraulophone, to model empirical observations of some hydraulophones in which obstruction of a water jet for a longer period of time resulted in a buildup in sound level, as water accumulates in a sounding mechanism (reservoir), up to a certain maximum filling point beyond which the sound level reached a maximum, or fell off (along with a slow decay when a water jet was unblocked).  Absement has also been used to model artificial muscles, as well as for real muscle interaction in a physical fitness context.  Absement has also been used to model human posture.As the displacement can be seen as a mechanical analogue of electric charge, the absement can be seen as a mechanical analogue of the time-integrated charge, a quantity useful for modelling some types of memory elements.


== Applications ==
In addition to modeling fluid flow and for Lagrangian modeling of electric circuits, absement is used in physical fitness and kinesiology to model muscle bandwidth, and as a new form of physical fitness training.  In this context, it gives rise to a new quantity called actergy, which is to energy as energy is to power.  Actergy has the same units as action (joule-seconds) but is the time-integral of total energy (time-integral of the Hamiltonian rather than time-integral of the Lagrangian).
Fluid flow in a throttle:

A vehicle's distance travelled results from its throttle's absement. The further the throttle has been opened, and the longer it's been open, the more the vehicle's travelled.


== Relation to PID controllers ==
PID controllers are controllers that work on a signal that is proportional to a physical quantity (e.g. displacement, proportional to position) and its integral(s) and derivative(s), thusly defining PID in the context of Integrals and Derivatives of a position of a control element in the Bratland sense
depending on the type of sensor inputs, PID controllers can contain gains proportional to position, velocity, acceleration or the time integral of position (absement)…
Example of PID controller (Bratland 2014):

P, Position;
I, Absement;
D, Velocity.


== Higher integrals ==
Just as displacement and its derivatives form kinematics, so do displacement and its integrals form ""integral kinematics"", giving rise to the ordered list of n-th derivatives of displacement:


== Strain absement ==
Strain absement is the time-integral of strain, and is used extensively in mechanical systems and memsprings:

a quantity called absement which allows mem-spring models to display hysteretic response in great abundance.


== Anglement ==
Absement originally arose in situations involving valves and fluid flow, for which the opening of a valve was by a long ""T""-shaped handle, which actually varied in angle rather than position.  The time-integral of angle is called ""anglement"" and it is approximately equal or proportional to absement for small angles, because the sine of an angle is approximately equal to the angle for small angles.


== Phase space: Absement and momentement ==
In regards to a conjugate variable for absement, the time-integral of momentum, known as momentement, has been proposed.This is consistent with Jeltsema's 2012 treatment with charge and flux as the base units rather than current and voltage.

== Recording ==
Their Satanic Majesties' Second Request was recorded in 1995 at Bloody Angle Studios.


== Content ==
The album's title and music is influenced by The Rolling Stones' 1967 album Their Satanic Majesties Request.Their Satanic Majesties' Second Request reveals vast experimentation with Indian drones, sitars, mellotrons, farfisas, didgeridoos, tablas, congas, and glockenspiels. Following in the footsteps of Keith Richards and Brian Jones, BJM capture and explore the psychedelic rock sound of the late 1960s. The opening track, All Around You (Intro), pays tribute to the showmanship of the Stones, calling one and all to the psychedelic trip that they are about to experience.The song ""Donovan Said"" is itself a tribute to Donovan's ""The Fat Angel"", mimicking the vocal patterns of the verse at about a 3/4's of the speed.


== Critical reception ==

Princess Johanna Charlotte of Anhalt-Dessau,"Johanna Charlotte of Anhalt-Dessau (6 April 1682 – 31 March 1750) was a princess of Anhalt-Dessau from the House of Ascania by birth and Margravine of Brandenburg-Schwedt by marriage.  From 1729 until her death she was abbess of Herford Abbey.


== Life ==
Johanna Charlotte was the youngest daughter of John George II, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau (1627–1693), from his marriage to Henriette Catherine of Nassau (1637–1708), daughter of Prince Frederick Henry of Orange. The princess was able to take advantage of a careful and comprehensive education.
On 25 January 1699 she married Philip William, Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt (1669–1711), in Oranienbaum.  Although the couple had their own palace in Berlin, they lived mostly in Schwedt.  After the death of her husband, Johanna Charlotte went back to Berlin and looked after the education of her children.
In 1729, she had herself elected abbess of Herford Abbey, which stood under Prussian protection.  She was sworn in as the new abbess on 10 October 1729, but lived at first in Buchholz, Schaumburg.  It was not until 1735 that she took up permanent residence in Herford. Later in 1729, she added a secular order to her abbey and accepted 17 canonesses.  She appointed Hedwig Sophie of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp as her coadjutor.  Hedwig Sophie later became her successor.
Johanna Charlotte died of an ""apoplexy"", without being ill, in the night of 30 to 31 March 1750.  She was buried in the crypt of the Collegiate Chapel of Herford, which had just been renovated.


== Issue ==
From their marriage, Charlotte Johanna had the following children:

Frederick William (1700–1771), Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedtmarried in 1734 princess Sophie of Prussia (1719–1765)Friederike Dorothea Henriette (1700–1701)
Henriette Marie (1702–1782)married in 1716 Prince Frederick Louis of Württemberg (1698–1731)George William (1704–1704)

IEEE Edison Medal,"The IEEE Edison Medal is presented by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) ""for a career of meritorious achievement in electrical science, electrical engineering, or the electrical arts."" It is the oldest medal in this field of engineering.   The award consists of a gold medal, bronze replica, certificate, and honorarium.  The medal may only be awarded to a new leap/breakthrough in the technological area of science.


== Background ==
The Edison Medal, named after the inventor and entrepreneur Thomas Edison, was created on 11 February 1904 by a group of Edison's friends and associates. Four years later the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) entered into an agreement with the group to present the medal as its highest award. The first medal was presented in 1909 to Elihu Thomson. Other recipients of the Edison Medal include George Westinghouse, Alexander Graham Bell, Nikola Tesla, Michael I. Pupin, Robert A. Millikan (Nobel Prize 1923), and Vannevar Bush. A complete and authoritative list is published by the IEEE online.After the merger of AIEE and the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE), in 1963, to form the IEEE, it was decided that IRE's Medal of Honor would be presented as IEEE's highest award, while the Edison Medal would become IEEE's principal medal.
Twelve persons with an exceptional career in electrical engineering received both the IEEE Edison Medal and the IEEE Medal of Honor, namely Edwin Howard Armstrong, Ernst Alexanderson, Mihajlo Pupin, Arthur E. Kennelly, Vladimir K. Zworykin, John R. Pierce, Sidney Darlington, James L. Flanagan, Nick Holonyak, Robert H. Dennard, Dave Forney, and Kees Schouhamer Immink.

James Jabara,"James ""Jabby"" Jabara (10 October 1923 – 17 November 1966) was the first American and United States Air Force jet ace. Born in Oklahoma, he lived in Kansas where he enlisted as an aviation cadet at Fort Riley after graduating from high school. Jabara attended four flying schools in Texas before he received his pilot's wings and was commissioned as a second lieutenant. Jabara flew two tours of combat duty in Europe during World War II as a North American P-51 Mustang pilot, and scored 1.5 air victories against German aircraft.
Jabara flew his first jet aircraft in 1948, the USAF Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star before transitioning to the USAF North American F-86 Sabre. Jabara used this aircraft to shoot down multiple Soviet-built MiG-15 jets during the Korean War. He achieved his first confirmed air victory of the war on 3 April 1951. A month later he was credited with his fifth and sixth victories, making him the first American jet ace in history. He eventually scored 15 victories, giving him the title of ""triple ace"". Jabara was ranked as the second-highest-scoring U.S. ace of the Korean War. He received the Distinguished Service Cross, Silver Star, Distinguished Flying Cross, Air Medal, and the British Distinguished Flying Cross for his accomplishments in combat.
Jabara next held a series of commands at various Air Force bases across the United States. He flew the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and later the Convair B-58 Hustler. In 1966, while on leave from service in Vietnam, Colonel Jabara was traveling with his family in two cars to their new home when his daughter crashed the car she was driving and he was riding in, killing them both. They were buried together at Arlington National Cemetery. In recognition of his contributions to military aviation, an airport outside of Wichita, Kansas was named in his honor. Each year the United States Air Force Academy alumni association bestows the Jabara Award upon an Academy graduate whose aerospace accomplishments demonstrate superior performance.


== Early life ==
Jabara was born in Muskogee, Oklahoma, of Lebanese descent; his father, John, and mother came from Marjayoun, a town in Southern Lebanon.Jabara joined the Boy Scouts, eventually becoming an Eagle Scout. At an early age, he was set on becoming a pilot, ""I used to read articles about [Eddie] Rickenbacker and all these novels you read about air combat, and I guess from the sixth grade it was my ambition to be a fighter pilot."" He worked at his parents' grocery store and graduated from Wichita North High School in Wichita, Kansas in May 1942. Standing five feet, five inches (165 cm) tall, Jabara was short for a potential fighter pilot (and was reportedly required to wear corrective eyewear), but this did not prevent him from immediately enlisting as an aviation cadet of the United States Army Air Forces at Fort Riley, Kansas. In an attempt to improve his eyesight for flying, he ate 20 carrots a day in the mistaken belief that this would improve his vision. After attending four flying schools in Texas, he received his pilot's wings and a commission as second lieutenant at Moore Field, Texas in October 1943. Jabara with his wife, Nina, had four children: James William (b. 1949), Carol Ann (b. 1950), Cathy (b. 1952), and Jeanne (b. 1957).


== World War II ==
During World War II, the Allied forces fought German aircraft across the European Theater. The Allies used several fighter aircraft, including the North American P-51 Mustang. Jabara was assigned to two tours of combat duty as a P-51 pilot across Europe. His first tour lasted from January to October 1944 with the 363d Fighter Group of the Ninth Air Force. On his first mission he was assigned to attacking German railroad targets in Belgium. In a March 1944 mission while Jabara was escorting bombers to Germany, a German pilot shot off his canopy. Although he faced below freezing temperatures at the high altitude, he was able to shoot down a German aircraft before returning to base. During one mission, while in formation, he and another P-51 pilot collided in midair. They both safely bailed out while the aircraft were destroyed. In another incident, while Jabara engaged a German aircraft, they collided in mid-air, and when both pilots safely floated to the ground, they met and shook hands. When Jabara's first tour ended, he returned to the United States as an instructor for other pilots. He returned to Europe again for his second tour from February to December 1945 with the 355th Group of the Eighth Air Force. During his European combat (and known then as ""the Ceegar Kid"" for his penchant for smoking cigars), Jabara flew 108 combat missions. He was credited with the destruction of one and a half German aircraft in aerial combat (the half considered shared with another pilot) and four on the ground. He received a Distinguished Flying Cross with one Oak Leaf Cluster for his 1.5 victories as well as an Air Medal with 18 Oak Leaf Clusters.After World War II, Jabara considered leaving the military to attend college, but later decided to attend the Tactical Air School at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. From 1947 to 1949 he was stationed on Okinawa with the 53d Fighter Group. At Okinawa in 1948, Jabara flew his first jet aircraft, the Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star. Reflecting on the transition to jet aircraft, he said ""It was entirely different. I was at 10,000 feet before I remembered to raise my landing gear. ... It was so quiet and fast. ... I guess that was probably the happiest moment of my life."" Jabara returned to the United States and was assigned as a flight commander, now at the rank of captain, with the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing, flying the newly operational North American F-86 Sabre jet fighter at the New Castle County Airport in Delaware.


== Korean War ==
Before the start of the Korean War, the Korean Peninsula was split by an American-backed government at the south and a Soviet-backed opposing government at the north. Divided by the 38th Parallel, both the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to maintain the division until a mutual decision was made about the future of the peninsula. On 25 June 1950, North Korean troops crossed the parallel and attacked several key South Korean targets. As the United States prepared military assistance with the South Koreans, the Soviet Union also helped the North Koreans by training pilots and providing MiG-15 aircraft. Jabara arrived in Korea on 13 December 1950 with the 334th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron of the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing. The squadron was the first F-86 Sabre unit deployed to the Fifth Air Force to counter the threat by the Soviet MiG-15s. By 2 January 1951, he had flown five combat missions in F-86s and had damaged one MiG-15 Korean jet fighter in air combat. Jabara achieved his first confirmed victory on 3 April 1951 when 12 F-86 Sabres took on 12 MiG-15s in MiG Alley, a region in northwestern North Korea. He was credited with another on 10 April, a third on 12 April, and a fourth on 22 April- the fifth of his career making him an ace. Jabara voluntarily transferred to the 335th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron when the 334th was rotated back to the United States.

On 20 May, two flights of F-86 Sabres encountered multiple MiG-15s in MiG Alley, and through radio communications, two additional flights of F-86 Sabres joined the battle, including Jabara. In preparation for the oncoming battle, Jabara and the other F-86 Sabre pilots were ordered to jettison their auxiliary fuel tanks to improve their maneuverability. Jabara's right fuel tank failed to separate from his wing, and protocol required he return to base as the aircraft would be impeded by the extra weight and imbalance, and limit his potential to match off with a MiG. However, with his desire to become a jet ace, Jabara decided to continue to the air battle, where he was able to still handle his aircraft well enough to be credited with shooting down two MiG-15s with .50 caliber machine gun fire. The first was in a group of three MiGs and the other was the last in a six-plane group. Jabara was able to see the first aircraft explode from his gunfire, but he only saw his second victory go into a tailspin as he was avoiding being targeted by another MiG. His fifth and sixth victories made Jabara the first American in history to use jet aircraft to become an ace. The Americans said the 20-minute air battle had included 36 F-86 Sabres against nearly 50 MiG-15s (Russian data shows 30 MiGs), and the American pilots recorded Jabara's two victories and another pilot's ""probable"". While returning to base, Jabara's F-86 Sabre was so low on fuel, he turned off the engine and glided towards the base before turning it on prior to landing. Data-matching with Soviet records made available since the end of the Cold War has since shown that only one MiG was lost in the combat, and that Jabara's jet-versus-jet tally was four at best. According to Soviet records he did not become an ace till his second combat tour in 1953. Jabara later stated in an interview, ""That was my bag for the day, and it made me feel pretty good to know that I was the first jet ace in the history of aerial warfare [sic]."" The mission was his 63rd Korean mission of an eventual 163; he was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross, the nation's second-highest decoration.

Against his wishes, Jabara received a stateside leave for a publicity tour. The Jabara family grocery store in Wichita was thronged with people for days, and both he and his father John appeared on local and national radio and television. Wichita mounted one of its most-attended parades in the city's history. Jabara was even sent on a goodwill tour with his father through the Middle East, and gave a speech in his father's hometown of Marjayoun, Lebanon. Film newsreels included footage of his aircraft and other accolades included his own song (""That Jabara Bird"") and a ritual rewarding of his Distinguished Service Cross at a Boston baseball game. Jabara returned to the United States in May 1952 for temporary assignment to Air Force Headquarters, Washington, D.C. Two months later he was transferred to the Air Training Command at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois. Upon his request, he returned for another tour of duty overseas, arriving in Korea in January 1953.By then a major, on his second tour, Jabara was credited with shooting down nine more MiGs for a total of 15 victories. On 16 May 1953 he recorded his seventh victory, and on 26 May he shot down two additional MiGs for a total of nine for the war. On 10 June, Jabara shot down two more MiGs. Eight days later his flight group encountered four MiGs, and he encountered mechanical problems that nearly caused his aircraft to crash into an elevated hill. After resolving his aircraft's issues, he returned to the battle and was able to shoot down an already damaged MiG. On 30 June, his first of two missions for the day resulted in one MiG victory. The second mission involved escorting F-86 Sabre fighter-bombers and he shot down a MiG before he came under heavy fire by other MiGs. In an attempt to evade their attack, he quickly accelerated but his engine flamed out. He maneuvered his aircraft for the ocean for a potential water rescue if he crashed, but he was able to restart the engine and return to base. Jabara recorded his final victory on 15 July. Two days later he flew his last two missions, and although he was eager to find more MiGs in an attempt to tie or surpass Joseph C. McConnell's 16 air victories, he did not see any opposing aircraft. His 15 victories gave him the title of ""triple ace"", and his Korean War victories were all against MiG-15s. He received a Silver Star, as well as another Distinguished Flying Cross for his additional air victories. During the Korean War, Jabara was second in American air victories to McConnell, who recorded 16. The Soviet Union had four other pilots who credited as having exceeded or tied Jabara's victories: Yevgeny Pepelyaev with 21 to 23, Nikolai Sutyagin with 21 to 22, and both Alexander Smorchkov and Lev Schukin with 15.


== After Korea ==
Jabara returned to the United States in July 1953, and was assigned as commander of the 4750th Training Squadron at Yuma Air Force Base (later renamed Vincent AFB), Arizona. By January 1957 Jabara was at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida to join the 3243rd Test Group to test Lockheed F-104 Starfighters. He was first reassigned to Headquarters of the 32d Air Division at Syracuse, New York, then assumed command of the 337th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at Westover Air Force Base, Massachusetts. In 1958 - 1959, Jabara flew combat missions over Taiwan in the F-104 Starfighter.
From July 1960 to June 1961, he attended and graduated from the Air War College in Montgomery, Alabama. At Carswell Air Force Base, Texas, Jabara piloted the first supersonic bomber, the Convair B-58 Hustler as part of the 43d Bomb Wing. Jabara also helped train NATO pilots on the F-104 Starfighter in July 1964, when he was stationed at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona and he wrote of the aircraft's significant technological improvement over the F-86 Sabre.In 1965, Jabara was given command of the 31st Tactical Fighter Wing at Homestead Air Force Base, Florida. By 1966 Jabara had risen to the rank of colonel—the youngest at that rank at the time, and he volunteered to fly combat missions for the Vietnam War. He flew his first mission in July 1966, joining an F-100 Super Sabre flight group for a bombing run that damaged several buildings held by the Viet Cong in South Vietnam. He returned on leave to Homestead about a week after the mission.

While traveling to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, where his family would stay while he returned to combat in Vietnam, Jabara and his 16-year-old daughter Carol Anne died in a car accident in Delray Beach, Florida, on 17 November 1966. The Jabara family were in two cars that day, on their way to a new home in South Carolina where his wife Nina and their children—James Jr., Carol Anne, Jeanne, and Cathy—would reside during Jabara's combat tour. Carol Anne was driving a Volkswagen with her father as a passenger in the back seat. She lost control of the car going through a construction zone, when she initially veered onto a grass median. She swerved back onto the highway but during the rapid turn, she lost control and the vehicle returned to the median where it rolled several times. Jabara sustained head injuries and was pronounced dead on arrival at a Delray hospital, and Carol Anne died two days later. A memorial service was held for Jabara at Homestead Air Force Base with a missing man formation fly-by. Jabara and his daughter were buried together in a single grave at Arlington National Cemetery.His grandson, 2d Lt Nicholas Jabara, USAF, a 2001 graduate of the United States Air Force Academy, was killed during pilot training in a T-37 accident at Laughlin AFB, Texas on 31 January 2002.

An airport just northeast of Wichita, Kansas, was named the Colonel James Jabara Airport in his honor. Each year since 1968, the United States Air Force Academy alumni association bestows the Jabara Award upon the Academy graduate whose accomplishments demonstrate superior performance in fields directly involved with aerospace vehicles.

The Kansas Aviation Museum named him to the Kansas Aviation Hall of Fame in 2006.


== Awards and decorations ==

"Sun Valley, Idaho","Sun Valley is a resort city in the western United States, in Blaine County, Idaho, adjacent to the city of Ketchum in the Wood River valley. The population was 1,783 at the 2020 census. The elevation of Sun Valley (at the Lodge) is 5,920 feet (1,805 m) above sea level.
Among skiers, the term ""Sun Valley"" refers to the alpine ski area, which consists of Bald Mountain, the main ski mountain adjacent to Ketchum. Dollar Mountain, which is adjacent to Sun Valley, is suited for novice and lower intermediate skiers. Bald Mountain, or ""Baldy,"" has a summit of 9,150 feet (2,790 m) and a vertical drop of 3,400 feet (1,035 m). The treeless ""Dollar"" at 6,638 feet (2,023 m) has a moderate vertical drop of 628 feet (191 m).
The term ""Sun Valley"" is used more generally to speak of the region surrounding the city, including the neighboring city of Ketchum and the Wood River Valley area winding south to Hailey and Bellevue. The region has been a seasonal home to the rich and famous since first being brought to public attention by Ernest Hemingway in the late 1930s.Scheduled passenger airline service is available at Friedman Memorial Airport (SUN) in Hailey, approximately fifteen miles (25 km) south. Visitors are relatively close to the Sawtooth National Recreation Area, accessed over Galena Summit on State Highway 75, the Sawtooth Scenic Byway.


== History ==


=== Union Pacific Railroad (1936–64) ===
The first destination winter resort in the U.S. was developed by W. Averell Harriman, the chairman of the Union Pacific Railroad, primarily to increase ridership on U.P. passenger trains in the Western United States. The UP's City of Portland (from Chicago and Omaha) and Portland Rose (from Kansas City) went to Shoshone in southern Idaho, where buses (then called ""motor coaches"") took travelers to Sun Valley. Sleeping car passengers from Los Angeles were able to take direct carriages on the UP's Pony Express from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City, and the Sun Valley Special from Salt Lake City to Sun Valley.The success of the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York, spurred an increase in participation in winter sports (and alpine skiing in particular). A lifelong skier, Harriman determined that America would embrace a destination mountain resort, similar to those enjoyed in the Swiss Alps, such as St. Moritz and Davos.During the winter of 1935–36, Harriman enlisted the services of an Austrian Sportsman, Count Felix von Schaffgotsch, to travel across the Western U.S. to locate an ideal site for a winter resort. The Count toured Mount Rainier, Mount Hood, Yosemite, the San Bernardino Mountains, Zion, Rocky Mountain National Park, the Wasatch Range, Pocatello, Jackson Hole, and Grand Targhee areas.Late in his trip and on the verge of abandoning his search for an ideal location for a mountain resort development, he backtracked toward the Ketchum area in central Idaho. A U.P. employee in Boise had casually mentioned that the rail spur to Ketchum cost the company more money for snow removal than any other branch line and the Count went to explore.Schaffgotsch was impressed by the combination of Bald Mountain and its surrounding mountains, adequate snowfall, abundant sunshine, moderate elevation, and absence of wind, and selected it as the site. Harriman visited several weeks later and agreed. The 3,888-acre (15.73 km2) Brass Ranch was purchased for about $4 per acre and construction commenced that spring; it was built in seven months for $1.5 million. Publicist Steve Hannagan named the resort ""Sun Valley"" and developed the tag line: “Winter sports under a summer sun"". (Count Schaffgotsch returned to Austria and was killed on the Eastern Front during World War II.) The centerpiece of the new resort was the Sun Valley Lodge, which opened on December 21, 1936.The 220-room, X-shaped lodge's exterior was constructed of concrete, poured inside rough-sawn forms. The wood grain was impressed on the concrete finish, which was acid-stained brown to imitate wood. The Swiss-style Sun Valley Inn (originally the ""Challenger Inn"") and village were also part of the initial resort, opening in 1937. Hannagan wanted swimming pools at the resort, ""so people won't think skiing is too cold.""Both the Lodge and the Inn have heated outdoor swimming pools, circular in shape. Hannagan had the pools designed this way, unique at the time, in the hope they would be widely photographed, providing free publicity, and it worked.


==== Chairlifts ====
The world's first chairlifts were installed on the resort's Proctor and Dollar mountains in the fall of 1936. (Proctor Mountain is northeast of Dollar Mountain). They have since been removed, but parts of the base of the Proctor Mountain chairlift can still be seen near the Proctor Mountain trail, along with a plaque identifying the area as the location of the world's first chairlift. Additionally, the original lift operator's station (now repainted) for the chairlift on Dollar Mountain is still standing. One of the early single chairlifts was transported to Cordova, Alaska in the 1970s where it now serves Mount Eyak Ski Area as the oldest operating charlift in the world. The U.P. chairlift design was adapted by an engineer recalling banana loading conveyor equipment used for tropical fruit ships' cargo. Single-seat chairlifts were developed at the U.P. headquarters in Omaha in the summer of 1936. The chairlift went on to replace primitive rope tow and other adaptations seen at ski areas at the time. The original Proctor Mountain Ski Lift is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.


==== Celebrities ====
Author Ernest Hemingway completed For Whom the Bell Tolls, while staying in suite 206 of the Lodge in the fall of 1939. Averell Harriman had invited Hemingway and other celebrities, primarily from Hollywood, to the resort to help promote it.Gary Cooper was a frequent visitor and hunting/fishing partner, as were Clark Gable, Errol Flynn, Lucille Ball, Marilyn Monroe, and several members of the Kennedy family. Hemingway was a part-time resident over the next twenty years, eventually relocating to Ketchum (""Papa"" and his fourth wife are buried in the Ketchum Cemetery). The Hemingway Memorial, dedicated in 1966, is just off Trail Creek Road, about a mile northeast of the Sun Valley Lodge. You can still visit a number of locations that have Hemingway ties, including the Ketchum Cemetery.Sun Valley was featured (and promoted) in the 1941 movie Sun Valley Serenade, starring Sonja Henie, John Payne, Milton Berle, and bandleader Glenn Miller. Scenes were shot at the resort in March 1941. Sun Valley transfer local and future gold medalist Gretchen Fraser was the skiing stand-in for Henie.In February 1958, the cast of ""I Love Lucy"" filmed an episode of their follow-up series of hour-long specials, known in syndication as ""The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour"", at Bald Mountain.In 1971, Apollo 15 astronaut and avid skier Jim Irwin, when stepping upon the surface of the Moon's Hadley–Apennine, exclaimed that it was like Sun Valley.Adam West who played Batman on television had a ranch in the area. Other notable residents have included Scott Glenn, Richard Dreyfuss, Clint Eastwood, Sondra Locke and Janet Leigh.
Sun Valley's oldest resident was former actress and silent movie star Barbara Kent. Another resident was actress Ann Sothern.Hollywood actor, politician, and businessman, Arnold Schwarzenegger is a frequent visitor of Sun Valley and owns a residence in Ketchum, ID. He has a ski run named after him.


==== World War II ====
During World War II, the resort was closed in 1942 and converted to a convalescent hospital for the U.S. Navy (Pacific Theater), which was operational in July 1943. It re-opened to the public in December 1946.After the war, the resort's clinic operated on the third floor of the northern wing of the Sun Valley Lodge (wing closest to the Trail Creek Rd.) until the Sun Valley Community Hospital was built in 1961. That facility was named after Dr. John Moritz when he retired in 1973; the Nebraska-born surgeon had served as the resort's year-round physician for 33 years. The Moritz Hospital was closed shortly after the new St. Luke's branch hospital opened (south of Ketchum) in November 2000 and the Moritz building now serves as employee housing.


=== Bill Janss (1964–77) ===
After World War II, Harriman focused on his career in government service and the Union Pacific gradually lost interest in the resort. Rail service to Ketchum was discontinued in 1964 and that November the resort was sold to the Janss Investment Company, a major southern California real estate developer, headed by a former Olympic ski team member, Bill Janss (1918–96), founder of Snowmass. (Janss was an alternate on the 1940 team, but the games were cancelled due to the war). The railroad's management had called in the Janss Corporation as consultants and it was determined that it would take a lot of work and no less than $6 million for a face-lifting. The Union Pacific decided to sell and brothers Ed and Bill Janss bid just under $3 million.During this Janss era of ownership, the north-facing Warm Springs area was developed, as well as Seattle Ridge, and condominium and home construction increased significantly. Seven chairlifts were added, and the number of trails increased from 33 to 62. The first two double chairs on Warm Springs were installed in series in 1965; the upper ""Limelight"" had a 2,200-foot (670 m) vertical rise, the greatest in the U.S. at the time for a chairlift.Bill Janss bought out his brother's share of the resort and gained full control of Sun Valley in 1968. Snowmaking was introduced on a limited basis in the fall of 1975, covering 40 acres (16 ha) up to an elevation of 8,200 feet (2,500 m)The original Seattle Ridge double chairlift was installed in 1976, but due to a very poor snow year in 1976–77 it was not operated until December 20, 1977, christened by local legend Gretchen Fraser. Janss also has a ski run named after him, called ""Janss Pass,"" to the skier's left of the Frenchman's chairlift. Janss' wife Ann, age 54, died in early 1973 while helicopter skiing near Sun Valley.Later that year, Janss married Mrs. Glenn Cooper, a widow, family friend, and mother of five, including World Cup racer Christin Cooper, silver medalist in the women's giant slalom at the 1984 Winter Olympics.Under Janss' ownership, the Elkhorn area southeast of Dollar Mountain was developed by the Sun Valley Company and Johns-Manville, beginning in 1972.During excavation, ancient tools dating back nearly 7,000 years were discovered. Elkhorn's golf course was opened in the summer of 1975.


=== Earl Holding (1977–2013) ===
Janss was running low on funds in 1977 and had entered into negotiations to sell the resort to the Walt Disney Company. While the negotiations were strung out by Disney, Earl Holding, a Utah businessman, learned of the situation through a small article in The Wall Street Journal and contacted Janss and arranged for a meeting. For about $12 million, Holding purchased Sun Valley through his company, Sinclair Oil, which operates the Grand America Hotels & Resorts. Holding was initially distrusted by many locals: ""Earl is a Four Letter Word"" was a popular bumper sticker in the late 1970s in Blaine County. But time proved that Holding did not buy the resort for property speculation; like his other assets he meant to operate and improve for the long-term. One of his first changes was the removal the archaic single-seat chairlift on Exhibition, replacing it with a triple. A daily lift ticket for Baldy during Holding's first season (1977–78) was priced at $13.Under Holding's ownership there have been substantial improvements on the mountain: extensive snowmaking and grooming, high-capacity chairlifts, and the construction of four impressive day lodges, a gondola, and the renovation of the classic Roundhouse restaurant. The resort's golf course was redesigned in the late 1970s by Robert Trent Jones Jr.
In 1977, the Warm Springs side boasted 100 acres (0.40 km2) of snowmaking up to an elevation of 8,200 feet (2,500 m), thought to be the highest anywhere at the time. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, snowmaking was significantly expanded on Bald Mountain. Three high-speed quad chairlifts were installed during the summer of 1988 (Christmas, Challenger, & Greyhawk).An impressive day lodge, constructed of logs, river rock, and glass, opened at the base of Warm Springs in the fall of 1992, replacing the 1960s ""Northface Hut"" cafeteria. Similar day lodges were later opened at the Seattle Ridge summit (1993), and the River Run base (1995). A fire of undetermined origin damaged the Warm Springs lodge in 2018; it occurred shortly after the end of the ski season, while unoccupied at night in mid-April.
An older cafeteria, the modest one-floor ""Lookout Restaurant,"" is 120 feet (37 m) below the summit at 9,030 feet (2,750 m), at the top of three chairlifts. Built 50 years ago in 1973, it is the ground floor of a multi-story building that was never completed, resulting in its ""basement-like"" atmosphere. Nevertheless, the mountain views from this near-summit lodge are quite impressive. However, the resort's recently approved master plan has the facility slated for eventual replacement.

Four additional high-speed quads were installed in the 1990s. Two of these replaced older chairlifts on River Run (1992) and Seattle Ridge (1993), and two cut brand new paths: Lookout Express (1993) and Frenchman's (1994). The chairlift from River Run was purchased by Eldora Mountain Resort in Colorado. Baldy's 13 chairlifts have a capacity of over 23,000 skiers per hour. With an average of 3,500 skiers per day (& less than 6,000 skiers per day during peak periods), Sun Valley has kept the lift lines to a minimum, a rarity among major resorts.
The Dollar mountain Lodge opened in November 2004. This day lodge replaces the Dollar Cabin, and also serves as the headquarters for the Sun Valley Ski School. It is similar in construction to the newer day lodges at the big mountain.
The interior of the original Sun Valley Lodge has been remodeled twice during Holding's ownership, in 1985 for the golden anniversary and again in 2004. The Sun Valley Inn was also remodeled recently.The Sun Valley Golf Course saw significant improvement in the summer of 2008, with the opening of the new ""White Cloud Nine"" course on the site of the old Gun Club (relocated further down along Trail Creek road), as well as the opening of the ""Sun Valley Club"", a full service golf course club house built in the style of the resort's mountain day lodges, replacing a much smaller and older facility.
The year also saw the opening of the ""Sun Valley Pavilion,"" built in partnership with the Sun Valley Summer Symphony as a permanent home for the orchestra's annual three-and-a-half-week series of free concerts. The Pavilion is a performing arts facility that has hosted several well-known musical artists and more slated to perform in the near future.
In 2009, the resort installed the ""Roundhouse Express Gondola"" on Bald mountain, which runs from the mountain's River Run Base to the Roundhouse Restaurant (located midway up the mountain, at 7,700 feet (2,350 m). The Exhibition triple chairlift (originally a single-chair in 1939) was removed with the addition of the new enclosed 8-passenger lift. The new gondola carries skiers (and non-skiers) to the restaurant for lunch and eventually dinner year-round; the mid-mountain lodge was built 84 years ago in 1939 and remodeled in 2010 to accommodate its new year-round role.
Sun Valley opened a new 380-acre (1.5 km2) expansion in 2021, which included the new Broadway chairlift, a high-speed quad, and the removal of the nearby Cold Springs chairlift (fixed-grip double).
Earl Holding died in April 2013 and his family continues to run the resort. In 2006, Forbes magazine estimated that Sun Valley was worth in the range of $300 million.


=== Ski racing ===
In the years before the World Cup circuit, the Harriman Cup at Sun Valley was one of the major ski races held in North America, along with the ""Snow Cup"" at Alta, the ""Roch Cup"" at Aspen Mountain, and the ""Silver Belt"" races at Sugar Bowl, north of Lake Tahoe. Originally known as the ""Sun Valley International Open,"" the Harriman Cup races were the first major international ski competitions held in North America, beginning in 1937. The first three competitions of 1937–39 were held in the Boulder Mountains north of Sun Valley. Beginning in 1940, the Harriman Cup was held on the Warm Springs side of Bald Mountain, decades before chairlifts were installed on that north face of the mountain. American Dick Durrance won three of the first four Harriman Cups, stunning the overconfident Europeans.
In the final season before the launch of the World Cup, Sun Valley hosted the world's top racers in 1966 at the ""American International"" in late March, with a full slate of races for both men and women. With the 1966 World Championships not run until August, it was one of the biggest alpine racing events since the 1964 Olympics. The Austrians swept the men's downhill (Heini Messner, Karl Schranz, and Egon Zimmermann), while Jean-Claude Killy of France won the slalom, with Schranz as runner-up. The two switched places in the one-run giant slalom. Erika Schinegger of Austria, Nancy Greene of Canada, and Marielle Goitschel of France were the top three in the women's downhill, while Goitschel and teammate Annie Famose finished 1–2 in the slalom. Goitschel, Greene, and Famose were the top finishers in the giant slalom and France took the overall team title.In March 1975 and 1977, Sun Valley hosted World Cup ski races, with slalom and giant slalom events for both men and women, run on the Warm Springs side of the mountain.
The 1975 slalom was won by Gustavo Thoeni, the dominant World Cup skier of the early 1970s (which turned out to be his last win in the slalom discipline). A young Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden, perhaps the greatest technical ski racer ever, took the giant slalom title both years. Thoeni and Stenmark left Idaho tied in the overall standings in 1975, which Thoeni won in the finals of a parallel slalom the next week in Italy. Phil Mahre of White Pass, Washington, age 19, won the 1977 slalom race over Stenmark, with twin brother Steve placing third. It was Phil's second win (he had won a GS in France in December), but his first victory in the slalom and first in the U.S., and being from the Northwest, very close to home.
The present ownership has declined to host any World Cup races since, as it involves closing off runs for a significant time. But during the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake (about 300 miles (480 km) to the southeast), Sun Valley was used as a training site for many nations' alpine and Nordic ski teams. The alpine speed events for the Olympics were held at a sister resort, Snowbasin, outside of Ogden, Utah.

Sun Valley is scheduled to host the U.S. Alpine Championships in 2016 and 2018, held after the World Cup season in March. It last hosted the event in 1951.Olympic medalists from Sun Valley include Gretchen Fraser, Christin Cooper, Picabo Street, snowboarder Kaitlyn Farrington, and disabled skier Muffy Davis, a founding and honorary board member of Sun Valley Adaptive Sports. All five have runs named after them on Bald Mountain: three are on Seattle Ridge (Gretchen's Gold, Christin's Silver (ex-Silver Fox) and Muffy's Medals (ex-Southern Comfort)), Picabo's Street (ex-Plaza) on Warm Springs, and Kaitlyn's Bowl (ex-Farout Bowl) on the Bowls. US TV's legendary sports commentator Tim Ryan (CBS/NBC) also lives in Sun Valley as well as Ski Racing Magazine's proud owner, Gary Black Jr.
Still to this day, Sun Valley, Idaho holds numerous ski race events on it's world renowned terrain. Common participants such as Axel Hattrup are constantly looking forward to their next event.


== Culture ==
The non-profit Sun Valley Museum of Arts (SVMoA) was initiated in 1969 by Mrs. Glenn Cooper and Bill Janss, who later married. It attained non-profit status and was officially founded in 1971; the original 5-acre (2.0 ha) campus was located off Dollar Road in Sun Valley. Studios and workshops were open to the public and focused on ceramics, founded by James Romberg; photography, founded by Sheri Heiser and Peter deLory; and fine arts, founded by David W. Wharton. The SVC offered year-round workshops, lectures, and exhibitions by nationally recognized artists and craft persons to both residents and tourists to Blaine County. Later, the Sun Valley Center for the Arts acquired its main building in nearby Ketchum as well as a historic house and classroom in Hailey.Sun Valley is also home to the immaculate Sun Valley Film Festival. This town has a plethora of art scattered around, and is a playground for creatives to explore. Shaky Hands Caleb one of the local filmmakers makes this apparent in his breathtaking productions.
The annual Sun Valley Writers' Conference  (SVWC) was founded by journalist Reva B. Tooley], with the inaugural event run in 1995. As of 2022 Robin Eidsmo is executive director (since 2014), and novelist John Burnham Schwartz, essayist Anne Taylor Fleming, and Pulitzer Prize-winner Liaquat Ahamed help to mount the event each year.In 2018, The Argyros Performing Arts Center opened in downtown Ketchum. Since opening, the 450-seat theater has hosted nationally and internationally recognized artists such as Robert Cray, Jean-Yves Thibaudet, Isabella Boylston, Peter Cetera, Kristen Chenoweth, Rita Wilson, and others.


== Adaptive sports for the disabled ==
The Sun Valley region boasts a wide variety of year-round adaptive sports programs for the disabled including the local DSUSA Chapter – Higher Ground Sun Valley; Wood River Ability Program; Sage Brush Equine Training Center for the Handicapped and Camp Rainbow Gold, a youth cancer program.


== Two sections ==
A small mountain saddle splits the city of Sun Valley into two sections. The northern section is centered around the famous Sun Valley Lodge, Inn, and the ""village"" complex of shops, condominiums, and original 18-hole golf course (27 holes by 2008), which winds its way up the Trail Creek valley to the northeast. This area is referred to as simply ""Sun Valley.""
The southern area of Elkhorn, adjacent to Dollar Mountain, has its own condo complex and 18-hole golf course. Quite distinct and separate, including a drier ""sagebrush"" appearance, it was initially developed in 1972. The Sun Valley Company took over day-to-day operations of the Elkhorn Golf Club in July 2011 and named Rick Hickman director of golf operations for the company.Adjacent to Sun Valley is the older city of Ketchum, which is just a mile downstream of the Sun Valley Lodge (along Trail Creek). Ketchum comprises primarily the 19th-century town center (with its limited grid system) and lands adjacent to Bald Mountain along the Big Wood River and Warm Springs Creek.
The Sun Valley/Ketchum CVB offers area wide information on events, vacation planning information and area resources.
On September 11, 2005, the Dalai Lama visited Wood River High School in Hailey to give a speech on understanding and friendship in remembrance of the September 11, 2001 Attacks and offered condolences to the many thousands affected by the recent Hurricane Katrina.

== Plot ==
Shiuli Iyer and Danish ""Dan"" Walia work as interns at the same hotel. Shiuli, being very disciplined and responsible towards her job, is the polar opposite of Dan who is careless and irresponsible towards his job. At the beginning of the story, Dan struggles with his job serving various departments of the hotel. He doesn't seem to have a very good relationship with his fellow staff members except for two of his friends who work at the same hotel as interns.
On New Year's Eve, Shiuli and her friends party on the 3rd floor of the hotel, when Dan is nowhere to be found. Shiuli accidentally slips off and is hospitalized. While other members of the hotel staff visit her at the hospital, Dan gets seriously affected when his friends tell him that Shiuli's last words just before her fall were ""Where is Dan?"". Dan starts visiting the hospital every day, despite that negatively affecting both his job and his relationship with his friends who cover his shifts and help him financially. After a scuffle at the hotel, Dan is terminated. He finds comfort being with Shiuli who slowly starts to improve and Dan's mere presence calms Shiuli. He devotes his entire time to taking care of her.
Seeing Dan's career and personal life drowning due to his devotion towards Shiuli, her mother Vidya decides to make him go and take care of himself. Dan joins another hotel in Kullu as manager but is unable to take his mind off Shiuli. Soon he learns of Shiuli's failing health and visits the hospital. He apologises for leaving her abruptly and promises to stay with her. Seeing Dan, Shiuli calms and begins to improve again. She is soon discharged from the hospital and is brought home where Dan continues taking care of her. He takes her to a park and asks her why she remembered him before her fall. Shiuli responds by trying to say his name aloud. The following night Shiuli suffers a seizure and dies as her lungs collapsed. Emotionally broken, Dan visits Shiuli's home and comforts her despaired family. Afterwards, he is seen collecting her death certificate tearfully.
In a later scene, Vidya tells Dan that she was named Shiuli because of her fondness for the shiuli flower, which she loved collecting as a child with her grandfather. She further remarks how shiuli flowers are short-lived, as they live all night and die by dawn; to which Dan sorrowfully points out, her daughter too, was short-lived like her namesake flowers.
Several months later, Dan is rehired by the hotel where he completes his diploma and works as a sous chef. One day, he notices several missed calls and visits Vidya. They sit in the backyard discussing Shiuli. Pointing at the shiuli plant in the backyard, Vidya tells Dan about her family shifting to their hometown Trichy. She doesn't wish to leave Shiuli's plant, but Dan assures her that he would take care of it.
As the story ends, Shiuli's family has moved and Dan carries the shiuli plant with him, as a symbol of the unconditional and unconventional love which had blossomed in his heart for Shiuli.

== Production ==


=== Conception ===
The idea behind the film was conceived and inspired by newspaper articles and reports about whether comatose people and those with brain injuries hear when we talk to them and the spiritual exercise which brings them back.


=== Filming ===
Principal photography began in September 2017, and concluded in November 2017. The film was entirely shot in Delhi at Dwarka with a few portions shot in Connaught Place, New Delhi and Defence Colony, South Delhi. In Delhi, it was also shot in a 5-star hotel for 30 days where Varun Dhawan practiced as a hotel management student, performing his daily chores and the idea behind which was for Varun to grasp body-language and behaviour to bring more authenticity to his character in the film.


== Marketing and release ==
Varun Dhawan and Rising Sun Films first teased October in a 10-second clip released on 23 January 2018 to their official Twitter and YouTube handles, respectively. On 14 February 2018, the first-look teaser trailer of the film was released. It was followed by the release of first-look (also theatrical release) poster and official trailer on 9 March 2018 and 12 March 2018. In an interview, Shoojit Sircar said that writers do not get much credit like they do in the West. He said, ""It is important to acknowledge all the technicians in the film, especially the one who conceives it, the writers"". He feels that a writer's contribution is as important as any actor's or director's. This was the reason which made him ""deliberately"" give Juhi Chaturvedi's credit in the trailer and ""made sure the industry notices"". He further added that the Hindi film industry doesn't think writing to be important. For them, it's more ""the actor, then the director, how you shoot the film and how expensive"".
Initially, the film was scheduled to release on 1 June 2018. But in October 2017, Dhawan, in one of his tweets, revealed that the release date has been advanced. The film was released on 13 April 2018 across 2308 screens worldwide.


== Music ==

The soundtrack is composed by Shantanu Moitra, Abhishek Arora and Anupam Roy, and features playback singers such as Armaan Malik, Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, Sunidhi Chauhan and Monali Thakur. The background score of the film is composed by Moitra who also provided music for 3 tracks on the film's soundtrack album. It was released on 28 March 2018 by Zee Music Company and generally received positive reviews from the critics. The album consists of five tracks whose lyrics are penned by Abhiruchi Chand, Tanveer Ghazi and Swanand Kirkire.

== Awards and nominations ==


== Plagiarism Accusations ==
Sarika Mene, a Marathi filmmaker, had claimed that October plagiarised plot and characters from her 2017 film Aarti: The Unknown Love Story. She had filed a non-cognisable criminal complaint against makers of October at Vile Parle Police Station, Mumbai. Hemal Trivedi, also a Marathi filmmaker, who was working with Mene on the Bollywood-remake of Aarti, supported her claim via his facebook post. However, the team of Rising Sun Films had denied the allegations saying "" … We have not heard of the film 'Aarti' nor do we have full details of the matter as yet. ... We will look into this and deal with it appropriately"".In an interview that occurred before the plagiarism accusation, Shoojit Sircar said that all the films that he had directed had been very personal to him and October explores experiences of the hospital life he had lived when his mother was comatose for three months. Moreover, the film's writer Juhi Chaturvedi also took care of her mother in the hospital for years before she was finally put on ventilator and couldn't be revived. Though Aarti is an amateur project but thematic similarities between both the films can't be ignored.Despite Sircar's given statements in news interviews on the inspiration behind October, Mene said she won't give up easily and hired a new lawyer for the case because she had requested the makers of October to watch Aarti, to which they didn't respond but to no effect because ScreenWriters Association (SWA) cleared October of all the charges in a letter, dated 20 May 2018, written to Rising Sun Films and Juhi Chaturvedi from Dispute Settlement Committee set up by SWA on 5 May 2018 on the basis of facts that though ""... both the films may overlap, the treatment ... is very different ... "" and "" ... most of the details already existed ... in public domain through news articles and reports about Sunny and Aarti's story"".Even after being cleared from all the accusations, on 9 June 2018, Juhi received another legal notice from Mene claiming again that the story of October was plagiarised from Aarti. The notice demands Sunny Pawar to be credited and monetary compensation for her not being able to make a Hindi adaptation of Aarti, whose rights she had sold to Hemal Trivedi to work on it.

Tren Urbano,"The Tren Urbano (English: Urban Train) is a 10.7-mile (17.2 km) automated rapid transit system that serves the municipalities of San Juan, Guaynabo, and Bayamón, in Puerto Rico. The Tren Urbano consists of 16 stations operating on 10.7 miles (17.2 km) of track along a single line. In 2022, the system had a ridership of 2,453,100, or about 9,900 per weekday as of the second quarter of 2023.
The Tren Urbano complements other forms of public transportation services in the San Juan metropolitan area such as the Metropolitan Bus Authority, the Cataño Ferry, taxis, and shuttles. The entire mass transportation system is operated by the Integrated Transit Authority (ATI), The Tren Urbano system is operated by Alternate Concepts, Inc. (ACI). Tren Urbano is also the Caribbean's first rapid transit system.


== History ==

In the late 19th century, while the island was under Spanish rule, regional rail systems were begun in Puerto Rico. The railroad continued to be in use under American rule for most of the first half of the 20th century and played a key role in the transportation of people and goods throughout the island. The railroad systems of the period also played a vital role in the sugarcane industry.
From 1901 to 1946 San Juan had a street tramway network, known as the “Trolley” de San Juan, and was operated by the Porto Rico Railway, Light and Power Company with more than 20 miles (32 km) of tracks and ran between San Juan and Santurce. During its heyday, it was the most modern electric streetcar system in Puerto Rico, rivaled New York and Toronto, and transported nearly 10 million passengers a year.
During the 1950s, an industrial boom, partly from development programs such as Operation Bootstrap, led to the downfall of agriculture as the principal industry on the island. Automobiles became more widely available, and more efficient roads and highways and the closure of sugarcane mills displaced the need for rail transportation. Soon, it was realized that an alternative means of mass transportation was needed to complement the public bus system to alleviate the severe traffic situation that was being created, especially in the San Juan metropolitan area.


== Return of rail transit ==


=== Proposals ===
In 1967, proposals were made for the construction of a rapid rail transit system to serve the city of San Juan. In 1971, the major T.U.S.C.A. study, funded jointly by the Puerto Rico Planning Board and the US federal government, recommended an islandwide elevated transit system and new community development program. That proposal would have crossed and served the San Juan Metro Area by connecting it with the rest of the island without the necessity of highway construction. However, it was not until 1989 that the Puerto Rico Department of Transportation and Public Works (Departamento de Transportación y Obras Públicas, or DTOP in Spanish) officially adopted a proposal to begin design and construction of a rail system for the San Juan metropolitan area. The ridership demand for such a system had to be forecast by using a mathematical model prepared by a team of transportation planners and engineers. By 1992, various alignments of the proposed system were considered, but the final design chosen served only certain parts of the metro area and not Old San Juan. The name ""Tren Urbano"" (Urban Train) was chosen for the system. In 1993, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) selected it as a Turnkey Demonstration Projects under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991. In 1996 and 1997, seven design-build contracts were awarded for different segments of the Tren Urbano Phase 1 system.
A number of companies shared the tasks for building the Tren Urbano including Siemens AG, which was granted a concession to design and build the line and its rolling stock and to operate it for the first five years. The company won a contract, which was a ""first"" for North America in the scope of the work that it involved; it was awarded in July 1996.


==== Construction ====
The construction project was plagued by delays, contractual disputes between the government and companies involved in the undertaking, and investigations into possible mismanagement of funds. The project cost was US$2.28 billion.


==== Free service ====
The rail system was officially inaugurated on December 19, 2004 (2004-12-19). Free service was then offered on weekends until April 2005, when weekdays were added to the free service. Popularity grew quickly, and by the end of the free period,  40,000 people were using the train on a daily basis. By late 2005, however, ridership had fallen to 24,000, less than one third of the 80,000 projection and well below the projection of 110,000 for 2010.


==== Paid service ====
Paid fare service started on June 6, 2005 (2005-06-06). In 2006, average weekday boardings stood at 28,179 and in 2007, ridership decreased to 27,567. By the third quarter of 2008, average weekday ridership had increased to 36,500.


==== Issues and concerns ====
The Tren Urbano has no service to Old San Juan, Santurce, the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport or to many other parts of Guaynabo, Bayamón, and San Juan, and it does not serve important suburbs like Cataño, Toa Baja, Toa Alta, Carolina, Trujillo Alto, Canóvanas and others, which helps to explain low ridership. Some question the viability of the system for additional reasons, such as the lack of an island-wide public-transportation system, such as the T.U.S.C.A. system proposed in 1971. The inner-city public bus transportation system, the Metropolitan Bus Authority (AMA), which operates in the Greater San Juan Metro Area, is considered unreliable by most people, and it does not have a regular schedule. Integration with public mass transit systems, such as the AMA and the AcuaExpreso (an urban ferry), was initially poor and remains a challenge for the DTOP.


==== COVID-19 crisis ====
During the COVID-19 pandemic in Puerto Rico, services on the Tren Urbano were halted by executive order to try to stop the spread of the virus.


== Route ==

Tren Urbano is made up of a single rapid transit route. It consists of 16 stations, ten of which are elevated, four at grade or in open cuttings, and two underground. It goes mostly through suburban areas. All stations are designed to handle three permanently-coupled pairs (6 cars). The stations in the system are:

Sagrado Corazón (Sagrado Corazón)
Hato Rey (Golden Mile / José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum)
Roosevelt (Roosevelt Ave. and Ponce de León Ave.)
Domenech (Hato Rey)
Piñero (Hato Rey)
Universidad (University of Puerto Rico at Río Piedras)
Río Piedras (Río Piedras)
Cupey
Centro Médico (Puerto Rico Medical Services Administration and University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus)
San Francisco (535 parking spaces)
Las Lomas
Martínez Nadal (1,200 parking spaces)
Torrimar (Guaynabo) (45 parking spaces)
Jardines (128 parking spaces)
Deportivo (Juan Ramón Loubriel Stadium and Coliseo Rubén Rodríguez)
Bayamón (Bayamón) (400 parking spaces)Each station boasts unique a artwork and architectural style.
A maintenance depot and operations control center are halfway along the route, between Martínez Nadal and Torrimar stations.


=== Fares ===
A single trip costs $1.50 ($0.75 if customers transfer from an AMA bus), including a 1-hour bus transfer period. If a customer exits the station and wants to get back on the train, the full fare must be re-paid; there is no train-to-train transfer period. Students and seniors (aged 60–74) pay 75 cents per trip. Senior citizens older than 75 and children under 6 ride for free. Several unlimited-ride passes are also available.
A stored-value multi-use farecard may be used for travel on buses and trains. The value on the card is automatically deducted each time that it is used. The system is similar to the MetroCard system used in New York City.


=== Rolling stock ===
Tren Urbano's fleet consists of 74 Siemens, stainless steel-bodied cars, each 75 feet (23 m) long. Each vehicle carries 72 seated and 108 standing passengers. Trains have a maximum speed of 62 miles per hour (100 km/h) and average 20.6 miles per hour (33.2 km/h), including stops. All cars operate as married pairs, and up to three pairs run together at any given time. Tren Urbano operates 15 trains during rush hours, and the remaining cars stand at the yards or serve as spares if a train experiences problems. The rolling stock was assembled at the Siemens plant in Sacramento, California.Power is provided by AC traction motors, which were chosen over DC by containing fewer moving parts and requiring less maintenance. The trains share many characteristics with the stock built by Siemens for Boston MBTA's Blue Line route (700 series). The system is electrified by third rail at 750 V DC.
Air-conditioning systems have been specially designed to cope with the hot and muggy conditions that are commonly experienced in the metropolitan area.
A yellow powered flat car is visible at the maintenance facility. Some metro cars have been used to transport material when they are not in service.


=== Tren Urbano facilities ===
Rolling stock for Tren Urbano metro cars are stored at the Hogar del Niño Operations and Maintenance Building, near the exit to PR-21 from PR-20 and a short distance from Martínez Nadal station.The metro cars are stored on outdoor tracks. Also, there is a large maintenance building for servicing the fleet.
Both Bayamón and Sagrado Corazon terminal stations have dead-end tracks at the end of their respective station that can store two train sets.


=== Bus terminals ===

The bus system in the San Juan metropolitan area has been designed around the Tren Urbano. Five train stations also serve as bus terminals: Sagrado Corazón, Piñero, Cupey, Martínez Nadal, and Bayamón.


== Expansion plans ==
The infrastructure of the Tren Urbano, with stations built for six–car train sets and a minimum headway of 90 seconds, has a maximum capacity of 40,000 passengers per hour per direction, compared to 3,000 passengers per hour per direction for the current peak hour 8 minute headway and 4-car trains and to an actual daily ridership of roughly 40,000 commuters. The train system is thus working at 13.33% capacity, also well under the 110,000 rail passengers planned by 2010.

In addition, with a fleet of 74 rail vehicles in the local yard to cover at least double the 10.7 miles (17.2 km) system length and with all of the basic facilities and capital equipment needed for the functioning in place, it is indispensable for the train to be extended, as it was originally intended to include higher-density areas of the central district for it to be operationally successful and sustainable.
The Puerto Rico's Department of Transportation and Public Works (DTPW) plans include:


=== Phase 1A ===
Phase 1A of the project includes the extension of the original line westward from the current terminal at Sagrado Corazón (Sacred Heart) through a medium to high density corridor in two stations: San Mateo to a new terminal at Minillas at the heart of Santurce, a distance of 1,500 meters, with a possible transfer from Minillas to a future tram line from the historic district of Old San Juan to the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport. Phase 1A was approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
By the end of fiscal 2008, the legislature identified federal funds for the expansion of the train in its second phase. It was expected that during fiscal year 2009, the legislature would begin to issue bonds for that purpose. As of 2019, there are no plans to expand the Tren Urbano.


=== Phase 2 ===
Upon opening of the Tren Urbano, there were further proposals to extend the rail system to other municipalities such as Carolina. A two-way tunnel, 136 ft (42 meters) long, south of the Río Piedras Station is already built for a future expansion along the heavily-transited 65th Infantry Avenue.
In 2012, the government informed that it had no plans to expand the Tren Urbano in the future and that it was moving to other alternatives to help alleviate traffic.


=== Other projects ===
There are several projects to improve public transport connectivity:

Also being considered (2008) is a tramway from Sagrado Corazón station to colonial Old San Juan in Puerta de Tierra, where many of Puerto Rico's state government buildings are located. It would run partially on an existing right-of-way on Fernández Juncos Ave. The first line of the tramway would be built by the Municipality of San Juan (MSJ) and will be known as the Sistema de Asistencia, Transportación y Organización Urbana (System of Assistance, Transportation and Urban Organization) (SATOUR).
There is a proposal to build a second tram line to Carolina, possibly with a station at the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport.
The extension of a line to Caguas by the existing Urban Train from the Centro Médico or Cupey stations is considered.
A second plan for the development of a line to Caguas with a new ""Light regional railcar"" network system would have future extensions throughout the island.

Joel Rubin,"Joel Rubin is an American clarinetist, Klezmer musician, ethnomusicologist, and scholar of Jewish music. Since becoming involved in the Klezmer revival in the late 1970s, he has been researching, teaching and performing Klezmer music and related genres. He has been a member of, or performed with, such groups as Brave Old World, the Joel Rubin Ensemble,  and Veretski Pass.


== Biography ==


=== Early life and education ===
Joel Rubin was born in Los Angeles in 1955. His paternal grandfather, who was from Kyiv, was a guitarist and his maternal grandfather, who was from New York City, was a passionate fan of classical music and opera. Both men instilled a love of music in him. Rubin's father was a Psychoanalyst and his mother was a visual artist and painter. From 1973 to 1975, Rubin studied classical clarinet with Richard Stoltzman at the California Institute of the Arts. Rubin was exposed to a wider range of Eastern European music from Bill Douglas during that time. In 1975 he relocated to New York City where he studied with Kalmen Opperman, who he continued to study with for several decades. In 1978 he received a BFA from the School of Music at the State University of New York at Purchase. At around that time, he was experimenting with Jazz music and other more contemporary genres. He was often performing with Lisa Rose, a pianist who was interested in Jewish music, and when an acquaintance lent him a Dave Tarras LPs he began to take a greater interest in Klezmer music.


=== Music career ===
Rubin's career as a performer of Klezmer music began in 1980 in the Hester Street Klezmer band from Portland, Oregon, as well as a duo with Lisa Rose called The Old Country. He said in a recent interview that few people in Portland at that time had any awareness of the genre. At that time, old recordings were fairly difficult to find anywhere in the United States, so musicians would trade cassettes of 78-rpm records from the 1920s or visit archives such as YIVO in New York. KlezKamp was founded in 1985, and he started teaching there annually. In San Francisco from 1986 to 1989 he played with the Joel Rubin Klezmer Band, which included Michael Alpert and Stuart Brotman. In 1988, he started a new duo with accordionist Alan Bern, which Brotman and Alpert soon joined as well; the group eventually became Brave Old World. Rubin moved to Berlin, Germany in 1989; for the next three years, Brave Old World toured regularly in Europe, although in 1992 Rubin left the group.In 1994, he founded his next project, which still performs to this day, the Joel Rubin Ensemble, which includes Kálmán Balogh on cimbalom, David Chernyavsky on violin, and Claudio Jacomucci on accordion. (The violinist in the ensemble was also Steven Greenman for a time and is and currently Mark Kovnatskiy). He also began to perform as a duo with Joshua Horowitz, who was living in Austria at the time. In 1994, he recorded a cd with Horowitz (Bessarabian Symphony). Both that 1994 album and his subsequent Joel Rubin Ensemble cd Beregovski’s Khasene (1997) drew heavily on melodies collected by Soviet ethnomusicologist Moisei Beregovsky, which at that time were still not being performed much by Klezmer revival musicians.Since 2013, Rubin has been collaborating more frequently with the group Veretski Pass, releasing two albums with them, Poyln, A Gilgul (2015) and The Magid Chronicles (2019), which was based on the work of Sofia Magid.Over the years, Rubin has appeared on stage with a number of other traditional performers such as the Epstein Brothers, Moshe “Moussa” Berlin, Seymour Rexite and Miriam Kressyn, Leon Schwartz, Sid Beckerman, Pete Sokolow, Danny Rubinstein, Ben Bazyler, and Leopold Kozlowski, Vladimir Terletsky and Bronya Sakina. He has also appeared with Klezmer revival groups such as the Klezmer Conservatory Band, Daniel Kahn & the Painted Bird, The Klezmatics, and the Maxwell Street Klezmer Band. He has also directed some university klezmer ensembles, including the University of Virginia Klezmer Ensemble (of which he has been the director since 2006), the Syracuse University Klezmer Ensemble (in 2006), and the Cornell University Klezmer Ensemble (2003-6).


== Research and teaching ==
Rubin has been teaching klezmer music since KlezKamp was founded in 1985. He noted in a recent interview that there was very little information available in English about klezmer at that time, which motivated him to begin his own research into the genre in the early 1980s. Since then, he has become a prominent scholar of klezmer music, Hasidic music, and related genres of Jewish music. He began collaborating with Ethnomusicologist Rita Ottens in the early 1990s; they have since collaborated on a number of books. Rubin's research into the Epstein Brothers Orchestra in the 1990s led to the creation of a documentary film directed by Stefan Schwietert called A Tickle in the Heart (1996).
His 2001 dissertation at City University, London examined the performance style of klezmer clarinetists Dave Tarras and Naftule Brandwein. His most recent book, New York Klezmer in the Early Twentieth Century: The Music of Naftule Brandwein and Dave Tarras (U. of Rochester Press, 2020) revisits those two clarinetists.After finishing his PhD, in 2003 he returned to the United States and worked as an instructor at Cornell University and Ithaca College in Ithaca, New York. In 2006 he became an assistant professor at the University of Virginia where he worked until 2020. At present he is an Adjunct Researcher at the University of Bern.He has also published many academic papers, many of which are available on Academia.edu.
In 2021, Rubin deposited his collection of research materials and other documents with the Library of Congress American Folklife Center.

Muriel a oranžová smrt,"Muriel a oranžová smrt (in English: Muriel and the Orange Death) is a Czech comic album written by Miloš Macourek and drawn by Kája Saudek in 1969/1970. The story was inspired by the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. The album is the second and the last part of the planned cycle of adventures of young physician Muriel and her friend, angel Ró. It is considered one of the masterpieces of Czech comics. The 1st edition of the album was published in 2009, forty years after its creation, and sold out in four days.


== Background ==
Kája Saudek and Miloš Macourek first worked together in the early 1960s, as filmmakers. Inspired by the French Barbarella comic-book series, they began work on a cycle of graphic novels that featured a young, beautiful woman and a winged man (an 'angel'). The first installment, Muriel a andělé (Muriel and Angels), was announced in 1969, but not published until 1991. While the  second installment was being planned, Warsaw Pact forces invaded Czechoslovakia, in August 1968, and occupied the country, ending the Prague Spring liberalization period, and bringing about a restructure of the Czechoslovak communist regime. Faced with official repression and censorship, Czech authors, filmmakers and musicians reacted with a spate of ingeniously subversive new works: Macourek was no exception, and wove his own experience and opinions of Czechoslovakia's occupation into a new installment of Muriel's adventures. In the tightened communist censorship of the period, both installments met with official disapproval. Under the ""normalization"" of Czech society, comics - and particularly Saudek's - were considered bourgeois propaganda. Muriel a oranžová smrt was a flagrant satire against central communist authority.


== Plot ==
Muriel a oranžová smrt follows its characters on from where Muriel a andělé left them. The militaristic General Xeron, the main antagonist, has managed to escape justice. Both Muriel and Xeron are captured by a spy from the Orange Planet. Once at the Orange Planet, Muriel is imprisoned, but Xeron, true to character, unhesitatingly joins its autocratic ruling regime, and persuades its leader, the Central Brain, to invade Earth. After a brief, hopeless resistance, Earth is defeated; but Muriel's boyfriend Ró (a visitor from an alien planet of the distant future) contacts his compatriots and allies, and together, they drive the invaders back. Ró journeys to the Orange Planet, destroys its Central Brain, frees Muriel, and liberates the Planet's ordinary inhabitants, who have been unknowingly enslaved all the while.


== Symbolism ==
The Orange Planet reflects a prevalent Czechoslovak viewpoint on Soviet life during the 1960s: its men are depicted as ugly, malformed orange monsters, who serve a life of comfortable routine in the Planet's enormous army. Its women live a life of drudgery, at the service of heavy labour and heavy industry. The Planet is controlled by a dictator (The Central Brain) who brainwashes its inhabitants into obedience by means of implanted radio antennae. Saudek depicts the women with his characteristic sense of eroticism, usually half-naked and in sexually provocative poses. Czech comics expert Tomáš Prokůpek claims that this is probably the first Czech comic to depict naked female breasts. 
By 1970, it was ready for publication but in the atmosphere of Husakian ""normalization"", the publication of a comic whose main theme was an invasion of monsters from the Orange Planet invited ""political suicide"".Despite the restrictions of ""normalisation"", Macourek and Saudek continued their collaboration, mingling film and comic-book artistic conventions. Saudek designed the 1970 film production Čtyři vraždy stačí, drahoušku (Four Murders is Enough, Honey: screenplay by Macourek); the film employed graphic elements from a comic book developed in tandem. The influence of Muriel and the Orange Death is apparent in Saudek's next work, the comic album Lips Tullian. Eventually, this too was banned. Muriel a oranžová smrt was published only in 2009, two years after Saudek suffered an accident and fell into a coma, and forty years after its creation. It sold out in four days, and is considered one of the masterpieces of Czech comics.


== Style ==
Saudek employs visual techniques that were unusually inventive for their day, derived from film editing and story-boarding, with heightened and wide-screen perspectives, recurrent motifs and a strong narrative style. Leading characters are based on real-life models: Muriel herself was based on the Czech film star Olga Schoberová (Saudek's former fiancée), and her antagonist, the militant general Ian Xeron, on Saudek's twin brother, the photographer Jan Saudek. A character called Nurse Haney is based on Saudek's wife, Hana. Other minor characters are taken from Western comic-books; Archie Andrews, Jughead Jones, Alfred E. Neuman and Batman inhabit Muriel's world, which is rich with in-jokes, double entendres and hidden meanings, typical of Saudek's work.

The assault was spearheaded by Royal Marines of the British 3 Commando Brigade, augmented by U.S. Marines of the American 15th MEU and Polish JW GROM troops. Iraqi forces in the old town of Umm Qasr put up unexpectedly strong resistance, requiring several days' fighting before the area was cleared of defenders. The port was finally declared safe and reopened on 25 March 2003.


== Background ==
Umm Qasr consists of a densely inhabited town connected to a port, with a population of 43,000. The port's role grew during the Iran–Iraq War. Following the 1991 uprising in Basra, Saddam Hussein decided to punish Basra by focusing development on Umm Qasr. By 2003, it had a modern port with a large dock and a channel that could dock ocean-going ships. It handled 3,500 tonnes of UN-organized oil-for-food humanitarian aid every day following the Gulf War.The task of capturing Umm Qasr was given to U.S. Marines from the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit, who were under the command of Brigadier Jim Dutton,There was an intelligence report that Iraqi T-72 tanks from the Republican Guard's, Medina Division, had been seen cutting off Umm Qasr from the main roads Basra and Safwan, so the U.S. Marines detached an armored unit to the 15th MEU in the event that the intelligence proved correct.


== Battle ==
The initial assault was carried out on 21 March by the 15th MEU and the British 26th Armored Engineer Squadron. The U.S. Marine convoy made of 20 vehicles received Iraqi small arms and mortar fire, forcing the lead company to call in supporting fire from the Royal Artillery, whose shells were eventually able to neutralize the mortar positions. The U.S. Marines withdrew from the area as they were too close to the target and, after 3 or 4 hours, the 15th MEU, reinforced by two Abrams tanks continued their advance to Umm Qasr.U.S. Marines entered the town and spread out towards the port. There was occasional small arms fire from Iraqi soldiers but no organized resistance and around 200 Iraqi soldiers surrendered. Later on that day, there was increased sniping from Iraqi troops and 1 Marine was killed.U.S. secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld announced at a press conference in The Pentagon that the port of Umm Qasr was secured. On 22 March U.S Marines, believing there was no further resistance in the town, moved on to the port area, clearing the railway lines and industrial areas.On the morning of 23 March, a U.S patrol near the town was fired on by Iraqi snipers. While returning fire they reported Iraqi forces moving into one of the warehouses in the industrial area. The patrol called in tanks which fired on the Iraqi positions. Intense machine-gun and RPG fire directed at the US Marines prevented them moving forward to identify their targets, so they called in air support. 2 RAF harriers responded, launching airstrikes on the Iraqi-occupied buildings. Machine gun fire died down, but the Marines came under increased sniper fire from the town. The fighting continued into the night when the Marines were unable to make any progress against the Iraqi forces. Navy Seals and SWCC teams would take several dozen Iraqi prisoners off abandoned boats in the waterways near Umm Qasr. American officials said it was not clear whether those prisoners were soldiers trying to flee combat in the region or Iraqi commandos plotting to mount guerrilla attacks against American and British forces around Umm Qasr or in Fao. After several missions with specific targets carried out by SEALs and SWCC Teams the remaining resistance was finished off.
The Navy Seals and SWCC would later hand over the remaining Iraqi prisoners to British Royal Marines at Umm Qasr for detention.
Brigadier Dutton knew the 15th MEU needed more time but they were scheduled to join up with the I Marine Expeditionary Force within the next 2 days, so he decided to relieve the unit and that 42 Commando could take over. On the night of 24 March, M company, 42 Commando, patrolled through the town and port after receiving occasional rifle fire and cleared a Ba'ath Party headquarters in the center of the town, the following day another patrol cleared Iraqi defensive positions, finding that the Iraqi troops had left the town.


== Aftermath ==
Following the seizure of the town and port, the waterway was de-mined by a detachment from HM-14 and Naval Special Clearance Team ONE of the U.S. Navy and reopened. Using Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats (RIBs), the Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen (SWCC) of SBT 20 assisted in the capture of the Iraqi port city, Umm Qasr, with follow-on force protection of the port. As the waters came under the protection of the coalition forces, SBT 20 detachments served a crucial role in securing oil delivery stations along the gulf throughout the myriad of mine fields. Umm Qasr played an important role in the shipment of humanitarian supplies to Iraqi civilians.Coalition minesweepers, including HMS Bangor and HMS Sandown (aided by divers), US Navy MH-53E helicopters, and trained dolphins, located the approach to the port and cleared it of mines, allowing RFA Sir Galahad to dock after a couple of days. The first minesweeper HMS Brocklesby found 80 Manta mines laid out close to the shipping lane, they were destroyed in a controlled detonation.

Angeline Fuller Fischer,"Angeline Fuller Fischer (August 11, 1841 – April 2, 1925) was an American writer. She is considered one of the earliest deaf feminists due to her advocacy for the equal education of deaf women. Her poems and articles were published in publications across the United States; in 1908 the newspaper The Silent Worker called Fischer ""one of America's great deaf poets"".


== Early life and education ==
Angeline Ashby Fuller was born in Savanna, Illinois on August 11, 1841. She attended local schools until the spring of 1854, when she lost her hearing after becoming ill with whooping cough and typhoid fever. Her family was unaware of any special education available for the deaf, but after seeing an article in the Northwestern Christian Advocate in 1859 she applied to the school for the deaf in Jacksonville, Illinois.She was eighteen years old when she began attending the Illinois School for the Deaf. She began writing her first poems and her teachers recognized and encouraged her to continue developing her talent for poetry. Severe problems with her sight caused by her earlier illness plagued her throughout her life. Spells of blindness and other illness cut her education short and she spent only two years at the school.


== Advocacy for deaf women ==
After leaving school, Fischer developed an interest in helping the deaf community. She raised funds for St. Ann's Church for the Deaf in New York City. She instructed several deafblind children and in 1880 took a position as a residential dean at the Texas School for the Deaf, but poor health required her to return to her family's home in Savanna. After writing articles in the Deaf-Mutes' Journal, a publication offering advice and support to deaf women, Fischer became the leading feminist in the deaf community of the United States.Fischer attended the first convention of the National Association of the Deaf, arguing for the participation of women in NAD. She met her future husband at the convention: George E. Fischer was the deaf editor of a county newspaper. They married in May 1887 and lived in Omaha, Nebraska.In 1886, Fischer and Georgia Elliott began a letter-writing campaign to argue for admitting women to Gallaudet. Fischer threatened to start a separate deaf women's college as far from Gallaudet as possible if the administrators did not change their policy. In response, Gallaudet agreed to admit six women in 1887.


== Writing ==
Her book of verse, The Venture, published in 1883, was one of the first literary accounts from a deaf perspective. Fischer wrote that deafness or blindness could not be understood solely as a hardship or a lack of ability. Ideas she presented in her poetry were so radical that they would take over a century to be revisited by scholars; these include the concept that deaf and disabled people have played central roles in foundational texts (such as the Bible), as well as arguing that disability was not located within individuals but as a result of the societal conditions that did not meet everyone's communication needs. Fischer's friends Oliver Wendell Holmes and John Greenleaf Whittier gave favorable reviews to the book.Fischer was considered one of the leading deaf writers of her era. One of her sonnets was featured in Harper's Monthly Magazine and her poems were featured in several anthologies. She published articles and verse in newspapers such as The Wisconsin Times, the Omaha Monitor, and the Thorold Post (Ontario). Fischer also managed a distributing agency with her husband. When her husband died in July 1904, she moved to live with her sister in Rockford, Illinois, and continued to write poetry and articles for the deaf community. She advocated for establishing a home for elderly deaf people. Her last article in The Silent Worker was a 1915 call for a memorial to Sophia Fowler Gallaudet in honor of Gallaudet's many contributions to the education for the deaf.Fischer died on April 2, 1925. Her efforts in promoting deaf women's rights have earned Fischer the recognition by disability scholars as one of the first deaf feminists.

Square and Circle Club,"{{advert|date=May 2023}
The Square and Circle Club is a women's community service organization located in San Francisco. Founded in 1924, it is the oldest Chinese women's community service club in the United States. Throughout its history, the club has been active in its support of numerous San Francisco Chinatown community organizations and philanthropic causes.
Many of the club's members have been influential in the San Francisco Chinatown community. The club notes its founder Alice Fong Yu, who was the first Chinese American public school teacher in San Francisco,  and Alice G. Lowe, the first Chinese American Commissioner and Chair of San Francisco's Asian Art Museum.


== Name and Symbology ==
The club's name comes from Chinese proverb meaning ""In deeds be square, in knowledge be all-round"". The name was suggested by founding member Alice Fong Yu's Chinese language tutor, Professor Fung Gee Shau. The club's symbol follows this motif, taking on the iconography of a round ancient Chinese bass coin with square markings in the center.


== Founding ==
The Square and Circle Club was founded in 1924 by seven young Chinese American women who were members of the Chinese Congressional Church, now known as the Chinese Congregational United Church of Christ. The seven original founding members were first president Alice Fong Yu, Anne Lee Leong, Ivy Lee Mah, Bessie Wong Shum, Daisy K. Wong and Daisy L. Wong. The group soon expanded to sixteen members, and would continue to grow before stabilizing at encompassing an average of eighty members at any given time.The Square and Circle Clubs status as the first Chinese American women's service organization allowed its early members to invent a new tradition in the public service club space. The club was the first Chinese American women's service club to exist as its own independent entity rather than a women's axillary branch of a church or men's service organization. As such, early members of the club were able to decide for themselves what this kind of women's service club should be. While they were certainly influenced by both the Chinese and American traditions of women's public service, they had no strict models to base their organization off of, allowing them the freedom to innovate for themselves.


== Membership ==
Like its founding membership, the club has primarily consisted of American-born Chinese American business and professional women, though it has been open to women of all races and backgrounds. As such, the club has always had a strong focus on the Chinese American community of San Francisco and the bicultural identity of its membership.The Square and Circle Club's original association with the Chinese Congressional Church has also influenced the organization. Many club members, particularly in their earlier years, have cited Christianity as a significant influence on their philanthropic and community organizing efforts. However, the club has never required members to be Christian and has never served as a proselytizing force. While the organization has Christian roots, the primary force connecting its members has been a shared cultural identity and desire to improve their community rather than a shared religion.Membership in the Square and Circle Club is often long-term. Founding members stayed active in the organization well into their late seventies and eighties, and many others served as part of the club for decades. Many members join the organization as young professionals in their twenties and remain part of the club for most of their lives. Often there is a gap where members resign in mid-adulthood due to increased work and family obligations but then come back to become members of the club again once they have finished raising their families and are closer to retirement.


== History ==


=== Early Fundraising Activities ===
The impetus behind the club's founding was its founding members' desire to raise money for flood and famine victims in China. To that end, the Club held its first benefit dance on September 21, 1924, and raised over $250, the equivalent of US$3,872.47 today.
Starting in 1926, the club began to have two benefit events per year to raise money for international philanthropic causes. Their original 1926 fundraiser was a hope chest raffle, with the prize chest being filled with hand embroidered linens sewn by club members. Now, fundraising events have been expanded to include a variety of activities, including ""carnivals, dances, fashion shows, raffles, rummage sales, teas, and cookbook publications"".The club has also put on a number of well received plays, musicals and variety shows, with the proceeds donated to charity. The first of these shows was performed in 1933 in conjunction with and for the benefit of the Chung Mei Home for Chinese Boys. The show was a musical comedy entitled ""It Happened in Zandavia"". The musical was shown multiple times to high acclaim, and ended its run with a successful showing at the War Memorial Auditorium in San Francisco's Civic Center.


=== Wartime Efforts ===
Like many other organizations in the Chinese American community at the time, the Square and Circle Club was a strong supporter of the Chinese war effort against Japanese Imperialism during WWII. From the 1930s on forward, the Square and Circle Club raised large amounts of money for relief efforts benefiting Chinese war refugees. These fundraisers were often done in collaboration with other Chinatown organizations such as the War Relief Committee of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association and the United China War Relief Association of America. Club members also worked to provide supplies for the Chinese war effort, volunteered for organizations like the Red Cross, and participated in political activities such as protests, parades, and lobbying efforts aimed at pressuring Congress to declare a trade embargo against Japan.The club became mainly involved with holding fashion show benefits for the war effort and leading the boycott against Japanese-made silk stockings. The fashion shows were top-rated, and were taken on the road to smaller towns outside San Francisco.  As well as raising funds for the war effort, these shows also spread an appreciation for Chinese culture as club members exposed large audiences to elaborate Chinese outfits ranging from the Tang Dynasty to the modern day.The Square and Circle Club's participation in the silk boycott, or ""Non-Silk Movement"", was part of a larger, national effort to boycott Japanese silk, which was one of the nation's main exports. In San Francisco, the Square and Circle Club was the main force behind promoting and organizing the local component of this national boycott, giving it more attention than other, majority male Chinatown organizations did at the time. The club ran multiple promotions in both local and national publications showing club members wearing lisle stockings, a popular alternative to silk. In these advertisements, the club encouraged women to ""'Be in style, wear lisle"". The boycott was also heavily promoted by then president Alice Fong Yu's' in the Chinese Digest through her column the ""Jade Box""  .
Once the United States officially entered WWII in 1941, the Square and Circle Club also began activities to support the US war effort in the Pacific. These activities included ""sponsor[ing] dances for Chinese American soldiers on leave, act[ing] as hostesses for the Y.W.CA's U.S.O. (United Services Organization) program, and participat[ing] in Red Cross activities"". The club also became involved in selling war bonds and another financial fundraising that supported the US war effort.


=== Early Media Representation ===
From its earliest beginnings, the Square and Circle Club gained high acclaim from media circles. In 1926, only two years after the club's founding, the Square and Circle Club was given glowing praise from Los Angeles Record columnist Louis Leung, who wrote of the club:
""Whenever there is a flood in China, or an orphan to look after, or the poor to remember – the Square and Circle Club of twenty-four Chinese girls can always be counted on to carry out its motto of service. There are other clubs and organizations in Chinatown, lots of them, but this handful of girls has led them all in sterling service to the community and to their country. Most young girls band together for social purposes chiefly, but not so the Square and Circle members. They have two projects each year in their program of ministering to the needs of their less fortunate countrymen.""


== Social Reform and Advocacy ==
The Square and Circle Club has always been an organization dedicated to social reform. Through both its general philanthropic activities and policy advocacy, the club has grounded many of its activities in Chinese and Asian American issues, as well as women's issues within that community.


=== Chinese and Asian American Advocacy ===
While the club has been more focused on philanthropy than explicit policy issues, the Square and Circle Club has been an active force regarding a number of social and political causes over the years. As previously stated, the club was highly invested in support for China during WWII through fundraising and boycotts of Japanese goods. During this time period, the club was also active in the fight against domestic discrimination against Chinese and Chinese Americans. To this end, the club promoted bills regarding immigration rights and US citizenship for those of Chinese origin in America, something that was at the time restricted by anti-Asian immigration laws such as the Chinese Exclusion Act and the Immigration Act of 1924. The club also took an active part in local politics by lobbying for better community infrastructure in Chinatown, as well as working with other organizations to register Chinese Americans to vote.In its more general activities, much of the work and causes supported by the Square and Circle Club over the years have been grounded in local Asian American and San Francisco Chinatown community issues. Club member Ruth Chinn emphasized the club's community-based focus as her motivation for public service, saying ""'That is my theory---of giving back to the community what life has given me"". In addition to providing money and service for local causes, the club's dedication to the community has manifested itself by providing funding for internships in over a dozen San Francisco nonprofits that serve the Asian American community through the “Square and Circle Club Civic Engagement Internship” program.While its original membership was primarily American-born Chinese Americans, the Square and Circle Club has never been ethnicity-exclusive. Its openness toward non-Chinese members and interest in cross-cultural interaction set it apart from many Chinese men's organizations that were in operation at the time of the club's founding. Over time, the club's interests and member base have expanded from being primarily Chinese American to encompassing a larger Asian American perspective.


=== Chinese and Asian American Women’s Advocacy ===
The Square and Circle Club has continually shown a dedication to improving the welfare of Asian American women. Since its founding, the club has “advocated social change by supporting women's financial independence, education, and protection against domestic violence”. Past programs that have benefited Asian American women have included the Square and Circle Club's Friendship Fund, which provided monetary aid for Asian American women in need. This fund was active from the 1930s to the 1960s. Their general fundraising activities have also often benefited organizations that focus on Asian American women, such as the Asian Women's Shelter, the Gum Moon Women's Residence, and the Ming Quong Chinese Girls' Orphanage among many others.


== Membership Support ==
The Square and Circle Club is a tight knit group that values long-term relationships within its membership. This feeling of sisterhood is demonstrated by passage in the Square and Circle Club's 50th anniversary book describing the club as being:
“as much a part of our lives as if it were a member of our family. We love it (always) and hate it (at times) passionately, faithfully, openly. We shed 'blood, sweat and tears' for it without question. New members we embrace as sisters, and when one of us leaves us, it is as if she were our own flesh and blood.""
This feeling of camaraderie and sisterhood is enhanced by the club's function as a service organization that allows members to work together to achieve larger goal. As such, the club has been able to provide both a community driven purpose and social support for its members for close to a century.
In addition, the Square and Circle Club has served as a space for its members to explore Chinese and Asian American identity. Many early members have expressed the feeling of being a “bridge between the old and the new” and being “very comfortable in both [Chinese and American] cultures"". The Square and Circle Club, which frequently engaged in both Chinese and American cultural activities, provided a space for members to express both facets of their identity without abandoning one for the other.


== Personal Development and Leadership Training ==
The Square and Circle Club has taken pride in providing leadership training and opportunities for its membership. The club requires a high level of involvement from its members, with attendance required at many events and monthly meetings. Members have also been required to serve on the board of directors within five years of joining and to serve as officer or a committee at least once every five years after this initial period. This level of required engagement has made it so every member has been an active part of running the club with opportunities to lead projects and committees. In this way, all members are given the opportunity to learn both hard and soft leadership skills that range from creating complex budgets to negotiating between different factions working on a large project. One early club member has remarked that her membership in the Square and Circle Club allowed her to take on “’responsibilities which would not have been possible in [her] regular job’” that have “‘enabled [her] to take on responsibilities with confidence’”. These opportunities have been extended to younger women in the community through the club's Junior chapter, providing leadership training to interested girls at a younger age.

Subsequently, the Raj Bhavan was shifted to the Barnes' Court building. The Peterhof was rebuilt to a new design as a luxury hotel in 1991. It has 34 suites. Seventeen rooms of the hotel are owned by Himachal Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (HPTDC) and the rest are reserved for the governor, chief minister, state guests and general administration department.

Capricorn One,"Capricorn One is a 1977 British-produced American thriller film in which a reporter discovers that a supposed Mars landing by a crewed mission to the planet has been faked via a conspiracy involving the government and—under duress—the crew themselves. It was written and directed by Peter Hyams and produced by Lew Grade's ITC Entertainment. It stars Elliott Gould as the reporter, and James Brolin, Sam Waterston, and O. J. Simpson as the astronauts. Hal Holbrook plays a senior NASA official who goes along with governmental and corporate interests and helps to fake the mission.
The music score was created by Jerry Goldsmith.


== Plot ==
Capricorn One—the first crewed mission to Mars—is on the launch pad. Just before liftoff, astronauts Charles Brubaker, Peter Willis, and John Walker are suddenly removed from the spacecraft. Bewildered, they are flown to an abandoned military base in the desert. The launch proceeds on schedule, with the public unaware the spacecraft is empty.
At the base, NASA official Kelloway informs the astronauts that a faulty life-support system would have killed them in-flight. He says they must help counterfeit the televised footage during the flight to and from Mars. Another failed space mission would result in NASA's funding being cut and private contractors losing millions in profits. Kelloway threatens their families to force their cooperation.
The astronauts remain captive during the flight and appear to be filmed after landing on Mars, although they are actually inside of a makeshift TV studio at the base. At the command center, only a few officials know about the conspiracy until an alert technician, Elliot Whitter, notices that ground control receives the crew's televised transmissions before the spacecraft telemetry arrives. Whitter reports this to his supervisors, including Kelloway, but is told it is due to a faulty workstation. Whitter partially shares his concerns with a TV journalist friend, Robert Caulfield. Whitter suddenly vanishes, and when Caulfield goes to Whitter's apartment the next day, he discovers someone else living there and that all evidence of Whitter's recent life has been erased. As Caulfield investigates, several attempts are made on his life.
Upon returning to Earth, the empty spacecraft burns up during atmospheric reentry due to a faulty heat shield, which would have killed the astronauts had they been on board. The astronauts realize officials will need to kill them to keep the hoax a secret. They escape in a small jet which quickly runs out of fuel, forcing a crash-landing in the desert. They split up on foot to increase their chances of finding help and exposing the plot. Kelloway sends helicopters after them. Willis and Walker are found, while Brubaker evades capture.
Caulfield interviews Brubaker's ""widow"" after reviewing a televised conversation between the astronauts and their wives. Mrs. Brubaker had seemed confused when her husband mentioned their last family vacation. She explains that the family had actually gone to a different location, where a western movie was being filmed. Brubaker was intrigued by how special effects and technology made it seem real.
Caulfield believes Brubaker would never make such a mistake and may have been sending his wife a message. Caulfield goes to the deserted western movie set and is shot at. As he investigates further, federal agents break into his home, arresting him for possessing cocaine that they planted there. His exasperated boss bails Caulfield out, then fires him.
A reporter friend tells Caulfield about an abandoned military base located 300 miles (480 km) from Houston. The base is deserted, but Caulfield finds Brubaker's necklace and medallion and concludes the astronauts were there. Caulfield hires a crop-dusting pilot named Albain to search the desert. They spot and follow two helicopters to a closed isolated gas station where Brubaker is hiding. They rescue him as he attempts to escape his pursuers. The helicopters chase their plane through a canyon but crash when Albain blinds them with crop spray.
Ultimately, Caulfield and Brubaker arrive at the astronauts' memorial service, where Kelloway and Brubaker's wife see them and live network TV coverage exposes the truth.

=== Development ===
Peter Hyams began thinking about a film of a space hoax while working on broadcasts of the Apollo missions for CBS. He later reflected regarding the Apollo 11 Moon landing, ""There was one event of really enormous importance that had almost no witnesses. And the only verification we have ... came from a TV camera.""He later elaborated:

Whenever there was something on the news about a [space flight], they would cut to a studio in St. Louis where there was a simulation of what was going on. I grew up in the generation where my parents basically believed if it was in the newspaper it was true. That turned out to be bullshit. My generation was brought up to believe television was true, and that was bullshit too. So I was watching these simulations and I wondered what would happen if someone faked a whole story.
Hyams wrote the script in 1972 but no one wanted to make it. He says interest in the script was re-activated by the Watergate Scandal. He approached producer Paul Lazarus. Hyams and Lazarus had a meeting with Lew Grade, head of production company ITC Entertainment who had recently moved into film production with The Return of the Pink Panther. Grade agreed to make the film after only five minutes. The budget was $4.8 million.Grade announced the film in October 1975 as a part of a slate of ten films he intended to make over the next 12 months, including The Domino Principle, Action - Clear the Fast Lanes and Juarez. The last two were ultimately not made.To stay within the budget, NASA's co-operation was needed. Lazarus had a good relationship with the space agency from Futureworld. The filmmakers were thus able to obtain government equipment as props, including a prototype Apollo Lunar Module, despite the story's negative portrayal of the space agency.
In September 1976, it was announced the cast would include Elliott Gould, O.J. Simpson, James Brolin, Brenda Vaccaro, and Candice Bergen. The presence of Brolin and Simpson in the cast helped secure a presale to NBC. Ultimately Bergen pulled out and was replaced by Karen Black.


=== Shooting ===
Filming started in January 1977. Shooting locations included Cinema Center Films in Studio City, and Red Rock Canyon State Park.Hyams later joked, ""O. J. Simpson was in it, and Robert Blake was in Busting [Hyams' first feature]. I've said many times: Some people have AFI Lifetime Achievement awards; some people have multiple Oscars; my bit of trivia is that I've made films with two leading men who were subsequently tried for the first-degree murder of their wives.""


== Release ==
The film originally was scheduled to debut in the United States in February 1978, but good preview screenings and delays in Superman caused it to move to June. Capricorn One became the year's most-successful independent film.Hyams later said:

Audiences just stood up and cheered at one point in the film. It wasn't because it was such a great movie, it's just that certain movies strike certain chords with people. In a successful movie, the audience, almost before they see it, know they're going to like it. I remember standing in the back of the theater and crying because I knew that something had changed in my life. Sitting on the film cans outside the screening room, I felt my cheeks were wet with tears. A bright man, [studio executive] David Picker came over to me and said, 'You're going to have a lot of new best friends tomorrow. You better know how to handle it.'
In Japan and the UK, a version with a running time of 129 minutes was released theatrically, with additional scenes such as the docking of the spacecraft during the Mars landing, and with different cuts of detail. However, the rights company (ITC Entertainment) has since taken the position that the final version of ""Capricorn One"" is the 123-minute version currently in circulation, and that the 129-minute version no longer exists. Therefore, only the 123-minute version is currently distributed in Japan and the UK. However, in 2019, film material from the 129-minute version was discovered at the National Film Archive of Japan, so remastered material was created based on this film and released as ""bonus content"" only on Japanese Blu-ray, after obtaining special permission from the rights company.


== Reception ==
Vincent Canby of The New York Times called the film ""an expensive, stylistically bankrupt suspense melodrama"" while describing much of its screenplay as ""humorless comic-strip stuff."" Conversely, Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and called it ""a surprisingly good thriller"" with a runaway car sequence ""that provides some of the best action footage I've seen in a long time."" Variety faulted the film's ""underdeveloped script"" and ""scattershot casting"", calling the duo of Savalas and Gould ""a bullseye"" but Waterston and Simpson lacking in ""group chemistry"".Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times thought the beginning of the film was the best part, and what follows ""is wildly uneven, veering between the serious and the merely silly, and ending up likely to please only the least demanding."" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote, ""Capricorn One harks back to the old adventure serials, but Hyams doesn't have remotely enough wit or technique to achieve a fresh stylization of vintage formulas.""Richard Combs of The Monthly Film Bulletin stated ""Somewhere within this flabby, overproduced fantasy about space-age double-dealing and Watergate-type sleuthing lives a smaller, tighter film—and a much wittier satire on the space program and technologies, like Hollywood, designed to deceive and manipulate. The trouble is that this more ideal version is not really struggling to get out but wallowing complacently in the limitless excess that has become the Lew Grade trademark.""In a retrospective review, AllMovie critic Donald Guarisco wrote: ""This agreeable high-concept effort is one of Peter Hyams' most accomplished films. The script's conspiracy-theory premise requires a major suspension of disbelief, but Hyams makes it worthwhile for those willing to make that leap.""Capricorn One holds a 65% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 23 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The site's consensus states: ""A string of questionable plot contrivances threaten to bury its story, but Capricorn One manages to unfurl an amusing, sharply cynical conspiracy yarn.""


== Other media ==

Two novelizations of the film were written and published by separate authors. The first was written by Ken Follett (under the pseudonym Bernard L. Ross) and published in the United Kingdom; the other was written by Ron Goulart and published in the United States.The Follett novel is notable for giving Robert Caulfield more development than the movie does, including giving him something of a relationship with CBS reporter Judy Drinkwater (who has more time in the book than in the movie) and ending the book with him and Judy. The story saves his career and results in his being employed by CBS.
Clips from the faked Mars landing scenes have been used for illustration purposes in various Moon landing hoax conspiracy documentaries, notably the Fox TV show Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon and Bart Sibrel's film A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon (2001). The latter also features a still shot from the hoax scene on the DVD's front cover.
In 2020–2021, Capricorn One was used as part of an internet prank. A viral video purported to be released by WikiLeaks was uploaded to BitChute, Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms and blogs with a title: ""Wikileaks releases - Moon landing cut scene - filmed in Nevada desert"". In fact, WikiLeaks released no such video. Close inspection revealed this prank video to be made using clips from Capricorn One and even various film reels shot on the set of Capricorn One, which were then cut and spliced with stock footage from the Apollo missions and training sessions.

Transportation Alternatives,"Transportation Alternatives (TransAlt, formerly T.A.) is a non-profit organization in New York City which works to change New York City's transportation priorities to encourage and increase non-polluting, quiet, city-friendly travel and decrease automobile use. TransAlt seeks a transportation system based on a ""Green Transportation Hierarchy"" giving preference to modes of travel based on their relative benefits and costs to society. To achieve these goals, T.A. works in five areas: Cycling, Walking and Traffic Calming, Car-Free Parks, Safe Streets and Sustainable Transportation.  Promotional activities include large group bicycle rides.


== History ==
Transportation Alternatives was founded in 1973 during the explosion of environmental consciousness that also produced the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act and the National Environmental Policy Act. Since its founding, TransAlt has helped win numerous improvements for cyclists and pedestrians and has become the leading voice for cycling and walking in New York City and a model for livable streets advocacy across the United States. TransAlt's roots are in cycling in New York City, and many of its members are everyday cyclists. A bicycle friendly city means changing the overall transportation system, which, even in New York City where more people use public transit than cars, means shifting a paradigm dominated by the private automobile. The expression/phrase One Less Car was coined and given to TA by Richard Rosenthal around 1981. Since 2014, TransAlt has been at the forefront of monitoring New York City's Vision Zero initiative and advocating for progress in meeting safety goals.


== Past successes ==
Since its creation, Transportation Alternatives has helped achieve goals including:

A new two-way bike lane on the Brooklyn Bridge
Pedestrian and bicycling paths on all East River Bridges for the first time in 50 years
A complete Hudson River Greenway, eleven miles of car-free walking and cycling along the Hudson River
A promise of a Manhattan Waterfront Greenway, a car-free path circling the entirety of Manhattan
A permanently car-free Prospect Park.
A permanently car-free Central Park.
Publication of a 160-page New York City bicycle master plan, The Bicycle Blueprint
Legal bike access on New York City Subway and New Jersey Transit, including 24/7 access to the subway
New Manhattan access to the Brooklyn Bridge promenade and ramped access to the entire path
Pedestrian safety improvements on Queens Boulevard
Pedestrian improvements in Herald Square and Times Square
The Bronx's Safe Routes to School: Pedestrian improvements at 38 Bronx schools
Creation of NYC DOT citywide Safe Schools Program
800 speed bumps on neighborhood streets
Numerous new bike lanes throughout NYC
Bicycle racks on city streets throughout NYC
Legal bicycle access to the George Washington Bridge
Secure bike parking at several midtown garages
Pedestrian and cyclist access to River Road on the New Jersey Palisades
Overturn of a proposed 1987 midtown bicycle ban


== Volunteer support ==
Transportation Alternatives relies on thousands of volunteers activists to achieve its goals. While many support TransAlt's bike tours, many more help as part of the organization's eight active borough activist committees, representing The Bronx, Brooklyn, Staten Island, Queens, and Manhattan.


== Current initiatives ==
Transportation Alternatives' current campaigns are numerous. They include:

Pedestrian safety:  TransAlt is pushing for 20 mph zones in various neighborhoods, as well as more speed limit enforcement.
Expanding the bicycle network: encouraging the city to continue their expansion of  bike lanes, particularly on-street protected bike lanes, which have been shown to reduce injuries of all street users, including motorists.  T.A. is also advocating for New York City to implement a robust bike share system, akin to Paris' highly successful Vélib' system.
Improving bicyclist behavior: TransAlt has distributed tens of thousands of their ""Biking Rules"" booklets in English, Spanish and Chinese, and has sponsored a Biking Rules PSA Film Festival, among other initiatives.
The Vision Zero Street Design Standard is a plan to planning, designing, and building streets that can save lives.
Ongoing petition creation for users/members and petition drives.


== Events ==
Transportation Alternatives produces a number of bike tours throughout the year, including the NYC Century Bike Tour and the Tour de Staten Island.  In addition to fundraising, the purpose of these tours is to introduce New Yorkers to bicycling around the city and to give the confidence and inspiration to take up biking as a regular activity.
TransAlt also puts on a number of other events including the Vision Zero Cities conference, benefits, parties, lectures and other events.

Political cartoon,"A political cartoon,  also known as an editorial cartoon, is a cartoon graphic with caricatures of public figures, expressing the artist's opinion. An artist who writes and draws such images is known as an editorial cartoonist. They typically combine artistic skill, hyperbole and satire in order to either question authority or draw attention to corruption, political violence and other social ills.Developed in England in the latter part of the 18th century, the political cartoon was pioneered by James Gillray, although his and others in the flourishing English industry were sold as individual prints in print shops.  Founded in 1841, the British periodical Punch appropriated the term cartoon to refer to its political cartoons, which led to the term's widespread use.


== History ==


=== Origins ===
The pictorial satire has been credited as the precursor to the political cartoons in England: John J. Richetti, in The Cambridge history of English literature, 1660–1780, states that ""English graphic satire really begins with Hogarth's Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme"". William Hogarth's pictures combined social criticism with sequential artistic scenes. A frequent target of his satire was the corruption of early 18th century British politics. An early satirical work was an Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme (c.1721), about the disastrous stock market crash of 1720 known as the South Sea Bubble, in which many English people lost a great deal of money.His art often had a strong moralizing element to it, such as in his masterpiece of 1732–33, A Rake's Progress, engraved in 1734. It consisted of eight pictures that depicted the reckless life of Tom Rakewell, the son of a rich merchant, who spends all of his money on luxurious living, services from sex workers, and gambling—the character's life ultimately ends in Bethlem Royal Hospital.However, his work was only tangentially politicized and was primarily regarded on its artistic merits. George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend produced some of the first overtly political cartoons and caricatures in the 1750s.


=== Development ===
The medium began to develop in England in the latter part of the 18th century—especially around the time of the French Revolution—under the direction of its great exponents, James Gillray and Thomas Rowlandson, both from London. Gillray explored the use of the medium for lampooning and caricature, and has been referred to as the father of the political cartoon. Calling the king, prime ministers and generals to account, many of Gillray's satires were directed against George III, depicting him as a pretentious buffoon, while the bulk of his work was dedicated to ridiculing the ambitions of Revolutionary France and Napoleon. The times in which Gillray lived were peculiarly favourable to the growth of a great school of caricature. Party warfare was carried on with great vigour and not a little bitterness; and personalities were freely indulged in on both sides. Gillray's incomparable wit and humour, knowledge of life, fertility of resource, keen sense of the ludicrous, and beauty of execution, at once gave him the first place among caricaturists.George Cruikshank became the leading cartoonist in the period following Gillray (1820s–40s). His early career was renowned for his social caricatures of English life for popular publications. He gained notoriety with his political prints that attacked the royal family and leading politicians and was bribed in 1820 ""not to caricature His Majesty"" (George IV) ""in any immoral situation"". His work included a personification of England named John Bull who was developed from about 1790 in conjunction with other British satirical artists such as Gillray and Rowlandson.


=== Cartoonist's magazines ===
The art of the editorial cartoon was further developed with the publication of the British periodical Punch in 1841, founded by Henry Mayhew and engraver Ebenezer Landells (an earlier magazine that published cartoons was Monthly Sheet of Caricatures, printed from 1830 and an important influence on Punch). It was bought by Bradbury and Evans in 1842, who capitalised on newly evolving mass printing technologies to turn the magazine into a preeminent national institution. The term ""cartoon"" to refer to comic drawings was coined by the magazine in 1843; the Houses of Parliament were to be decorated with murals, and ""carttons"" for the mural were displayed for the public; the term ""cartoon"" then meant a finished preliminary sketch on a large piece of cardboard, or cartone in Italian.  Punch humorously appropriated the term to refer to its political cartoons, and the popularity of the Punch cartoons led to the term's widespread use.Artists who published in Punch during the 1840s and 50s included John Leech, Richard Doyle, John Tenniel and Charles Keene. This group became known as ""The Punch Brotherhood"", which also included Charles Dickens who joined Bradbury and Evans after leaving Chapman and Hall in 1843. Punch authors and artists also contributed to another Bradbury and Evans literary magazine called Once A Week (est.1859), created in response to Dickens' departure from Household Words.The most prolific and influential cartoonist of the 1850s and 60s was John Tenniel, chief cartoon artist for Punch, who perfected the art of physical caricature and representation to a point that has changed little up to the present day. For over five decades he was a steadfast social witness to the sweeping national changes that occurred during this period alongside his fellow cartoonist John Leech. The magazine loyally captured the general public mood; in 1857, following the Indian Rebellion and the public outrage that followed, Punch published vengeful illustrations such as Tenniel's Justice and The British Lion's Vengeance on the Bengal Tiger.


=== Maturation ===
By the mid-19th century, major political newspapers in many countries featured cartoons designed to express the publisher's opinion on the politics of the day. One of the most successful was Thomas Nast in New York City, who imported realistic German drawing techniques to major political issues in the era of the Civil War and Reconstruction. Nast was most famous for his 160 editorial cartoons attacking the criminal characteristics of Boss Tweed's political machine in New York City. American art historian Albert Boime argues that:

As a political cartoonist, Thomas Nast wielded more influence than any other artist of the 19th century. He not only enthralled a vast audience with boldness and wit, but swayed it time and again to his personal position on the strength of his visual imagination. Both Lincoln and Grant acknowledged his effectiveness in their behalf, and as a crusading civil reformer he helped destroy the corrupt Tweed Ring that swindled New York City of millions of dollars. Indeed, his impact on American public life was formidable enough to profoundly affect the outcome of every presidential election during the period 1864 to 1884.
Notable editorial cartoons include Benjamin Franklin's Join, or Die (1754), on the need for unity in the American colonies; The Thinkers Club (1819), a response to the surveillance and censorship of universities in Germany under the Carlsbad Decrees; and E. H. Shepard's The Goose-Step (1936), on the rearmament of Germany under Adolf Hitler. The Goose-Step is one of a number of notable cartoons first published in the British Punch magazine.


== Recognition ==
Institutions which archive and document editorial cartoons include the Center for the Study of Political Graphics in the United States, and the British Cartoon Archive in the United Kingdom.Editorial cartoons and editorial cartoonists are recognised by a number of awards, for example the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning (for US cartoonists, since 1922) and the British Press Awards' ""Cartoonist of the Year"".


== Modern political cartoons ==
Political cartoons can usually be found on the editorial page of many newspapers, although a few (such as Garry Trudeau's Doonesbury) are sometimes placed on the regular comic strip page. Most cartoonists use visual metaphors and caricatures to address complicated political situations, and thus sum up a current event with a humorous or emotional picture.Yaakov Kirschen, creator of the Israeli comic strip Dry Bones, says his cartoons are designed to make people laugh, which makes them drop their guard and see things the way he does. In an interview, he defined his objective as a cartoonist as an attempt to ""seduce rather than to offend.""Modern political cartooning can be built around traditional visual metaphors and symbols such as Uncle Sam, the Democratic donkey and the Republican elephant. One alternative approach is to emphasize the text or the story line, as seen in Doonesbury which tells a linear story in comic strip format.Cartoons have a great potential to political communication capable of enhancing political comprehension and reconceptualization of events, through specific frames of understanding. Mateus' analysis ""seems to indicate that the double standard thesis can be actually applied to trans-national contexts. This means that the framing of politics and business may not be limited to one country but may reflect a political world-view occurring in contemporary societies. From the double standard standpoint, there are no fundamental differences in the way Canadian political cartoonists and Portuguese political cartoons assess politics and business life"". The paper does not tell that all political cartoons are based on this kind of double standard, but suggests that the double standard thesis in Political Cartoons may be a frequent frame among possible others.A political cartoon commonly draws on two unrelated events and brings them together incongruously for humorous effect. The humour can reduce people's political anger and so serves a useful purpose. Such a cartoon also reflects real life and politics, where a deal is often done on unrelated proposals beyond public scrutiny.


== Pocket cartoons ==
A pocket cartoon is a form of cartoon which generally consists of a topical political gag/joke and appears as a single-panel single-column drawing. It was introduced by Osbert Lancaster in 1939 at the Daily Express. A 2005 obituary by The Guardian of its pocket cartoonist David Austin said ""Newspaper readers instinctively look to the pocket cartoon to reassure them that the disasters and afflictions besetting them each morning are not final. By taking a sideways look at the news and bringing out the absurd in it, the pocket cartoonist provides, if not exactly a silver lining, then at least a ray of hope.""


== Controversies related to cartoons ==
Editorial cartoons sometimes cause controversies. Examples include the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy and Charlie Hebdo shooting (stemming from the publication of cartoons related to Islam) and the 2007 Bangladesh cartoon controversy.Libel lawsuits have been rare. In Britain, the first successful lawsuit against a cartoonist in over a century came in 1921 when J.H. Thomas, the leader of the National Union of Railwaymen (NUR), initiated libel proceedings against the magazine of the British Communist Party. Thomas claimed defamation in the form of cartoons and words depicting the events of ""Black Friday""—when he allegedly betrayed the locked-out Miners' Federation. Thomas won his lawsuit, and restored his reputation.

On 18 July 2017, he was elected President of the Veneranda Fabbrica del Duomo in Milan.On 31 July 2018, for a corporate cut of commercial TV, he is no longer an employee of the same, but still retains the role of president.


== Judicial proceedings ==
In April 2008, Confalonieri was brought to trial by the Judge of the preliminary of Milan hearing on charges of tax fraud. The power of attorney contested Confalonieri with alleged crimes committed between 2001 and 2003. With regard to this proceeding, he was acquitted both in the first and second instance. On February 20, 2009 he was indicted for aiding and abetting as part of the investigation into the bankruptcy of Hdc, Luigi Crespi's polling company.
In January 2010, he was challenged for tax fraud in the Mediatrade-Rti investigation. On 18 October 2011, the Judge of the preliminary of Milan brought Pier Silvio Berlusconi and Fedele Confalonieri to trial and acquitted Silvio Berlusconi, considering the evidence against him insufficient.
On 22 May 2014, the prosecutor De Pasquale asked for 3 years and 2 months of imprisonment for Berlusconi Jr., 3 years and 4 months for Confalonieri, 3 years and 8 months for Frank Agrama (the alleged occult partner of his father in the sale of TV rights) and other sentences for some managers of the group.The following 8 July, Berlusconi Jr. and Confalonieri (together with Agrama) were prescribed for the events of 2005 and acquitted for those of 2006, 2007 and 2008 ""because the fact did not constitute a crime"". On 17 March 2016, the Court of Appeal of Milan overturned the first instance sentence, condemning Berlusconi and Confalonieri to a 1-year and 2-month prison sentence for 2007 events while they were prescribed for 2006 and acquitted for 2008 ""because the fact was no longer foreseen as a crime""; the prosecutors asked for 3 years and 2 months for the first and 3 years and 4 months for the second. The Court ordered the temporary disqualification from management offices and the prohibition on contracting with the public administration, as well as a compensation of 20,000 euros to the Revenue Agency as accessory penalties.
On 18 October 2016, the Court of Cassation quashed the postponement of one year and two months of imprisonment issued on appeal in the Mediatrade trial without delay.

Joseph Wolpe,"Joseph Wolpe (20 April 1915 in Johannesburg, South Africa – 4 December 1997 in Los Angeles) was a South African psychiatrist and one of the most influential figures in behavior therapy.
Wolpe grew up in South Africa, attending Parktown Boys' High School and obtaining his MD from the University of the Witwatersrand.
In 1956, Wolpe was awarded a Ford Fellowship and spent a year at Stanford University in the Center for Behavioral Sciences, subsequently returning to South Africa but permanently moving to the United States in 1960 when he accepted a position at the University of Virginia.
In 1965, Wolpe accepted a position at Temple University.One of the most influential experiences in Wolpe's life was when he enlisted in the South African army as a medical officer. Wolpe was entrusted to treat soldiers who were diagnosed with what was then called ""war neurosis"" but today is known as post traumatic stress disorder. The mainstream treatment of the time for soldiers was based on psychoanalytic theory, and involved exploring the trauma while taking a hypnotic agent – so-called narcotherapy. It was believed that having the soldiers talk about their repressed experiences openly would effectively cure their neurosis. However, this was not the case. It was this lack of successful treatment outcomes that forced Wolpe, once a dedicated follower of Freud, to question psychoanalytic therapy and search for more effective treatment options. Wolpe is most well known for his reciprocal inhibition techniques, particularly systematic desensitization, which revolutionized behavioral therapy. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Wolpe as the 53rd most cited psychologist of the 20th century, an impressive accomplishment accentuated by the fact that Wolpe was a psychiatrist.


== Reciprocal inhibition ==
In Wolpe's search for a more effective way in treating anxiety he developed different reciprocal inhibition techniques, utilizing assertiveness training. Reciprocal inhibition can be defined as anxiety being inhibited by a feeling or response that is not compatible with the feeling of anxiety. Wolpe first started using eating as a response to inhibited anxiety in the laboratory cats. He would offer them food while presenting a conditioned fear stimulus. After his experiments in the laboratory he applied reciprocal inhibition to his clients in the form of assertiveness training. The idea behind assertiveness training was that you could not be angry or aggressive while simultaneously assertive at same time. Importantly, Wolpe believed that these techniques would lessen the anxiety producing association. Assertiveness training proved especially useful for clients who had anxiety about social situations. However, assertiveness training did have a potential flaw in the sense that it could not be applied to other kinds of phobias. Wolpe's use of reciprocal inhibition led to his discovery of systematic desensitization. He believed that facing your fears did not always result in overcoming them but rather lead to frustration. According to Wolpe, the key to overcoming fears was ""by degrees"". This idea was not necessarily original to Wolpe as a similar concept was discussed in works of Abu Zayd al-Balkhi, who lived about 1000 years earlier.


== Systematic desensitization ==
Systematic desensitization is what Wolpe is most famous for. Systematic desensitization is when the client is exposed to the anxiety-producing stimulus at a low level, and once no anxiety is present a stronger version of the anxiety-producing stimulus is given. This continues until the individual client no longer feels any anxiety towards the stimulus. There are three main steps in using systematic desensitization, following development of a proper case formulation or what Wolpe originally called, ""behavior analysis"". The first step is to teach the client relaxation techniques.Wolpe received the idea of relaxation from Edmund Jacobson, modifying his muscle relaxation techniques to take less time. Wolpe's rationale was that one cannot be both relaxed and anxious at the same time. The second step is for the client and the therapist to create a hierarchy of anxieties. The therapist normally has the client make a list of all the things that produce anxiety in all its different forms. Then together, with the therapist, the client makes a hierarchy, starting with what produces the lowest level of anxiety to what produces the most anxiety. Next is to have the client be fully relaxed while imaging the anxiety producing stimulus. Depending on what their reaction is, whether they feel no anxiety or a great amount of anxiety, the stimulus will then be changed to a stronger or weaker one. Systematic desensitization, though successful, has flaws as well. The patient may give misleading hierarchies, have trouble relaxing, or not be able to adequately imagine the scenarios. Despite this possible flaw, it seems to be most successful.


== Achievements ==
Wolpe's effect on behavioral therapy is long-lasting and extensive. He received many awards for his work in behavioral science. His awards included the American Psychological Associations Distinguished Scientific Award, the Psi Chi Distinguished Member Award, and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Association for the Advancement of Behavior Therapy, where he was the second president. In addition to these awards, Wolpe's alma mater, University of Witwatersrand, awarded him an honorary doctor of science degree in 1986. Furthermore, Wolpe was a prolific writer, some of his most famous books include, The Practice of Behavior Therapy and Psychotherapy by Reciprocal Inhibition. Joseph Wolpe's dedication to psychology is clear in his involvement in the psychology community, a month before his death he was attending conferences and giving lectures at Pepperdine University even though he was retired. Moreover, his theories have lasted well beyond his death.
Wolpe developed the Subjective Units of Disturbance Scale (SUDS) for assessing the level of subjective discomfort or psychological pain. He also created the Subjective Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Fear Survey Plan that are used in behavior research and therapy.Wolpe died in 1997 of mesothelioma.

ADM Jabalpur v. Shivkant Shukla,"ADM Jabalpur v. Shivkant Shukla was a landmark judgement of the Supreme Court of India pertaining to the suspension of Articles 21 and 226 of the Indian Constitution in the event of a National Emergency. This controversial judgment of P.N. Bhagwati, decreed during the emergency from 25 June 1975 to 21 March 1977, held that a person's right to not be unlawfully detained (i.e. habeas corpus) can be suspended in the interest of the State. This judgment received a lot of criticism since it reduced the importance attached to Fundamental Rights under the Indian Constitution. Going against the previous decisions of High Courts, the bench which included P. N. Bhagwati concluded by a majority 4:1 in favour of the then Indira Gandhi government while only Justice Hans Raj Khanna was opposed to it. Bhagwati openly praised Indira Gandhi during the Emergency period, later criticized her when Janata Party-led government was formed and again backed Gandhi when she got re-elected to form government in 1980. Bhagwati was criticized for these change of stands, favouring the ruling government, which were deemed as to have been taken to better his career prospects. Bhagwati later in 2011 agreed with popular opinion that this judgement was short-sighted and apologised.


== Dissent ==
Justice Hans Raj Khanna was the sole dissenter among the five judges. In retaliation for his dissent, he was later overlooked during the appointment of the Chief Justice.


== Reception ==
According to Ajay Kumar of Firstpost, ""the judgment has been viewed as a stain on the legacy of the court for many years. The ratio decidendi (rationale behind the judgment) that all rights under our Constitution are a positive creation of law rather than merely recognised greatly increases the power of the State to do what it likes with them.""


== Overruled ==
The ADM Jabalpur case was overruled on the doctrinal grounds concerning the rights by the Puttaswamy v. Union of India delivered by a nine judge, constitutional bench of the Supreme court. At the paragraph 119 of the majority opinion the Court had ruled:

Cinema of Canada,"Cinema in Canada dates back to the earliest known display of film in Saint-Laurent, Quebec, in 1896. The film industry in Canada has been dominated by the United States, which has utilized Canada as a shooting location and to bypass British film quota laws, throughout its history. Canadian filmmakers, English and French, have been active in the development of cinema in the United States.
Films by Thomas A. Edison, Inc. were some of the first to arrive in Canada and early films made in the country were produced by Edison Studios. Canadian Pacific Railway and other railways supported early filmmaking including James Freer, whose Ten Years in Manitoba was the first known film by a Canadian. Evangeline is the earliest recorded Canadian feature film. George Brownridge and Ernest Shipman were major figures in Canadian cinema in the 1920s and 1930s. Shipman oversaw the production the most expensive film up to that point. Brownridge's career led to Carry on, Sergeant! and its failure caused a decline in the film industry.
The Canadian Government Motion Picture Bureau was formed in 1918, and expanded to sound and 16 mm film in the 1930s before merging into the National Film Board of Canada. The NFB expanded under the leadership of John Grierson. The Canadian Cooperation Project between the government and Motion Picture Association of America from 1948 to 1958, negatively effected Canadian filmmaking. Internal divisions between English and French Canadians within the NFB starting in the 1940s led to the creation of an independent branch for French language productions by the 1960s. The government provided financial support to the film industry through the Capital Cost Allowance and Telefilm Canada.


== History ==


=== Film ===


==== Arrival of film ====

The first time a film was displayed in Canada, and one of the first times in North America, was at an event organized by Louis Minier and Louis Pupier using a cinematograph in Saint-Laurent, Quebec, on 27 June 1896. Prior to the discovery of the Saint-Laurent showing by Germain Lacasse in 1984, it was believed that a showing conducted by Andrew M. Holland and George C. Holland, where films by Thomas A. Edison, Inc. such as The Kiss were shown, in Ottawa, from 21 July to 28 August 1896, was the first. The Saint-Laurent showing was overlooked as English researchers did not search through French sources. Léo-Ernest Ouimet stated that he attended the showing and he was used as evidence of it until Lacasse found newspaper coverage of the event in La Presse. R.A. Hardie and F.H. Wall also presented films in Winnipeg from 18 to 25 July 1896.The development of a Canadian film industry was hampered by the country's low population density, it had six million inhabitants and only Toronto and Montreal had more than 100,000 people in 1905, and the lack of domestic vaudeville as most of the acts came from the United States, United Kingdom, and France. Andrew Holland was critical of Canada as a place for the film industry due to the quality of its films, distance between major urban areas, and different electrical systems. Early films were used to as promotional material for companies, promote immigration, or displays of scenic locations including Niagara Falls. The Edison Company created some of the first films in Canada by documenting the Klondike Gold Rush, Canadian soldiers leaving to fight in the Second Boer War, and George V, the Duke of York, arriving in Canada in 1902.
James Freer is believed to have been the first Canadian to produce films. He purchased an Edison camera and projector and started filming agriculture activates and Canadian Pacific Railway trains in 1897, and toured the United Kingdom with the sponsorship of the CPR in 1898, and a second less successful tour was sponsored by Clifford Sifton in 1901. His second tour was the first time that the government was directly involved with film. British and American filmmakers were selected as they could guarantee the distribution of their films unlike Canadian filmmakers. The CPR enlisted Charles Urban and his company, in order to allow the distribution of the films to the United Kingdom, to travel and film Canada to promote settlement in the western areas. This group, the Bioscope Company of Canada, conducted filming in Quebec to Victoria from 1902 to 1903. The film, Living Canada, was premiered at the Palace Theatre in 1903, with High Commissioner Donald Smith in attendance. A total of thirty-five Living Canada films were released by 1904, and was reedited into Wonders of Canada in 1906. Urban success led to him gaining contracts with the government of British Columbia and the Northern Railway Company. The Grand Trunk Railway entered the industry by hiring Butcher's Film Service in 1909. The CPR hired the Edison Company to film in Canada and they sent nine people, including J. Searle Dawley, Henry Cronjager, and Mabel Trunnelle, in 1910. They were provided a specialized train and the RMS Empress of India and produced thirteen films.


==== Creating an independent film industry ====
Silent films used intertitles in English and French, but sound films were mostly produced in English. The first recorded feature film created in Canada was Evangeline. The Palace was the first theatre to transition to showing sound films when it presented Street Angel on 1 September 1928. There were multiple attempts to create an independent film industry in Canada in the early 20th century. Thirty-six companies meant for film production were created between 1914 and 1922, but the majority of the companies did not produce any films.
In 1914, Canadian Animated Weekly by Universal Pictures became one of the first newsreels in Canada. Ouimet, who was a pioneer for Canadian newsreels, created Specialty Film Import in 1915, as a distributor, but his newsreel and distribution companies were sold in 1923, and he unsuccessfully worked in the United States in the 1920s. At the peak of Ouimet's career 1.5 million Canadians were watching his newsreels twice per week. Domestic newsreel companies were unsuccessful after branches of American companies, Fox Canadian News and Canadian Kinograms, were established.Ernest Shipman established multiple film companies in cities and would produce a limited amount of films using local money before moving to another area. Unlike other Canadian filmmakers he sought financial support from the American market. In 1919, incorporated Canadian Photoplays with a financial capital of $250,000 in Alberta. He started production on Wapi, the Walrus, but retitled it to Back to God's Country to capitalize God's Country and the Woman, starring his wife Nell Shipman. The film was a critical and financial success, with it grossing over $500,000 in its first year, and Shipman's investors saw a 300% return on investment. Despite the success of the film Canadian Photoplays did not produce another film and went into voluntary liquidation. He signed a contract with Ralph Connor in 1919, and formed Dominion Films, based in New York, to produce films in Winnipeg. Winnipeg Productions was formed to adapt twelve of Connor's stories, but only five were filmed. Shipman created five companies across Canada in 1922, but only three produced films. He incorporated New Brunswick Films on 23 August 1922, but the failure of Blue Water ended Shipman's career.Trenton, Ontario, despite its small size, was a major film production area and had one of the few studios to last longer than a few years. Canadian National Features, founded by George Brownridge, construction a studio in the town and raised a financial capital of $500,000, with $278,000 coming within the first week, in 1916. However, the company suspended production after spending $43,000 on its first two films, The Marriage Trap and Power, and declared bankruptcy with $79,000 in assets. The studio in Trenton was taken over by the Pan American Film Corporation in 1918, but only released one film before closing. Brownridge founded Adanac Producing Company and released the two Canadian National Features films in 1918. Brownridge shifted production towards corporate sponsorships by displaying products in dramatized films. Brownridge sought a sponsorship from the CPR and John Murray Gibbon saw Power and asked Brownridge to make anti-Bolshevik films during the First Red Scare. Adanac was reorganized in 1919, with Brownridge as its managing director and Denis Tansey, a member of parliament, as its president. The Great Shadow was released in 1920, after being filmed in Canada rather than New York as Brownridge wanted to create a domestic film industry, and was a critical and financial success although the CPR pulled its public support before its release. However, the company went bankrupt with Brownridge balming Harley Knoles's wastefulness and Selznick Pictures's distribution policy. Brownridge sold the Trenton studio to the Ontario Motion Picture Bureau in 1924, and it continued to be used, with Carry on, Sergeant! as the sole fictional work filmed there, until Mitchell Hepburn ordered its closure in 1934, and it was turned into a community centre.Motion Skreenadz, incorporated in 1920, conducted the majority of film production in western Canada and brought colour film production to British Columbia. Leon C. Shelly gained control over Motion Skreenadz and Vancouver Motion Pictures from 1936 to 1937. He extended the company to Toronto in 1945, but relocated the company entirely to Toronto in 1946. The company was reorganized into Shelly Films, but production of non-newsreels was ended in favor of focusing on film laboratories.British Columbia's government agencies used promotional films from 1908 to 1919, before the creation of the British Columbia Patriotic and Educational Picture Service. It was headed by A. R. Baker and mainly distributed films produced under contract by Arthur D. Kean. The provincial legislature passed legislation requiring the display of at least one ten-minute education film or travelogue during all of the programs. The Motion Picture Branch of the Bureau of Publications was created by Saskatchewan in 1924, to produce education films.The Ontario Motion Picture Bureau was established in 1917, but did not produce its own films until 1923. S.C. Johnson, who worked in the Ontario Agriculture Department, was its first director. The victory of the United Farmers of Ontario in the 1919 election resulted in Peter Smith reorganized film production under the Amusement Branch with Otter Elliott heading it. He changed the focus of filmmaking from agricultural training towards quality productions. By 1925, the bureau had 2,000 films in its library, distributed 1,500 reels of film per month, and made one feature-length documentary, Cinderella of the Farms in 1931, but the bureau was dissolved after the Ontario Liberal Party won in the 1934 Ontario general election.Albert Tessier and Maurice Proulx produced large amounts of films in French at a time when it was uncommon. Joseph Morin, the Quebec Minister of Agriculture, used film for education purposes and the Service de ciné-photographie was established in 1941.The War Office Cinematographic Committee, one of the first times the national government was involved in filmmaking, was formed in 1916, and was led by Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook. The committee contracted the Topical Film Company before buying a controlling share. The committee aided in the production of distribution of D. W. Griffith's Hearts of the World. The committee was dissolved after World War I and its shares in Topical Film Company were sold, which were donated to war charities.The Associated Screen News of Canada was founded by Bernard Norrish in 1920, and the CPR held a majority control of its stock. The company grew from two employees in 1920, to over one hundred by 1930, and focused on the production of newsreels, theatrical shorts, and sponsored films. It was the largest Canadian film company until the growth of Crawley Films in the 1950s. It was one of Canada's longest lasting film production companies with Crawley Films and the National Film Board of Canada being one of the few to outlast it. Before ASN constructed a film laboratory all of the film print distributed in Canada were processed in the United States. The company was processing twenty-two million feet of film in per year by 1929. ASN constructed a sound stage in 1936, and produced House in Order, which was its only feature film in the 1930s.
Brownridge was sent to New York in 1925 by the Ontario Motion Picture Bureau to gain a distribution contract, but only negotiated one with Cranfield and Clarke after a year of high expenses. Treasurer William Herbert Price criticized Brownridge stating that his ""travelling expenses are very high and I do not see there was very much result from anything he has done"". George Patton, the bureau's head, supported the deal as Cranfield and Clarke had no Jews in its company. W.F. Clarke, who was later blamed for the company's financial failure, pushed for Canadian film production and came up with an idea of a film about ""a dramatic story written by an eminent authority around the part played by the Canadians in the World War"". Clarke incorporated British Empire Films of Canada in June 1927. The film adaption of The Better 'Ole was released in Canada under the name Carry On! and was financially success. Clarke's film was named Carry on, Sergeant! to help raise funds. It received financial backing from influential people, including prime ministers Arthur Meighen and Bennett. The film started production, by the recently created subsidiary Canadian International Films, in 1926, and Bruce Bairnsfather was hired to direct with an expensive contract, but his inexperience with film led to production troubles that increased the cost of the budget. The production difficulties led to internal company problems and Clarke was removed as general manager although he remained vice-president.The film was released in 1928, to mixed-to-negative reviews and was only distributed in Ontario before the company went bankrupt in 1929. Brownridge attempted to recut and release the film in 1930, stating that it ""would gross at least $200,000"", but it did not happen. The Ontario government was still interested in attempting to create a large film studio by 1932, along with Edward Wentworth Beatty and Herbert Samuel Holt, but the recent failure of Canadian International Films and Great Depression led to its not receiving investments. The Canadian film industry would not recover until after World War II.


==== National Film Board ====

The Exhibits and Publicity Bureau was founded on 19 September 1918, and was reorganized into the Canadian Government Motion Picture Bureau on 1 April 1923. Its films were theatrically released in the United States by Bray Productions. The organization's budget stagnated and declined during the Great Depression. The organization was led by Bernard Norrish from 1917 to 1920, Raymond Peck from 1920 to 1927, and Frank Badgley from 1927 to 1941. Badgley stated that the bureau needed to transition to sound films or else it would lose its access to theatrical releases, but the organization did not gain the equipment until 1934, and by then it had lost its theatrical distributors. Badgley was able to get a 16 mm film facility for the bureau in 1931. The organization's budget fell from $75,000 in 1930, to $65,000 in 1931, and $45,000 in 1932. However, its budget was increased to $70,000 in 1933. The bureau was reorganized into the National Film Board of Canada in 1941, following John Grierson's recommendation.
Ross McLean was working as the secretary to High Commissioner Vincent Massey when he met Grierson, and asked for Grierson to come to Canada to aide in the governmental film policy. Grierson made a report on the Canadian film industry in 1938, and the National Film Act, which he drafted, was passed in 1939 causing the creation of the NFB. Grierson became the first Film Commissioner of the NFB and served until the end of World War II. Employment rose from fifty to over seven hundred from 1941 to 1945, although it was cut by 40% after the war ended. Grierson selected McLean to work as assistant commissioner and Stuart Legg to oversee the productions.Lest We Forget, Canada's first feature-length war documentary with sound, was released in 1935. Grierson made efforts to increase the theatrical distribution of NFB films, primarily its war-related films, as he was coordinating wartime information for the United Kingdom in North America. Famous Players aided in distribution and the Canadian Motion Picture War Services Committee, which worked with the War Activities Committee of the Motion Pictures Industry, was founded in 1940. NFB productions such as The World in Action was watched by 30-40 million people per month in the United Kingdom and United States in 1943, and Canada Carries On was watched by 2.25 million people by 1944. The audience for NFB newsreels reached 40-50 million per week by 1944.Grierson opposed feature film production as he believed that Canada did not have a large enough market for an independent feature film industry. He supported working with American film companies and stated that ""the theatre film business is an international business, dependent when it comes to distribution on an alliance or understanding with American film interests"". He travelled to Hollywood in 1944, and the NFB sent scripts to American companies for consideration.Grierson lacked strong support in the Canadian government and some of his films received opposition from members of the government. Inside Fighting Russia was criticized for its support of the Russian Revolution and Balkan Powderkeg for criticizing the United Kingdom's policy in the Balkans. Grierson and the NFB were attacked during the onset of the Cold War. The Federal Bureau of Investigation created a file on Grierson in 1942, due to the World in Action newsreel being considered too left-wing. Leo Dolan, an ally of Hepburn and the head of the Canadian Government Travel Bureau, accused Grierson of being Jewish and a Co-operative Commonwealth Federation supporter. The Gouzenko Affair implicated Freda Linton, one of Grierson's secretaries, and the organization was criticized by the Progressive Conservative Party for subversive tendencies, financial waste, and being a monopoly. Grierson was also accused of being involved, but was proven not to be although he resigned as commissioner in 1945.McLean was ordered to assist the Royal Canadian Mounted Police screen NFB employees and the RCMP requested him to fire a list of employees. McLean, who refused to fire any employees without their disloyalty being proven, was not reappointed as commissioner and replaced by William Arthur Irwin in 1950. Irwin also refused to fire employees without proven disloyalty and reduced the demand and only three of the thirty-six requested were fired.The Royal Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters and Sciences, with Massey as its chair, was formed in 1949. The NFB submitted a brief asking to have a headquarters constructed, budget increases, and to become a Crown corporation. Robert Winters, whose ministry oversaw the NFB, stated that its brief did not represent government policy. The Association of Motion Picture Producers and Laboratories of Canada submitted a brief criticizing a government monopoly, with the NFB's crown corporation request being referred to as an ""expansionist, monopolistic psychology"", and that they were unable to compete with the NFB as it paid no taxes and was exempt from tariffs. The commission's report supported the NFB and its requests for Crown corporation status and a headquarters were accepted.
A Canadian tour by Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip was filmed and was initially meant to be two reels, worth twenty minutes, but grew to five reels as they could not determine what to cut. Irwin met with Harvey Harnick, the NFB's Columbia theatrical distributor, and J.J. Fitzgibbons, the president of Famous Players, and Fitzgibbons told Irwin that he would screen all five reels if the film was completed for a Christmas release. Royal Journey opened in seventeen first-run theatres and over course of the next two years it was screened in 1,249 Canadian theatres where it was watched by a record two million people and the film was also screened in forty other countries. The film cost $88,000, but the NFB gained a profit of $150,000 and the film's success was one of the reasons Grierson stated that Irwin ""saved the Film Board"".The Canadian Government Motion Picture Bureau and Associated Screen News of Canada had no French-Canadian employees. Vincent Paquette became the NFB's first French-Canadian filmmaker in 1941, and directed La Cité de Notre-Dame, the board's first in-house French-language film, in 1942. The number of French-Canadian employees grew to seventeen by 1945, and a quarter of the board's budget was spent on French productions. The Massey Commission and Gratien Gélinas, a member of the NFB's Board of Governors, called for an improvement in French-language productions, but Premier Maurice Duplessis opposed it.French-language media, including Le Devoir, criticized the NFB after it removed Roger Blais in 1957. NFB francophone directors Denys Arcand, Gilles Carle, Jacques Godbout, Gilles Groulx, and Clément Perron criticized the organization for its censorship policies, refusal to produce feature films, and its colonial treatment of Quebec. Michel Brault, Carle, Bernard Gosselin, Groulx, and Arthur Lamothe left following reprimands. Guy Roberge became the first French-Canadian to serve as the NFB's commissioner. Duplessis died in 1959, and Quebec Liberal Party gained control while the Liberal Party won in the 1963 Canadian federal election. The Liberals supported a policy of bilingualism and biculturalism. A French-language branch of the NFB that was independent of its English-language productions was formed in 1964, under the leadership of Pierre Juneau.Drylanders, the organization's first English language feature-length fiction film, was released in 1963.Kathleen Shannon organized Studio D, the first publicly funded feminist film-production unit in the world, in 1974, and produced 125 films before its closure in 1996. However, there would be no French version of Studio D until the formation of Studio B in 1986.


==== Governmental financial involvement ====
Starting in 1954, the Capital Cost Allowance was able to be used for a 60% tax write-off for film investment and the amount was increased to 100% in 1974. $1.2 billion was invested in Canadian film and television in the thirteen years following the increase. The average film budget rose from $527,000 to $2.6 million in 1979, and $3.5 million in 1986. From 1958 to 1967, private film investment accounted for 18% of film investments and it declined to 13.5% in 1968, while the CFDC accounted for 37.5%. Following the tax write-off increase private investment rose to account for 47% of film investment between 1975 and 1978 while the CFDC declined to 15%. Silence of the North was the first film with American backing to receive CCA certification. The Film and Video Production Tax Credit replaced the Capital Cost Allowance in 1995.In 1962, Roberge proposed the creation of an organization to aid in film finance based on the National Film Finance Corporation and Centre national du cinéma et de l'image animée.
The Interdepartmental Committee on the Possible Development of a Feature Film Industry in Canada, under the leadership of NFB commissioner Roberge, was formed by the secretary of state. The committee submitted a report to the 19th Canadian Ministry for the creation of a loan fund to aid the development of the Canadian film industry. The proposal was approved in October 1965, and legislation, the Canadian Film Development Corporation Act of 1966-67, for its creation was introduced in June 1966, before being approved on 3 March 1967. The Canadian Film Development Corporation was established with a budget of $10 million in 1967. In February 1968, Spender was appointed as its director along with a five-member board. Canada lack of a film school leading to the creation of the Canadian Film Centre by Norman Jewison. The CFDC started investing up to 50% of its budget into films that cost less than $500,000.Explosion was the first film to receive financial support from the CFDC. Valérie by Denis Héroux, which was not financially supported by the CFDC, was made at cost of $70,000 and made over $1 million in Quebec. The CFDC financially supported Héroux's other films Here and Now (L'Initiation), Love in a Four Letter World, Virgin Lovers, and Two Women in Gold (Deux Femmes en or). Deux Femmes en or was financially successful, with its two million ticket sales remaining the highest in Canadian history, and became the highest grossing Canadian film.The $10 million budget was used by October 1971, after the CFDC invested $6.7 million into 64 films with an average cost of $250,000 per film. The CFDC was not financially successful as only three of those films made a profit and the organization recovered $600,000 of its investments. After 1970 the CFDC focused on investing in smaller budgeted films and ended its work with American theatrical distributors to them hiding profits. Another $10 million budget was given to the CFDC in November 1971, and a new investment strategy in which $600,000 per year would be invested into productions, with its creative and technical crew being Canadian, budgeted below $100,000, and $3 million per year on films with guaranteed distribution. It took the CFDC five years to recover its first $1 million investment, but recovered $1 million in 1977 alone. From 1977 to 1978, the CFDC invested $1.6 million into twenty films and its investments rose to $10.8 million into 34 films from 1979 to 1980. Between 1968 and 1978, the organization funded 103 English-language films, but only Black Christmas, Death Weekend, Heart Farm, Shivers, and The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz were profitable to the CFDC.The Toronto Filmmakers' Coop, an organization with 150 filmmakers, sent a letter with the endorsement of 200 filmmakers to Gérard Pelletier asking for the creation of a content quota that required distributors to have 15% of their films be Canadian. Pelletier announced the creation of a theatre in the National Capital Region that exclusively showed Canadian films in 1972. A study published by the Secretary of State reported that a content quota would not work as a 50% quote would generate less revenue than a 5% sales increase for foreign films. The study stated that new tax regulations and investments by the CFDC could make the Canadian film industry internationally competitive.The budget for the CFDC was limited to a few million and its budget from 1982 to 1983 was $4.5 million. However, the organization had its role expanded to include television in 1983, and administered the Canadian Broadcast Program Development Fund. The television fund was initially given an annual budget of $60 million. An annual budget of $30 million through the Feature Film Fund was created in 1986, and an annual budget of $17 million through the Feature Film Distribution Fund was created in 1988. The organization's combined budget grew to $146 million by 1989.A report was written by a task force in 1985, and it stated that foreign domination of film and video distribution, chronic undercapitalization of production companies, and concentration of theatre ownership and distribution and exhibition vertical integration hurt the development of the film industry. They recommended legislation to increase the control of Canadian-owned companies over distribution and Minister of Communications Flora MacDonald proposed a film licensing system based on their recommendations. American distributors opposed the policy and lobbied the American government through the MPAA and its president, Jack Valenti. Valenti met with President Ronald Reagan at least twice and Reagan criticized the legislation of a US-Canadian economic summit. 54 members of the United States Congress signed a letter to Prime Minister Brian Mulroney opposing the legislation. The legislation was not tabled and it failed.


==== Post-Carry on, Sergeant! ====
F. R. Crawley, who was involved in filmmaking for a decade, and Judith Crawley created Île d'Orléans in 1938, and its success led to a $3,000 loan from F. R. Crawley's father that created Crawley Films. It employment rose from 6 in 1946, 33 in 1949, and around 100 by the 1950s. One-sixth of the $3 million worth of films produced by the Canadian film industry in 1952 came from Crawley Films.France Film and other companies started creating French film productions in the 1930s. Maria Chapdelaine is commonly, although incorrectly, regarded as the first French-Canadian sound movie. Étienne Brûlé gibier de potence was the first colour feature film made in Quebec and the first Canadian colour film shot in English and French. Joseph-Alexandre DeSève monopolized the distribution of French-language films through France-Film. France-Film arose from the distribution of Maria Chapdelaine which sold 70,000 tickets in Canada. He also aided in the production of Notre-Dame de la Mouise in response to the papal encyclical Vigilanti Cura. DeSève purchased Renaissance Films following the success of The Music Master. DeSève produced four films through Renaissance Films Distribution. Paul L'Anglais formed Quebec Productions filmed Whispering City in English and French, under the title La Forteresse. It was seen by over 100,000 people in Quebec over the course of six weeks.The papal encyclical Vigilanti Cura in 1936, changed the Catholic attitude towards movies and the church became a part of Quebec movie production in the 1940s. Most of the nineteen movies, fifteen in French and four in English, produced in Quebec from 1944 to 1953 were made by Renaissance Films or Quebec Productions. Those were the only French-language feature films produced in Canada in that period.Bush Pilot was the only English-language feature film created by a Canadian company in the 1940s.


==== Modern industry ====
Canadians had to import colour 35 mm film until 1967, as Canada did not produce any internally.By the 1960s Nat Taylor, a theatre owner, controlled the largest private film studio in Canada, Toronto International Film Studios, two distribution companies, International Film Distributors and Allied Artists Pictures, a television station, CJOH-DT, and multiple production companies. He entered film production with The Mask in 1961. Taylor, unlike other members of the AMPPLC, supported state involvement in feature film production.Bryant Fryer founded one of the first animation companies in Canada and made six silhouette films from 1927 to 1935. Norman McLaren was brought to Canada from Scotland by Grierson in 1941. McLaren recruited English-Canadian animators from OCAD University, including George Dunning, Evelyn Lambart, Grant Munro, and Robert Verrall. McLaren recruited French-Canadian animators from École des beaux-arts de Montréal, including René Jodoin. Jodoin created a French animation unit in 1966, which included Laurent Coderre and Bernard Longpré. Le village enchanté was the first recorded animated feature film in Canadian history and Return to Oz which was based on Tales of the Wizard of Oz, the first recorded Canadian animated television series, was the second recorded animated feature film.In the 1960s filmmakers came from universities throughout Canada. David Cronenberg, Clarke Mackey, and David Secter graduated from the University of Toronto. John Hofsess, Ivan Reitman, and Peter Rowe graduated from McMaster University. Jack Darcus and Larry Kent graduated from the University of British Columbia. Cronenberg received financial support from the CFDC and Shivers was their most successful investment, with a budget of $150,000 ($75,000 from the CFDC) and gross of $5 million. 708 feature films, over twice the amount made in the past fifty years, were made during the 1970s.Carle, Groulx, Claude Jutra, and Jean Pierre Lefebvre, who were inspired by the French New Wave, made their directorial debuts from 1963 to 1965, and all won the Grand Prix at the Montreal International Film Festival throughout the 1960s. Jean-Claude Lauzon's Night Zoo won the most Genie Awards in history, with thirteen awards.Dream Life by Mireille Dansereau was the first privately produced feature film in Canada to be directed by a woman.Porky's became the first Canadian film to gross more than $100 million. The Decline of the American Empire was the most successful Quebec film released in France with 1,236,322 viewers. The Care Bears Movie, by Nelvana, was the highest-grossing non-Disney animated film at the time of its release. Six of the ten highest-grossing films in Canada between 1991 and 2001 were made in Quebec.Film investment in British Columbia rose from $188.5 million in 1990 to over $1 billion in 1999. Feature film production rose from 16 films to 56 films with the total amount of productions rising from 50 to 192.


=== Theatres ===
In the 1890s and 1900s films were shown by travelling showmen. John C. Green, a magician who presented for the Holland brothers at their first showing, travelled throughout eastern Canada and New England until the establishment of movie theatres. John Albert Schuberg was credited with bringing movies to Vancouver and Winnipeg, and the provinces of British Columbia and the Canadian Prairies. Schuberg established Canada's first permanent movie theatre, the Electric Theatre, in Vancouver, in October 1902, with its first movie played being The Eruption of Mount Pelee. He opened additional theatres in Winnipeg, and later gained the license for First National Pictures in western Canada. He had one of the largest theatre chains and sold it to Jay and Jules Allen for around $1 million in 1919, before returning in 1921, and then selling it to Famous Players in 1924.Jay and Jules Allen established their first theatre in Brantford in 1906. The established Allen Amusement Corporation, a film exchange, in 1908. Their chain was worth over $20 million by 1920, and had fifty-three theatres by 1923, when they declared bankruptcy and it was acquired by Famous Players. The Allens owned the distribution rights for Pathé and Paramount Pictures. In 1916, they rejected an offer by Paramount president Adolph Zukor to create an equal partnership. The Allens informed Nathan Nathanson of this attempt and Nathanson convinced Zukor to give him their distribution rights in 1920, for twenty years after creating his own theatre chain.
Nathanson's Famous Players started an expansion campaign in the 1920s that led to its gaining control of all first run theatres in the major cities. Zukor and Paramount forced Nathanson out of Famous Players after buying a large amount of the stock in 1930. Famous Players also controlled the distribution industry in Canada, accounting for at least 40% of distribution, due to its connections to Paramount Pictures. Paul Nathanson managed Regal Films, which was controlled by Paramount, and distributed films from British International Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and Pathé, and Famous Players also distributed films from Columbia Pictures. Fox Film, RKO Pictures, Tiffany Pictures, and Warner Bros. were the other main distributors in Canada in the 1930s. A study conducted by United Artists in 1931 showed that 67% of rental revenue in Canada came from nineteen theatres in Canada's main cities while the remainder came from the rest.Block booking by major studios, that were from outside Canada, prevented independent theatre owners from obtaining films at a reasonable price. R. B. Bennett, who invested into the film industry, made investigating the film industry an issue in the 1930 election. Peter White was appointed to investigate Famous Players' monopolistic control of theatres under the Combines Investigation Act. White concluded that ""a combine exists and has existed at least since the year of 1926"" and Famous Players was detrimental to the public interest in 1931, but no action was taken against the company. Bennett supported taking action and the attorney generals of Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, and Saskatchewan would prosecute Famous Players. Fifteen companies and three people, including Nathan Nathanson, were charged, but the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in favor of the companies.After losing control over Famous Players Nathanson created Odeon Theatres in April 1941, and resigned from his position at Famous Players in May. He built the company using Regal Films, which was managed by his brother and distributed MGM films, and gaining the business of companies whose contracts with Famous Players were expiring. Odeon did not gain a MGM distribution contract, but did gain ones for all of Columbia Pictures' films, two-thirds of Universal's films, and one-third of Fox's films. Nathanson died in 1943, and was succeeded by his son Paul. Films released in Famous Players and Odeon theatres, both foreign owned after Paul sold his stock to J. Arthur Rank in 1946, accounted for over 60% of the Canadian box office by 1947. Taylor, who declined to become the general manager of Odeon in 1941, founded Twentieth Century Theatres in the 1930s and the Famous Players-aligned company grew to own sixty-five theatres by the 1960s. He opened the International Theatre in Toronto which was the first theatre in Canada dedicated towards screening art films. Taylor and Garth Drabinsky created the Cineplex Odeon Corporation in 1979, and by 1987 it was the largest theatre chain in North America with 1,500 theatres, with two-thirds of them in the United States.The deaths of seventy-eight children from the Laurier Palace Theatre fire in 1927, and opposition to film from the Catholic Church led to a ban on minors attending movie theatres until 1961. In the 1930s Quebec was the only province that allowed for theatres to be open on Sundays. The Quebec Cinema Act, passed in 1983, required that English-language films in Quebec must be translated into French within sixty days. However, films from the United States were unaffected as their distribution ended before the deadline and the NFB was exempted from the requirements.The Canadian box office increased following World War II. In 1934, there were 796 theatres which admitted 107 million people to earn $25 million and that grew to 1,229 theatres admitting 151 million people to make $37 million in 1940. By 1950, the amount of theatres increased to 2,360 earning $86 million with 245 million people attending. However, during the 1950s Canadian film attendance declined with the nation falling from the fifth-highest in film attendance to twenty-fifth by the 1960s and the amount of films the average Canadian saw per year dropped from seventeen in 1950 to eight in 1960. Ticket sales in Quebec fell from 60 million in 1952, to 19 million in 1969. The amount of theatres in Canada declined from 1,635 in 1962, to 1,400 in 1967, to 1,116 in 1974, and to 899 in 1984. 


=== International ===

Many native-born Canadians, such as Al Christie, Allan Dwan, Louis B. Mayer, Sidney Olcott, Mack Sennett, and Jack L. Warner, aided in the creation and development of the American film industry.In the early 1900s Canada was used as a shooting location for dramatic productions with Hiawatha, the Messiah of the Ojibway being one of the first in 1903. The Kalem Company was one of the first American companies to conduct location shooting in Canada in 1909. Two of the films D. W. Griffith made in his first year as a director, The Ingrate and A Woman's Way, were made in Canada. British American Film Company, Canadian Bioscope Company, Conness Till Film Company of Toronto, and the All-Red Feature Company, the four Canadians companies that produced fictional films prior to World War I, had their invested come from Americans, but all of them were financially unsuccessful and closed within a few years with Conness Till suffering a fire that destroyed their $50,000 studio.Canadians were hostile to American filmmakers and provincial film review boards instituted censorship policies in 1915, which included a ban on the gratuitous display of the flag of the United States. Fifty reels of film were banned in British Columbia in 1914, due to ""an unnecessary display of U.S. flags"" which put it as the third most common reason behind infidelity and seduction. In 1927, the United Kingdom created a quota limiting the amount of foreign films that could be shown in the country, but productions that were produced within the British Empire and was mostly made by British subjects were excluded from the quotas. American financers produced low-budget B movies within Canada to exploit the loophole before the legislation was changed in 1938 to exclude the Dominion. Nanook of the North and The Viking exploited the loophole. From 1928 to 1938, twenty-two feature films, the majority of Canada's film production, meant solely for the British market were filmed.American companies made $17 million in profits from Canada in 1947. Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King's government sought to reduce the general trade imbalance between Canada and the United States. McLean called for the reinvestment of this money into Canadian film production and requiring the American distribution of Canadian shorts. The Motion Picture Association of America proposed the Canadian Cooperation Project and it was accepted by the Canadian government on 14 January 1948. The government would not restrict revenue to American companies in exchange for productions being filmed in Canada and mentions of Canada in those scripts to promote tourism. The project was considered unsuccessful and stifled Canadian filmmaking, with only eight Canadian feature films being made during the CCP's existence, before it ended in 1958. McLean was critical of the agreement as there was a lack of Canadian films distributed in the United States. Michael Spencer stated that the agreement was ""allowed to die of embarrassment"".Gilbert Agar attended the Fourth National Motion Picture Conference of the Motion Picture Council in America in 1926, and reported that 95% of films released in Canada were from the United States. Eric Johnston stated that ""outside the U.S. itself, Canada ranks as the second largest market in the world for Hollywood films."" The amount of films in Canada of American origin declined to 68% by 1954, and 41% in 1962.Canadian directors, such as Norman Jewison, left Canada to work in the United States. Raoul Barré worked as a cartoonist in Canada before moving to the United States and working as an animator at Barré Studio. Stephen Bosustow and other animators left Walt Disney Animation Studios during the Disney animators' strike and founded United Productions of America.Seven Arts Productions, while being listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and having a majority of its investors be Canadians, had the majority of its productions done by its American subsidiary. It spent $25 million on ten American film productions, including Dr. Strangelove and What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?. Canadian 3D animation companies, such as Softimage and Alias Research, had their software used for American films, such as Jurassic Park.


== Reception ==

Productions from the NFB received 64 Academy Award nominations and ten victories by 2000. The Crawleys produced 2,500 films and won over 200 awards during their careers, including the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature Film for The Man Who Skied Down Everest.Churchill's Island, If You Love This Planet, and Neighbours were awarded the Academy Award for Best Documentary Short Film. The Sand Castle, Special Delivery, and Every Child were awarded the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. I'll Find a Way was awarded the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film.David Bairstow's Royal Journey won the BAFTA Award for Best Documentary in 1952.Colin Low's The Romance of Transportation in Canada was awarded the Prix du Film d'Animation at the Cannes Film Festival in 1953. Brault won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Director for Orders. 


== Censorship and preservation ==


=== Censorship ===

Ouimet's fine of $10 in February 1908, for having the Ouimetoscope open on Sundays was a test case to establish the power to close places of amusement on Sundays. In 1920, Pierre-François Casgrain opposed an attempt to remove a 15¢ per reel per day tax on film exhibitors stating that ""Pictures that are shown are an invitation to the people of the poorer classes to revolt, and they bring disorder into the country"". Fees implemented by the censorship boards earned the government large amounts of money with Alberta's two censorship boards making $12,275 in 1927. By 1921, New Brunswick had the lowest fee at $0.50 per reel while Ontario had the highest at $3 per reel, $1 per reel license for each copy. Appeals cost $5 in Quebec and $10 in Ontario. Variety reported in 1950 that censorship fees were costing the film industry over $1,450,000 per year, with $600,000 of the expense coming from Canada.Censorship boards were established in Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec in 1911, in Alberta and British Columbia in 1913, and in Nova Scotia in 1915. 5,500 reels of film were censored in the United Kingdom in 1925, compared to 6,639 reels in Quebec, 5,518 reels in Manitoba, and 5,013 reels in Alberta. Maclean's reported that the amount of films banned in Canada fell from one hundred one in 1932, to nineteen in 1940, with nine being banned in Quebec and none in Ontario. Three hundred of the six hundred films examined by censors in 1940 were censored. Quebec censors rejected all films the dealt with divorce. Multiple Russian films were banned due to ""suspected Communist propaganda"" and during World War II all foreign films, with the exception of France, were banned.Ontario banned all war films in 1914. The Canadian Militia initially ordered censorship boards in very province to condemn war films, but later created its own war films by 1915. In 1950, All Quiet on the Western Front was banned in Nova Scotia as there was a military recruitment drive happening.

Damaged Goods, a film about sexually transmitted infection, was banned in Ontario in 1916. Mutual Film screened the film to a selected audience, as a private showing it was exempt from the provincial censorship laws, and asked them if the film should be released. The audience approved of the film and Mutual Film appealed the ruling, but were unsuccessful. To combat the spread of sexual diseases a government campaign was initiated in the late 1910s. The Canadian National Council for Combating Venereal Disease, which was led by William Renwick Riddell and Gordon Bates, sought to distribute The End of the Road in Ontario in 1919. The censorship board was conflicted over maintaining its earlier ruling or allowing a government campaign to continue. The board rejected the film and the ruling was maintained on appeal. However, the ruling was reversed in 1920, and over 20,000 people saw the film within five days of its release and 40,000 by 1932. Other films about sexual diseases were allowed to be shown as well.
Censors were criticized starting in the 1950s for their abuse of power. Minister of Finance Hepburn banned all of The March of Time newsreels in 1942, without the board watching it, due to a Time article about him that he did not like. J. Bernard Hughes, the chief censor in British Columbia, banned Diary of a Nazi stating that it was ""purely Russian propaganda"" that depicted ""the Nazis at their worst"". Ernest Manning believed that the film industry in the United States was dominated by communists and sought to ban multiple films including Frank Sinatra's The House I Live In. The advent of television made it difficult for censors as they could not control the content being broadcast to Canada from the United States and had limited control over internal television broadcasts, with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation showing films that were banned in provinces in those provinces. Henry McLeod, a censor from Nova Scotia, stated that ""What's the point of banning a film when the trade can turn around and sell it to the CBC?"".The Canadian Federation of Film Societies, an organization with 25,000 members, called for the replacement of censorship boards with a rating system. In 1961, George Enos, who served as New Brunswick's censor for thirty years, stated that censorship ""is very undesirable"" and that ""Ninety percent of the worry is needless. Respectable people will condemn a bad picture. I don't like the idea of setting up one man to say what his neighbour shall see or not see. He would have to be a superman."" By the 1960s the Quebec censorship board was one of the largest with eighteen full-time staff employed compared to other provincial boards which had two to five full-time staff. By the 1970s the censorship boards were being transitioned to classification boards with the companies having to recut their films rather than the boards.The Hicklin test was used as the standard for film censorship until 1959, when the Criminal Code was amended and the Supreme Court of Canada overruled a ruling by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal that held that the Hicklin test was still in effect. The Columbus of Sex by John Hofsess was the first film in Canada charged with obscenity. The film was ordered to be destroyed following the trial, but the film's producers, Reitman and Daniel Goldberg, sold the rights to an American company that recut the film into My Secret Life.Last Tango in Paris was banned in Nova Scotia in 1974. Gerard McNeil, the editor of the Dartmouth Free Press, opposed the film's censorship and he filed a lawsuit in which he argued that the censors were acting illegally when they banned the film, citizens have a right to view uncensored films regardless of its content, and that the taxes and fees collected by the Amusements Board was to continue its illegal activities. The censors argued that McNeil had no standing to sue as he had no direct interest in the case, but the Nova Scotia Supreme Court stated that ""there could be a large number of persons with a valid desire to challenge"". The court ruled on 2 February 1976, that the provinces had no power to censor films under the British North America Acts. However, the Supreme Court of Canada overruled the court on 19 January 1978, in a five to four decision.


=== Preservation ===
The University of Alberta created a film library in 1917, and Quebec was the first province to utilize film in schools. The rights to Carry on, Sergeant! were acquired by the National Film Archive of Canada and reconstructed the film with Gordon Sparling, who worked on it as an assistant director, to show on television in 1968. The Canadian Film Archives was formed by the NFB in 1951.In 1924, the majority of Ouimet's Specialty Film Import's collection was destroyed by fire. The rising costs for the construction of the NFB's headquarters in Montreal resulted in the Department of Public Works cancelling the construction of film vaults. 13.1 million metres of archival footage worth $4.8 million (equivalent to $37,551,381 in 2021) was instead stored in Kirkland, Quebec, and were destroyed in a fire in July 1967.

Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute,"The Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute (AHURI) is a national not-for-profit independent network organization that funds, conducts, disseminates, and tailors research on housing, homelessness, cities and urban policy. The organisation's funding is received from the Australian Government, state and territory governments, as well as contributions from partner universities. As the only organisation in Australia dedicated exclusively to housing, homelessness, cities and related urban research, AHURI is a unique venture. Through its national network of university partners, AHURI undertakes research that supports policy development at all levels of government, assists industry in improving practice and informs the broader community. In 2022, AHURI had nine research partners across Australia.


== Reports ==
Through its National Housing Research Program (NHRP), AHURI publishes around 25 policy research reports each year. 
The developing National Cities Research Program produces several reports each year, and AHURI also publishes a range of commissioned reports for clients including governments, community sector organisations, and industry.
All NHRP and NCRP reports are freely available, and published along with plain language summaries, policy implication summaries and diverse dissemination and engagement outputs.


== Governance ==
The AHURI Board consists of 10 directors: four independent directors, one of whom serves as the independent Chair. One director is appointed from the Australian Government, two from state and territory governments, and two from participating universities. The Managing Director is an ex officio appointment to the Board.


=== Government Partners ===
The National Housing Research Program is funded through multi-lateral agreements involving the Australian Government and all state and territory governments. The NHRP funding agreements are typically 3 year agreements, and have been renewed continuously since 1999 in recognition of the impact of AHURI's work. 
Responsibility for housing policy sits with different departments in each jurisdiction (and name changes as well as structural changes to the machinery of government are not uncommon). In July 2022, the government departments associated with the NHRP funding agreement were:

The Treasury (Australia) (with responsibility shared with the Department of Social Services (Australia))
Department of Communities and Justice (New South Wales)
Department of Families, Fairness and Housing (Victoria)
Department of Communities, Housing and Digital Economy (Queensland)
Department of Communities (Western Australia)
South Australian Housing Authority
Department of Communities (Tasmania)
Housing ACT (Australian Capital Territory)
Department of Territory Families, Housing and Communities (Northern Territory)


== University Partners ==
AHURI has nine university partners, which are (with director/leader):
University of Sydney (Laurence Troy)
University of New South Wales (Hazel Easthope)
University of South Australia (Braam Lowies)
University of Adelaide (Emma Baker)
University of Tasmania (Catherine Robinson)
Monash University (Joshua Newman)
Swinburne University of Technology (Andi Nygaard)
RMIT University (Jago Dodson)
Curtin University (Steven Rowley)


== Activities ==
AHURI's main activities are:

National Housing Research Program - an annual, nationally competitive program funded by the Australian and all state/territory governments and managed by AHURI
National Cities Research Program - a developing program of research focusing on cities and urban policy
National Conference and Events Program - including the National Housing Conference, the National Homelessness Conference, one-day events, seminars, and webinars
Professional Services - commissioned research and policy developmentAHURI also provides in-depth analysis of current policy and practice issues, drawing on their research library critical to ensure the evidence base is accessible. With a research library comprising around 400 final reports from the NHRP and a range of other reports and materials, the Institute's analysis presents key findings, case studies, data and policy implications through our news channels, and online analyses and briefs.AHURI provides access to their catalogue of submissions made to key public government-led inquiries which provide an overview of the application of the AHURI evidence-base, as well as links to major media coverage of AHURI research, or senior AHURI staff’s evidence-informed commentary.


== Policy Development Research Model ==
AHURI has worked to increase its policy impact by transitioning from funding policy relevant research to a policy development research model (PDRM). The PDRM model has been developed and implemented by AHURI over more than a decade in its role as an intermediary between the research and policy communities. The PDRM integrates the traditionally separate processes of evidence building and policy development into one set of practices.AHURI has experimented with the traditional research project model to incorporate ways of building engagement into the conduct of research. The development of new ‘research vehicles’ that formalize processes of engagement throughout the research process have represented significant steps in the development of the PDRM. These have been created through innovative developments in research approaches, extensive collaboration in the AHURI research network, and the leadership of senior researchers. Two successful research vehicles (of several that have been trialled) have been the Investigative Panel and the AHURI Inquiry. 
The Investigative Panel was first introduced by AHURI in 2010. Researchers conduct Investigative Panels to bring together the available evidence and a range of experts to interrogate a specific policy or practice issue. The Investigative Panel draws together elements of key informant interview and focus group approaches to generate new knowledge through the expert discussions. Investigative Panels may be supported by other research activities or methods such as a literature review, synthesis, interviews or secondary data analysis, but the information from the panel members is an important contribution to the research. Investigative Panels have been used to address rapidly emerging policy concerns, with over thirty Investigative Panels held to date. Investigative Panels have been particularly effective in bringing practitioners and industry representatives into the research process.The AHURI Inquiry has become the flagship of the PDRM. AHURI Inquiries are substantial programs of research involving a suite of integrated research modules addressing substantial policy challenges. They are based on a commitment to multi-disciplinary and multi-method approaches to research. AHURI Inquiries have been designed to facilitate greater collaboration between the research, policy, and practitioner communities throughout the conduct of research. Inquiry evidence is generated from each of the modules, leveraging a range of research approaches to address complex problems. Because the overarching Inquiry sets the conceptual framework for understanding the policy issue, it is possible for evidence across discrete modules to be integrated and harnessed to address the policy problem. Each AHURI Inquiry is engaged with an Inquiry panel - drawing on a mix of policy and practice expertise from government, non-government and private sectors to consider the evidence and the outcomes of the research. The discussion of research evidence at Inquiry panel meetings, and the sharing of expertise and perspectives between researchers, policymakers, and practitioners informs policy development and practice innovation, and is captured in the final reports of the Inquiry. AHURI also fund research projects - using a wide range of transitional social and economic research methods.


== Research Agendas ==
Each year AHURI releases the NHRP Research Agenda. The Research Agenda is developed through consultation with senior government officials in the Australian Government, relevant state and territory government departments, as well as Research Centre Directors, and other key stakeholders. The NHRP Research Agenda is updated annually to provide direction in the development of this evidence-base and to set research topic priorities for the annual funding round.The NCRP issues periodic competitive research briefs on emerging urban policy concerns.

== History ==


=== AHURI Mark 1 ===
AHURI was founded in 1993 as an initiative by the then Deputy Prime Minister Brian Howe to conduct and coordinate research on housing and urban affairs. The brief for a research consortium was won by RMIT (Mike Berry and Tony Dalton), Monash University (Chris Maher ), QUT (Bob Stimson) and CSIRO (Joe Flood). The research was carried out in-house. 
The initial consortium was found to be unwieldy, with the necessity to go to every State and partner university to sign on decisions. 


=== AHURI Mark 2 ===
In 1999 a company structure was also adopted for AHURI, funded through a multilateral agreement between the Australian Government and state and territory governments, and universities able to become members of the Institute through an application process. CSIRO left the consortium, while the University of New South Wales, Swinburne University, Curtin University, and the University of Tasmania joined. Owen Donald became Executive Director. Ian Winter, a principal research fellow at the Institute of Family Studies was appointed as Research Director. When Donald was appointed as Victorian Director of Housing at the end of 2003, Winter took over as Executive Director and held the position until 2017, when Michael Fotheringham was appointed Managing Director.
As a unique partnership between the Australian Government and state and territory governments, and an Australia-wide network of university partners, AHURI has delivered vital research and insights that have guided governments and shaped community thinking. It has built a vast and informative evidence-base and advanced knowledge of housing, homelessness and urban issues. In 2019, to celebrate two decades of research, policy engagement, public events and research capacity building, AHURI produced the ’20 Years of AHURI’ commemorative publication. 


== Impact ==
AHURI bases its reputation on being a knowledge broker and an advisor, and its role is facilitative. 
To articulate the impact of AHURI’s work on policy and practice, the Institute began publishing annual Policy Impact Statements in 2015-16. AHURI produces an annual Policy Impact Statement at the end of each financial year, in addition to an Annual Financial Report. The Policy Impact Statement provides a concise summary of the achievements and activities of the organisation across our research, policy and engagement activities. This annual document provides a snapshot of the outcomes of AHURI activities described each year, drawing on metrics such as engagement with AHURI in developing housing strategies, citations of AHURI research in policy documents, report downloads, conference attendance and media mentions to demonstrate impact. 
Policy Impact Statements also include case studies of policy development work undertaken by AHURI in partnership with governments. As such they are not rigidly tied to reporting on key performance indicators, but summarize the diverse activities undertaken each year.
In line with the increasing trends toward the assessment of research impact in universities, AHURI began provides individual annual policy impact statements for each university, capturing the policy impact of each university’s contributions in the context of AHURI’s overall policy impact.
AHURI’s policy impact is often a process that builds over several years, so capturing longer-range policy impact is an area of ongoing development at AHURI, including 
development of policy impact narratives

Lea Valley Walk,"The Lea Valley Walk is a 50-mile (80 km) long-distance path located between Leagrave, the source of the River Lea near Luton, and the Thames, at Limehouse Basin, Limehouse, east London. From its source much of the walk is rural. At Hertford the path follows the towpath of the River Lee Navigation, and it becomes increasingly urbanised as it approaches London. The walk was opened in 1993 and is waymarked throughout using a swan logo.


== Route ==


=== Stage 1 Leagrave - Hatfield ===
Approximately 19.9 miles (32.0 km)

The walk can be accessed close to Leagrave railway station at Leagrave Common where there are a number of springs and ponds from which the Lea forms. The first part of the walk is through the suburbs of Luton. After passing through Wardown Park the path joins the A6 road and goes through the town centre passing St Mary's Church as it heads close to the runways of Luton Airport. The A505 road is crossed as the trail makes its way through open countryside towards Harpenden.
The path descends into the Lea Valley, passing under the railway lines before crossing the B653 road. The route now follows the track of a disused railway, the former Luton, Dunstable and Welwyn Junction line. After Harpenden the path leaves the railway track and heads uphill into Wheathampstead, then it goes through the village, past the church, and crosses over to the other bank of the river. The path now follows the river towards Water End Lane and the grounds of Brocket Hall where it crosses the middle of a golf course on its way towards Lemsford. The path goes under the A1 road to Stanborough Park.


=== Stage 2 Hatfield - Broxbourne ===
Approximately 16.1 miles (25.9 km)
The original path runs alongside the A414 road in the grounds of Home Park Hatfield  cutting through a small woodland to the Cecil Saw Mill. A short stretch of road leads to a bridleway and then the river. The path crosses the river at Holwell Bridge the trail continues through woodland opposite Holwell Court and joins the Cole Green Way. The path has been diverted due to access issues and now follows roads past the New QEII Hospital in Welwyn Garden City to join the Cole Green Way the disused Welwyn to Hertford railway line at the edge of the town. The route is shared with the Hertfordshire Chain Walk as it approaches the outskirts of Hertford. The path continues to Hertford town centre passing Hertford Town F.C and Hertford Castle before following Maidenhead Street and Bull Plain to rejoin the River Lea.
At this point the Lea becomes the canalised River Lee Navigation. For the remainder of its length, the walk follows the towpath all the way to the Thames. The first lock located at the edge of the town is Hertford Lock. The rivers Beane and Rib enter the Lea on the opposite bank. The walk passes through the town of Ware which is the start of Lee Valley Park. Passing Ware Lock, Victorian gazebos can be seen in some of the far bank riverside gardens. The path goes under the A1170 road opposite the Saracen's Head public house and then passing Hardmead Lock. On the far bank is Amwell Quarry, an SSSI. 

Stanstead Lock  is next before continuing under the A414 road towards Rye House, in Hoddesdon. Attractions nearby include Rye House Stadium, the gatehouse of Rye House and RSPB Rye Meads nature reserve
. Close to the confluence of the River Stort and Lea is Feildes Weir. Passing Feildes Weir Lock, the Rye House Power Station dominates the skyline. Crossing the river opposite the Fish and Eels public house which is above Dobbs Weir and then over the Hoddesdon to Nazeing road close to the Lee Valley Camping site (Permanently closed 2010) where a stretch of the Old River Lea can be seen. With the canal to the right the path passes Dobbs Weir Lock and then onto Carthagena Lock behind the lock is Carthagena Weir. Below the lock the tail end of the weir pool joins the main river. The path carries on under the Broxbourne to the Nazeing road bridge, close to Broxbourne railway station.


=== Stage 3 Broxbourne - Lea Bridge Road (Walthamstow Marshes) ===
Approximately 13.1 miles (21.1 km)

The Crown public house is located adjacent to towpath. Attractions in this area include a boat centre and Broxbourne Mill. Adjacent to the walk, the Lee Valley leisure pool closed in 2008. The river is crossed to the west bank by bridge. On the opposite bank there are a number of riverside houses. Over a small bridge under which flows the Broxbourne Mill Stream. Above Aqueduct Lock a channel from the river feeds into Kings Weir and a stretch of the Old River Lea can be found. On both sides of the river mature flooded gravel workings can be seen, a legacy of this areas large sand and gravel industry, some of which form part of the Turnford and Cheshunt Pits (SSSI). Continuing past Cheshunt Lock. Close to Cheshunt railway station is the Lee Valley Youth Hostel. A glimpse of the Small River Lea can be seen which flows nearby under Windmill Lane. Past Waltham Common Lock  and then Waltham Town Lock which is adjacent to the Showground Site the chosen venue to host the 2012 Summer Olympics canoeing and kayak slalom events will be known as the Broxbourne White Water Canoe Centre. The towns of Waltham Cross and Waltham Abbey are close by.

On the A121 road bridge stands the Old English Gentlemen public house ( closed May 2008 ). Close by are the Royal Gunpowder Mills which are open to the public. The path goes under the M25 motorway to Rammey Marsh Lock. The river splits on the far bank and a section of the Old River Lea flows through the former Royal Small Arms Factory now a housing development known as Enfield Island Village. The Victorian Terraced houses on the east bank are former Small Arms factory workers' houses known as Government Row. Above Enfield Lock a new bridge leads to the housing estate. Passing the Greyhound public house and the lock. Adjacent to the Rifles public house ( closed May 2008 ) is the Old River Lea and section 13 of the London Loop a Long-distance path can be joined. Crossing the bridge over the Swan and Pike pool a former barge turning basin.

The grassed embankment of the King George V Reservoir is directly in front and is the first in the Lee Valley Reservoir Chain. Turkey Brook joins the Lee on the opposite bank. The far bank now comprises mainly industrial units. At Brimsdown Mossops Bridge connects to Mossops Creek and the  Brimsdown Industrial Estate area. Before the paired lock gates at Ponder's End Lock come into view. The Ponders End Mill Stream leaves the Navigation to flow through the historic Wright's Flour Mill close by to Ponders End railway station. Above Ponders End lock opposite the towpath is the Navigation Inn, a former pumping station built in 1899. The inn offers moorings for passing boats and views of the grassed embankment of the King George V reservoir. Past the lock and under a road bridge the mill stream merges with the Lee on the far bank. To the east is the start of the William Girling Reservoir. The west bank opens up with views of the golf course– part of the Lee Valley Leisure Complex.
At Pickett's Lock the Pymmes Brook Trail can be joined. From the lock the 100 metre chimney of the Edmonton Incinerator dominates the skyline, and on the horizon the towers of Canary Wharf and the Swiss Re can be clearly seen. Following the towpath under the North Circular Road past the site of the Cooks Ferry Inn public house (well known music venue-demolished late 20th century for road widening). Both sides of the river are industrialised. The river opens up with views of Banbury Reservoir to the East and Tottenham Marshes. Under a small footbridge known locally as Chalk Bridge. Walking towards Stonebridge Lock with Lockwood Reservoir to the east.

Crossing the river here it is less than 1 mile to Tottenham Lock. Pymmes Brook joins the Lee here. To the East are the High Maynard and Low Maynard reservoirs. Passing under Ferry Lane A503 road bridge. Close by is the Ferry Boat Inn public house and Tottenham Hale station. The path passes under the London Overground Gospel Oak to Barking line and Lea Valley Lines railway bridges as the towpath skirts the West Warwick Reservoir further to the east are the East Warwick Reservoir and the Walthamstow Reservoirs. The Coppermill Stream joins the Lea close to the Lee Valley Marina.Passing by Springfield Park the path crosses the river at Horseshoe Bridge. Passing under the Lea Valley Lines rail bridge. Walthamstow Marshes and Leyton Marshes are passed as the path heads towards Lea Bridge Road.


=== Stage 4 Lea Bridge Road (Walthamstow Marshes) - Limehouse Basin ===
Approximately 4.9 miles (7.9 km)
Amenities in Lea Bridge Road area include the Lee Valley Ice Centre, riding stables and two nature reserves; the Middlesex Filter Beds and the Waterworks Nature Reserve. The river splits at the Middlesex Filter Beds Weir where a section of the River Lea's natural channel flows in an easterly direction can be found.

Kentucky Marijuana Strike Force,"The Kentucky Marijuana Strike Force, also known as the Kentucky Governor's Marijuana Strike/Task Force, is a multi-agency law enforcement task force managed by the Office of the Governor of Kentucky and Kentucky State Police Marijuana Suppression Branch, and composed of local, state and federal agencies organized expressly to eradicate illegal cannabis cultivation and trafficking in Kentucky. The task force was established in 1990,  to combat marijuana cultivation on public lands in Kentucky that ranks third in the United States, behind California and Tennessee. An estimated $1 billion worth of marijuana in seized in Kentucky annually.In the wake of the 1989 arrest of the Cornbread Mafia by the Western Kentucky OCDETF, the task force was created in July 1990 by executive order from then Kentucky Governor Wallace Wilkinson. with the backing of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.Member agencies include the Kentucky Justice Cabinet, Kentucky State Police, Kentucky National Guard, Kentucky Fish and Wildlife, Office of the Attorney General of Kentucky, National Park Service, Civil Air Patrol, Drug Enforcement Administration, US Forest Service, US Marshalls Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Kentucky and local sheriff and police departments. The strike force often uses helicopters to fly eradication teams into remote marijuana grow sites in Eastern Kentucky.Much of the enforcement efforts of the Kentucky Marijuana Strike Force, that occur during the eradication season that lasts from April to October, are concentrated in the area of the Daniel Boone National Forest, in the Appalachian region of eastern Kentucky historically associated with moonshine production, which often ranks first for most marijuana plants eradicated from a national forest in the United States. The eradication effort in the Daniel Boone National Forest showed the most impacts when just 17,000 plants were eradicated from the forest in 2009, compared to the 250,000 plants seized the year before.

Belgicism (French),"A belgicism (French: belgicisme) is a word, expression, or turn of phrase that is unique to Belgian French. Even though the French spoken in Belgium is closer to the French spoken in France than the French spoken by Québécois, there are a considerable number of words and phrases that have disappeared from common usage in other Francophone nations that remain common in everyday Belgian speech.
Certain words used in Belgium that are not used in Standard French are also found in northern France and in Switzerland, for example chicon ('endive') and septante ('seventy', unlike the vigesimal soixante-dix, or 'sixty-ten', used in France.) In these cases, these words are sometimes not classified as being solely belgicisms.


== Origins of Belgicisms ==
Belgium has three national official languages, and consequently, the French spoken in the French part of Belgium is considerably under the influence of the languages of the other Belgian regions, and is also enriched by vocabulary from the languages of neighbouring countries. In addition, there's also influence from English on Belgian-French distinct from its influence on French-French (e.g., the word boiler is not used in Metropolitan French).
Belgian French is also enriched by vocabulary from other regional Romance languages, such as Picard, Walloon, Lorrain and Champenois. Belgicisms directly influenced by Walloon are specifically called Wallonisms.


== Different types of belgicisms ==
One can point to:

phonetic belgicisms, which are not written differently from standard French words, but are pronounced differently:
Many Belgians pronounce <ui> /ɥi/ like /wi/, unlike French speakers of French. Most French individuals notice a difference between the two sounds, but many Belgians do not. Another difference in pronunciation stems from how loan words with the letter 'w' are pronounced. Belgian Francophones tend to always pronounce w as /w/ in words like wagon /waɡɔ̃/ whereas in Standard French, this would be pronounced /vaɡɔ̃/, since French Francophones generally pronounce /w/ like /v/. In these cases, however, /ɥi/ and /v/ (the latter in ""wagon"" but not in ""wallon"") are supposed to be the norm.
The distinction between the nasal vowels /ɛ̃/ and /œ̃/ is upheld, whereas in many regions of France, these two sounds have merged. Thus, although for many French people, brin (stalk) and brun (brown), are homophones, for Belgians they are not.
The distinction between long and short vowels is also upheld, which can create minimal pairs in the presence of a mute ending consonant: e.g. ""bot"" (as in un pied bot, a club foot) and ""beau"" (beautiful) are not homonyms in Belgian French, creating minimal pairs of sentences like J'ai vu son pied gauche, il était bot (~ I saw she was club-footed on the left) vs. J'ai vu son pied gauche, il était beau (~ I saw she had a beautiful left foot). (In this particular case, ""bot"" might be heard as [boʔ] or [bo] depending on idiolect or regiolect, vs. ""beau"" [boː].)
Another unusual aspect of Belgian French is the clear difference between the pronunciation of 'ai' and 'ais' at the end of a word. Belgians pronounced the first like an /e/ and the second like an /ɛ/. As a consequence, Belgians rarely confuse the future tense and conditional when writing.
Belgian speakers pronounce the final T in certain words that some French do not: for example, huit (eight) and vingt (twenty) are pronounced /wɪt/ and /vɛ̃t/ respectively before a pause.
Archaic belgicisms that come from the foreign rule over Belgium in the past. Belgium has been occupied by Dutch, English, Spanish, Austrian, French and German powers, all of which have indubitably laid a footprint on Belgian French. Also worth mentioning is the use of 'septante' and 'nonante' for 70 and 90 respectively.  Although these words are used in Switzerland and in the Democratic Republic of Congo, as well as in Jersey legal French, in the rest of the Francophone world, the ventigesimal 'soixante-dix' and 'quatre-vingt-dix' are used. Also échevin (which existed in Ancien régime French but was replaced in France by adjoint au maire) is still the official Belgian terms for the members of a township's executive power.
Belgicisms that were manufactured by the Belgian government. Like France and Québec, Belgium too has an administration in place to prescribe language use. Belgium undertook a series of measures to combat linguistic sexism by creating feminine versions of masculine gender occupations. For example, professeur and docteur had no feminine-gender equivalent words, even though many women had these occupations. In March 1989, the Belgian administration prescribed that all jobs would have a grammatically masculine and feminine form (le docteur could be la doctoresse.) This feminization of words has no official equivalent in metropolitan France.
Belgicisms of Germanic origin such as the word bourgmestre which comes from the Dutch burgemeester and refers to the mayor of a village or township.
Belgicisms with different meanings to other variants of French. Some words have a different meaning in Belgium from those in other Francophone countries:
La cassonade in Belgium is a light or dark brown sugar extracted from beets; in Québec, it is a brown cane sugar.
What is called endive in France is called chicorée in Belgium and vice versa. (The chicon is a (Belgian) chicorée grown in the dark to keep it white rather than green.)
outre-Quiévrain is used to refer to Belgium by the French, and to France by the Belgians; Quiévrain is the border crossing point on the old main Paris-Brussels railway line.
Words for new concepts created separately in Belgium and in France. For instance, Belgian logopède vs. French orthophoniste, independently formed on different Greek roots to mean ""a speech therapist"". Similarly, Belgian un parastatal vs. French un organisme semi-public.

Alfred Edward Chalon,"Alfred Edward Chalon  (15 February 1780 – 3 October 1860) was a Swiss-born British portraitist. He lived in London where he was noticed by Queen Victoria.


== Biography ==
Alfred Chalon was born in Geneva from a father who soon was hired as professor at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in England.
With his brother John James Chalon (1778–1854), Alfred became an artist. Entered at the Royal Academy in 1797, he joined the Associated Artists in Water-Colours, a group of aquarellists. In the Academy, he was elected an associate (ARA) in 1812, then academician (RA) in 1816.
Known for his portraits of the good society of London, he was chosen by Queen Victoria to paint a gift to her mother: Victoria in her State robes going to the House of Lords for her first official act, the prorogation of the Parliament, on 17 July 1837. After this task, Chalon was entitled Portrait Painter in Water Colour to Her Majesty and gained some celebrity. His 1837 portrait was engraved by Samuel Cousins and distributed to the public the day of Victoria's coronation, the 28 June 1838; and the next year Cousins produced a second, smaller, engraving. Then, starting in 1851, the ""Chalon head"" appeared on some British colonies' postage stamps.
Bachelors, the Chalon brothers lived together. In 1860, Alfred died at Campden Hill, in Kensington, London and was buried with his brother in Highgate Cemetery.

The Caravan,"The Caravan is an Indian English-language, long-form narrative journalism magazine covering politics and culture.


== History ==
In 1940, Vishwa Nath launched Caravan as the first magazine from the Delhi Press; it went on to establish itself as a leading monthly for the elites but closed in 1988.It was again revived in 2009 by Anant Nath, the grand son of Vishwa Nath; Nath was deeply impressed by publications like The Atlantic, Mother Jones etc. during his graduation from Columbia University and sought for The Caravan to be a home for S. Asia's rich literary talents. In Nath's words, ""the idea was [] to have a magazine on politics, art, and culture, with a liberal bend of mind."" A few months later, Vinod Jose was roped in as the executive editor; drawing inspiration from long-form American magazines such as Harper's and The New Yorker, he designed the magazine as the home for New Journalism in India. The establishment was successful and its earliest issues featured a host of giants in S. Asian Anglophone cannon — Pankaj Mishra, Arundhati Roy, and Fatima Bhutto among others.Gradually, both Nath and Jose planned to cover stories that were ignored by mainstream media — Siddhartha Deb notes the magazine to have simultaneously carried traits of being a newsweekly, book review forum, and a litzine, during those days. By 2010, the journal had become a monthly and the print-circulation exceeded 40,000; Jonathan Shainin joined the same year as an associate editor. Beginning 2014, with the rise of Narendra Modi in national politics, the magazine has become almost exclusively focused on politics — Nath explains this as a product of mainstream media's increasing reticence to be critical of the government.As of 2020, the magazine employs 38 people and the website gets about 1.5 million pageviews per month.


== Reception ==
Jose's profile of Narendra Modi in the issue of March, 2012 won international acclaim and was referenced to by The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, The Guardian, Le Monde, and The New York Times. Dexter Filkins writing for The New Yorker in 2019, noted The Caravan to be the most prominent among the few media outlets who dared to provide critical coverage of the incumbent Bharatiya Janata Party government notwithstanding state-intimidation.In summer 2020, Virginia Quarterly Review commissioned a feature on the magazine, which introducing it as a publication committed to ""protecting India’s tradition of democracy and religious pluralism"", reiterated Filkin's observation and emphasized the relevance of the publication at a time when the traditional mainstream media had all but buckled before the government. That the Caravan did not receive advertisements from the government, it was not possible for the government to use the traditional ""carrot and stick"" approach.


=== Awards ===


==== Individual journalists ====
Multiple journalists have received awards for their reportage published in The Caravan. 
In 2010, Mehboob Jeelani won a Ramnath Goenka Award for his profile of Syed Ali Geelani. In 2011, Jose won a Ramnath Goenka Award for his profiles of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and DMK patriarch M. Karunanidhi; two years later, he was conferred with the Osborn Elliott Prize by the Asia Society for two articles — one on the rebranding of Narendra Modi after the Gujarat Riots, and the other on media ethics. In 2011, Christophe Jaffrelot had also won the Ramnath Goenka Award for a series of op-eds. In 2012, Samanth Subramanian was conferred with Red Ink Award in the category of political reporting as well as media reporting by the Mumbai Press Club for his profiles of Subramanian Swamy and Samir Jain respectively. 
In 2014, the publication swept Red Ink Awards — Dinesh Narayanan won two in the category of political reporting for a profile of Mohan Bhagwat and in the category of business reporting for a profile of Jignesh Shah, Leena Gita Reghunath won the one in the category of crime reporting for a profile of Swami Aseemanand, Salil Tripathi won the one in the category of human rights reporting for a discussion of the 1971 war-crimes in Bangladesh, Nikita Saxena won the one in the category of health reporting, and Rahul Bhatia won the one in the category of sports reporting for a profile of N. Srinivasan. Bhatia also won a Ramnath Goenka Award for the same article.In 2018, Nileena M S won the ACJ Journalism Award in the category of investigative reporting for detailing the rampant corruption in the allocation of coal-blocks in Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan. The same year,  Reghunath won a Red Ink Award for her reporting of gender-biases in Malayalam television under the women empowerment category while Aruna Chandrasekhar won another in the environment category for reporting on the tribal opposition to bauxite mining in Orissa. In 2019, Sagar won Red Ink Award in the category of political reporting for investigative reporting on the Rafale scam while Zishaan A Latif won a Ramnath Goenka Award for documenting the struggles of inclusion in NRC. In 2020, Prabhjit Singh and Arshu John's probings into the Delhi riots won them the ACJ Journalism Award in the category of investigative reporting. In 2021, Sagar won Red Ink Award in the category of crime reporting for his fact-checking of claims made by Central Bureau of Investigation in the context of Muzaffarpur shelter case.


==== Publication ====
In 2021, the publication was conferred with the Louis M. Lyons Award for Conscience and Integrity in Journalism by the Nieman Foundation for Journalism's class of the year at Harvard University; the citation highlighted Caravan's ""commitment to conscience and integrity"" notwithstanding intimidatory tactics by the state.


== Lawsuits and intimidation ==
In addition to receiving threatening messages, the magazine has been sued repeatedly for alleged defamation. These lawsuits are costly and typically take years to fight in court. In 2011, the magazine was the subject of a Rs 50 crore defamation suit by the Indian Institute of Planning and Management after it featured a profile of its head, Arindam Chaudhuri.  During the years-long lawsuit, the magazine was ordered to take the article off its website.  In 2018, the High Court allowed the magazine to re-publish the article, but the gag order was partly reinstated by a different court two months later.The magazine was issued legal notices in April 2013 regarding its May cover story about Attorney General Goolam Essaji Vahanvati but the top three editors decided to continue with its publication.In 2015, The Caravan was served a legal notice by the Essar Group because the magazine described the business and the family that runs it unfavorably, including evidence that the business gave iPads to 195 journalists, government employees, and politicians. Essar later filed a ₹250 crore civil defamation suit against the magazine; the business did not deny any of the facts presented in the magazine article.In 2021, many journalists and politicians who reported about the death of Navreet Singh during the 2021 Farmers' Republic Day parade were charged with sedition by the Delhi Police and the police departments of three Bharatiya Janata Party–ruled states. The police cases were filed against editor and founder Paresh Nath, editor Anant Nath, executive editor Vinod K. Jose and one unnamed person. Those charged also included Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, India Today journalist Rajdeep Sardesai, National Herald senior consulting editor Mrinal Pande and Qaumi Awaz editor Zafar Agha. Varadarajan has called the police FIR ""malicious prosecution"". The Press Club of India (PCI), the Editors Guild of India, the Press Association, the Indian Women's Press Corps (IWPC), the Delhi Union of Journalists and the Indian Journalists Union in a joint press conference asked the sedition law to be scrapped. The Editors Guild of India spoke against invoking of the sedition charge on journalists. The guild termed the FIRs as an ""attempt to intimidate, harass, browbeat and stifle the media"".

Flower (Tomiko Van song),"""Flower"" is Tomiko Van's debut single under the Avex Trax label. The single was released on June 7, 2006 in two formats.


== Overview ==
""Flower"" is former Do As Infinity lead singer Tomiko Van's debut single. Released in two versions, CD only and CD+DVD, there are two different covers for the single, though the covers have very little differences to them. The A-side song ""Flower"" was used as the TBS drama Oishii Proposal theme song, and a piano version of the song was used for the sound track of the drama. The B-side ""Brave"" was used as the ending theme song for PlayStation 2 game Sengoku Basara 2.
Unlike most of the songs on her debut album, ""Flower"" is an up-tempo pop song with a feeling of summer to it. The song features guitars, an instrument that was not as prominent in her debut album, and is reminiscent of songs that she would sing during her times in Do As Infinity.

Mary Evans,"Mary Evans (1770–1843), later Mary Todd, is notable as the first love of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and although he failed to profess his feelings to Evans during their early relationship, he held her in affection until 1794 when Evans dissuaded his attentions.


== Relationship to Coleridge ==
After the death of his father in 1781, Coleridge attended Christ's Hospital, a boarding school in London. While in London, Coleridge befriended several boys at the school, including Tom Evans. During 1788 he and other friends visited Tom Evans' home in London, where he met Tom's eldest sister, Mary Evans. Coleridge became infatuated with Evans.
Evans became Coleridge's first love: ""whom for five years I loved-almost to madness"". Although he felt passionately about her, he did not share his feelings with her, and when he happened to see her leaving a church in Wrexham in 1794 he 'turned sick and all but fainted away'. The ""relationship"" lasted only a short while, and in October 1795, she married Fryer Todd.
When Coleridge made plans with friend and future brother-in-law, Robert Southey, to emigrate to the ""banks of the Susquahanna,"" Evans wrote to Coleridge imploring him not to go. The letter reopened old feelings for Coleridge, inspiring the poem ""Sonnet: To my Own Heart,"" which he published in his ""three earlier and three later collections, as well as in Sonnets from Various Authors and has also received the title On a Discovery Made to Late.  The poem was also included in letters to Robert Southey and Francis Wrangham in October, 1794, and he inserts several of the lines into a response letter to Evans in early November, after hearing of her engagement plans. Coleridge and Evans met again for the last time in 1808.


== The Sigh ==
Coleridge dedicated his poem The Sigh (1794) to Mary Evans, who is mentioned by name in the poem.

When Youth his faery reign began
Ere Sorrow had proclaim'd me man;
While Peace the present hour beguil'd,
And all the lovely Prospect smil'd;
Then Mary! 'mid my lightsome glee
I heav'd the painless Sigh for thee.And when, along the waves of woe,
My harass'd Heart was doom'd to know
The frantic burst of Outrage keen,
And the slow Pang that gnaws unseen;
Then shipwreck'd on Life's stormy sea
I heaved an anguish'd Sigh for thee!But soon Reflection's power imprest
A stiller sadness on my breast;
And sickly Hope with waning eye
Was well content to droop and die:
I yielded to the stern decree,
Yet heav'd a languid Sigh for thee!And though in distant climes to roam,
A wanderer from my native home,
I fain would soothe the sense of Care,
And lull to sleep the Joys that were!
Thy Image may not banish'd be--
Still, Mary! still I sigh for thee.

"Elgin Academy (Elgin, Illinois)","Elgin Academy is an independent, coeducational, college-preparatory school in Elgin, Illinois, United States. Elgin Academy is notable for many accomplishments, such as its Scholastic Bowl and ACES teams.


== History ==
The academy was established by charter of the Illinois General Assembly in 1839 to provide students with a classical education. The academy's original building, Old Main, was constructed in 1855-6, and is on the United States' National Register of Historic Places. It now serves as a museum of the Elgin Area Historical Society.
The original charter was granted by the Illinois legislature and signed in 1839, only four years after the founding of Elgin. The academy opened, and has continued, with a non-denominational and coeducational policy. In 1856 the first building, Old Main, was completed at a cost of $19,000 and opened for classes, but the first diploma was not awarded until 1872 when Laura Davidson, the granddaughter of James Gifford, Elgin's founder, earned the honor.  Davidson later married Nathaniel Sears and their family became major donors to the academy.
During the American Civil War seven commissioned officers, six non-commissioned officers, and 21 privates served from the academy. All together, 153 Civil War veterans, whose names are inscribed on the base of two authentic Union cannons, were associated with the academy.
In 1874, 274 students were enrolled and high school degrees were offered in the areas of College Preparatory, Normal, English, Classical, Latin-Scientific, and Business. By 1900 the football team, basketball team, and a school newspaper were established.  About this time the academy became briefly associated with the University of Chicago and then with Northwestern University from 1903 to 1927 and from 1932 to 1943.  The Sears family helped build the academy's first gymnasium in 1918. A boarding program ran from 1920 to 1987, with girls allowed to board starting in 1941.The Sears family helped build the Sears Art Gallery in 1924 and Sears Hall in 1940.  The new gymnasium was built in 1958, North Hall was built as a girls' dormitory in 1962, and Edwards Hall was built in 1969.  Old Main was closed in 1972.
Enrollment fell to 85 students in 1973, but rose to 425 in 2012.  In 1984 the program was expanded to K-12, and preschool was added in 1997. The Harold D. Rider Family Media, Science, and Fine Arts Center opened in 2008.Enrollment fell back down to 200 in 2023, and on November 7, 2023, the school officially announced its planned closing. The school is planned to close at the end of the 2023-2024 school year.


== Facilities ==
The school occupies a 18-acre (73,000 m2) campus 35 miles (56 km) northwest of Chicago in the Historic District of the city of Elgin. The school's classrooms are largely housed in four buildings:

The Harold D. Rider Family Media, Science and Fine Arts Center houses the Kimball Street Theatre and part of the Liautaud-Lyons Upper School program, partially donated by the philanthropic James ""Jimmy John"" Liautaud.

== The Academy today ==
The academy offers an academic, college-preparatory curriculum. It is a member of the National Association of Independent Schools and is accredited by both the Independent Schools Association of the Central States and the AdvancEd commission.

He was a Deputy Chairman and then Vice-President of the Royal Commonwealth Society, which he addressed in 1963, and Governor of Guy's Hospital.


== Family ==
Walston married Catherine Crompton (1916–1978) in 1935, in the USA. Oliver Walston, a farmer and agricultural writer, is their second son. From 1946 Catherine was the  mistress of the author Graham Greene, who was also her godfather. Walston demanded that the adulterous relationship cease after the 1951 publication of The End of the Affair, Greene's roman à clef, but it continued, ending by about 1966. After Catherine's death, Walston married Elizabeth Scott, who had previously been the wife of Conservative MP Nicholas Scott.Press reports that Betty Boothroyd, who acted as Walston's secretary before herself entering politics, had been his mistress and also cared for his six children by Catherine, were the subject of a successful libel case brought by Boothroyd.


== In politics ==
Walston served as Member of the Huntingdonshire War Agricultural Committee (1939–45), Director of Agriculture for the British Zone of Germany (1946–47), Counsellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (1948–50), Agricultural Adviser for Germany to the Foreign Office (1964–67) and Chairman of the Institute of Race Relations (1968–71).
In the early 1940s he was selected as Liberal prospective parliamentary candidate for King's Lynn. In 1945 his booklet From Forces to Farming was published by the Liberal Party. The booklet called for state aided co-operative farming for ex-servicemen. He did not contest King's Lynn, instead switching to contest Huntingdonshire later that year at the general election.
He never managed to become a member of parliament despite contesting seats five times: Huntingdonshire in 1945 for the Liberals; Cambridgeshire in 1951 and 1955 for Labour; and Gainsborough in the 1956 by-election and in 1959, again for Labour. On 10 February 1961 he was created a life peer as Baron Walston, of Newton in the County of Cambridge. A supporter of Hugh Gaitskell, he was a member of the Campaign for Democratic Socialism.


=== Junior minister ===
Walston served in the First Wilson ministry, as Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs from 20 October 1964 to the beginning of 1967.In internal Foreign Office discussion, Walston supported James Cable's line, that the USA should cut its losses in the Vietnam War, and argued that the UK should have a pro-active policy of seeking peace. By the second half of 1965 Walston was in fact pushing this line harder than Cable himself. In June 1966 Walston was passing through South Vietnam on an envoy mission, when he was contacted by Janusz Lewandowski, who said he was acting for the Polish government and attempting to find peace in the Vietnam War. Walston, however, treated this as a freelance approach.Following Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) Walston was envoy to Portugal, attempting to negotiate an end to sanction-breaking pumping of oil to Southern Rhodesia via Beira, Mozambique. His diplomacy was overtaken by Security Council resolution 221 of 9 April 1966. As a Foreign Office junior minister, Walston argued that the UK government should not grant Rhodesian independence except on terms of majority rule. While Rhodesia was the responsibility of the Commonwealth Relations Office, he maintained that UDI had increased the chances of communist penetration in Africa and that this was a proper concern of the Foreign Office.During this time at the Foreign Office, Walston was a trustee of one of John Collins's secret Christian Action trusts, channelling funds to the African National Congress. He expressed very positive feelings about Fidel Castro. Walston was then Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade, in 1967.


=== Later political life ===
On a lecture tour of South Africa in 1968, Walston had private discussions with B. J. Vorster, and as a consequence attempted to open a channel of communication to Kenneth Kaunda. He also visited Nelson Mandela on Robben Island, concluding that he was being well treated by his gaolers. During this period the South African government wished to broker a deal between the UK and Ian Smith, and to use Walston's contacts.Walston was a member of the Council of Europe between 1970 and 1975, and a Member of the European Parliament from 1975 to 1977. In the period from 1970 to 1976 several Labour politicians met at his apartment in The Albany, eventually forming a retrospectively-christened ""Walston group"" of pro-European MPs who were supportive of the leading right-wing figure in the party, Roy Jenkins.Along with most members of that group, Walston joined the Social Democratic Party (SDP) upon its foundation in 1981. Unusually for an associate of Jenkins, however, he chose not to support the SDP's merger with the Liberals in 1988, despite his former association with that party; instead he followed David Owen into the newly-formed 'continuing' SDP, becoming its first chief whip in the Lords. Walston also became active during this time with the UN-accredited non-governmental organisation Agri-Energy Roundtable, and served as its vice-chairman for several years.


== Pamphlets ==
Walston published political pamphlets on agricultural topics:

From Forces to Farming. A Plan for the Ex-Service Man (1944), Liberal Party Publication Department; as prospective Liberal Party candidate for King's Lynn.
Land Nationalisation: For and Against (1958), Fabian Society Issue 312. With John Mackie.
The Farmer and Europe (1962), Fabian Society. On planning for farming if the UK joined the Common Market.
Agriculture under Communism (1962).

Owen Glenn,"Sir Owen George Glenn  (born 19 February 1940) is an Indian-New Zealand expatriate businessman and philanthropist, who supports humanitarian causes worldwide through his family charity.


== Early life ==
Born in Calcutta, British India, on 19 February 1940, Glenn emigrated with his family to New Zealand in 1952. He attended Balmoral Intermediate School and Mount Roskill Grammar School in Auckland. He became a naturalised New Zealand citizen in 1961.


== Career ==
Glenn is the founder and former executive chairman of Vanguard Logistics Services, the USA's largest neutral non-vessel operating common carrier [logistics industry participant] and among the top five largest NVOCCs in the world. 


== Philanthropy ==
In 2002, Glenn donated $7.5 million to the University of Auckland for the development of the Business School's premises and facilities and ongoing improvements. This contribution is believed to be the largest private donation in New Zealand educational history, and was driven by Glenn's belief in the business school's mission and in the benefits high quality business education holds for New Zealand business and society. As a result of this gift the business school's complex, opened in early 2008, was named the Owen G. Glenn Building. Owen Glenn followed his initial $7.5 million donation by, in 2008, donating an additional $500,000 to establish the Barry Spicer and Owen G Glenn PhD Scholarships. These scholarships received matched funding of $250,000.
In 2008 Glenn claimed that the New Zealand government was considering making him the country's honorary consul in Monaco, but such an appointment never eventuated. His political donations to the New Zealand Labour Party and New Zealand First, which both the political parties denied receiving, caused some controversy in New Zealand politics at around the same time. On 9 September 2008, Glenn gave evidence to the New Zealand Parliament's Privileges Committee regarding the accuracy of statements made by Winston Peters, Leader of New Zealand First, about the donations Glenn had given to Peters. Parliament ultimately censured Peters for failing to declare the donations.Glenn supports a number of international charities through the Glenn Family Foundation and helped establish the International SeaKeepers Society. The foundation also supported Hockey NZ, helped it achieve rights to the hosting of the 2011 Champions Trophy, which were taken from India due to organisation failures.Following the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, Glenn donated $1 million to the Christchurch earthquake recovery fund on behalf of the Glenn Family Foundation. He stated, ""I grew up in New Zealand, it holds a special place in my heart and to see such devastation, such hurt and such loss makes you want to help. This donation is something I can do and I strongly urge other expatriate business people to do the same. We all need to pull together and while we are a small country, it is a country made up of people with huge hearts. That's what gets you through in times like this.""


== New Zealand Warriors involvement ==
In 2000, Glenn became a shareholder of the New Zealand Warriors rugby league team. After his relationship with 50% shareholder Eric Watson became dysfunctional, Glenn first considered putting his shares into a trust for the benefit of New Zealand Warrior fans. However, he ultimately sold his 50% stake to Watson in November 2015.


== Dispute with Eric Watson ==
Between 2012 and 2017, Glenn’s business relationship with high profile NZ businessman Eric Watson soured, particularly in relation to British property investments. Glenn successfully challenged Watson in court and was awarded a comprehensive win with over £129million in damages owed to Glenn. As at December 2019, Watson was struggling to pay compensation and interest. Glenn has said he will pursue former business partner Eric Watson ""to the ends of the earth — if necessary taking action against his trusts and third parties holding assets on his behalf — to ensure he pays every penny that is found due.""   


== Honours and awards ==
In the 2008 New Year Honours, Glenn was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to business and the community.In May 2011, Glenn was awarded CPA Australia's highest honour—Honorary Fellow of CPA (FCPA)—in recognition of his global entrepreneurial success.In the 2013 New Year Honours, Glenn was promoted to Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to philanthropy.

"Rocky Ridge, Utah","Rocky Ridge is a town on the northeastern edge of Juab County, Utah, United States. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 733, and in 2018 the estimated population was 833.The town is located on the northern edge of the Juab Valley in the eastern foothills of the Wasatch Range, but entirely west of Interstate 15 (I‑15). It is part of the Provo–Orem, Utah Metropolitan Statistical Area.
While there is a ""Rocky Ridge"" and a ""Rocky Ridge Canyon"" in northeastern Juab County (both located east of the city of Nephi, approximately 16 miles [26 km] south‑southeast of the community), the town was named for ""the rocks, in a bountiful array of types and colors, strewn plentifully across the surrounding ridges separating Juab and Utah counties,"" according to the town website.


== History ==
The original community in the area was known as York and was the southern terminus of the Utah Southern Railroad from February 1875 to May 1979. (The Utah Southern Railroad was controlled by the Union Pacific Railroad.) However, after the railroad was extended further south, the community of York was essentially abandoned. A post office had been established in the community in 1875, but it closed in 1879.Nearly a century passed without much change, but by 1971 Marvin L. Allred had purchased 225 acres (91 ha) in the area and I‑15 had been completed to just north of the Juab‑Utah county line. Over the next quarter century the community (which had become known as locally as Allred Ranch) continued growing, with the completion of I‑15 through the valley and the addition of more than 950 acres (380 ha) to the community.In May 1996, the Juab County Commissioners received a petition to incorporate the area under the name ""Rocky Ridge"". (A few years prior some residents of the area had petitioned unsuccessfully for incorporation under the name ""York"".) The later petition indicated that the population of the area had reached 210. By October of that year, the petition for incorporation was approved.

Livingston South railway station,"Livingston South railway station is one of two railway stations serving Livingston in West Lothian, Scotland. It is located on the Shotts Line, 14 miles (23 km) west of Edinburgh Waverley on the way to Glasgow Central. It is managed by ScotRail, who provide all train services.
The town of Livingston also has another railway station, Livingston North, on the North Clyde Line.


== History ==
The station was opened by British Rail on 6 October 1984. The station has two platforms, connected by a subway, which was originally a cattle creep under the railway embankment at this point. The platforms were of timber construction.
In April 2018 the station underwent a £3.5 million transformation to upgrade it as part of a project to electrify the Edinburgh Waverley-Glasgow Central line.


== Services ==
In 2010 it was served, Monday to Saturday, by one service each hour from Glasgow Central to Edinburgh Waverley. One train a day from Edinburgh terminates at Motherwell and one starts from there. An additional hourly 'semi fast' service also now (May 2016) calls, giving the station a frequency of two trains per hour between Edinburgh and Glasgow. This latter service only calls at Haymarket en route to Edinburgh and at West Calder, Shotts & Bellshill when heading to Glasgow.
There is a limited Sunday service at this station to Edinburgh and Glasgow (six trains each way per day).The staple passenger traction on services using this station is the Class 385  EMU.

From 2011 to 2012, he represented the 17th District as a member of the Ohio Senate. From 2003 to 2010, he served as a member of the Ohio House of Representatives, representing the 86th District.


== Career ==
Prior to government, Daniels and his father managed the Daniels Brothers Farm. Daniels served four years on Greenfield City Council and was Mayor for eight years. He also served as a Highland County Commissioner for six years.
With an open seat available in 2002, Daniels won a three-way primary to take the Republican nomination with 41.85% of the vote.  He defeated Democrat Bill Horne with 63.4% of the vote to take his first term. In 2004, he again defeated Horne with 61.08% of the vote, and again with 53.16% of the vote in 2006. Daniels was selected as Chairman of the State Government and Elections Committee for the 127th General Assembly. In 2008, Daniels again beat Horne with 57.5% of the vote to take a final term.


== Ohio Senate ==
With incumbent John Carey unable to run again in 2010 due to term limits, Daniels entered the race to succeed him.  However, he faced fellow Representative Clyde Evans in the primary election. It proved to be a divisive, negative primary, which included election complaints filed by both candidates. In the end, Daniels defeated Evans with 51.62% of the vote to take the nomination. Daniels faced Gallia County Commissioner Justin Fallon in the general election.  While Democrats were hoping for an upset, Daniels won the general election with 63.39% of the vote.On January 3, 2011, Daniels was sworn into office for his first term.

Fibular collateral ligament,"The lateral collateral ligament (LCL, long external lateral ligament or fibular collateral ligament) is an extrinsic ligament of the knee located on the lateral side of the knee. Its superior attachment is at the lateral epicondyle of the femur (superoposterior to the popliteal groove); its inferior attachment is at the lateral aspect of the head of fibula (anterior to the apex). The LCL is not fused with the joint capsule. Inferiorly, the LCL splits the tendon of insertion of the biceps femoris muscle.


== Structure ==
The LCL measures some 5 cm in length. It is rounded, and is more narrow and less broad compared to the medial collateral ligament. It extends obliquely inferoposteriorly from its superior attachment to its inferior attachment.In contrast to the medial collateral ligament, it is not fused with either the capsular ligament nor the lateral meniscus. Because of this, the LCL is more flexible than its medial counterpart, and is therefore less susceptible to injury.


=== Relations ===
Immediately below its origin is the groove for the tendon of the popliteus.The greater part of its lateral surface is covered by the tendon of the biceps femoris; the tendon, however, divides at its insertion into two parts, which are separated by the ligament.Deep to the ligament are the tendon of the popliteus, and the inferior lateral genicular vessels and nerve.


== Function ==
Both collateral ligaments are taut when the knee joint is in extension.  With the knee in flexion, the radius of curvatures of the condyles is decreased and the origin and insertions of the ligaments are brought closer together which make them lax. The pair of ligaments thus stabilize the knee joint in the coronal plane. Therefore, damage and rupture of these ligaments can be diagnosed by examining the knee's stability in the mediolateral axis.


== Clinical significance ==


=== Causes of injury ===
The LCL is usually injured as a result of varus force across the knee, which is a force pushing the knee from the medial (inner) side of the joint, causing stress on the outside. An example of this would be a direct blow to the inside of the knee. The LCL can also be injured by a noncontact injury, such as a hyperextension stress, again causing varus force across the knee.An LCL injury usually occurs simultaneously as the other ligaments of the knee are injured. Multiple knee ligament tears and stresses can result from a significant trauma that includes direct blunt force to the knee, such as an automobile crash.


=== Symptoms ===
Symptoms of a sprain or tear of the LCL includes pain to the lateral aspect of the knee, instability of the knee when walking, swelling and ecchymosis (bruising) at the site of trauma. Direct trauma to the medial aspect of the knee may also affect the peroneal nerve, which could result in a foot drop or paresthesias  below the knee which could present itself as a tingling sensation.


== Treatment ==
An isolated LCL tear or sprain rarely requires surgery. If the injury is a Grade 1 or Grade II, microscopic or partial macroscopic tearing respectively, the injury is treated with rest and rehabilitation. Ice, electrical stimulation and elevation are all methods to reduce the pain and swelling felt in the initial stages after the injury takes place. Physical therapy focuses on regaining full range-of-motion, such as biking, stretching and careful applications of pressure on the joint. Full recovery of Grade I or Grade II tears should take between 6 weeks and 3 months. Continued pain, swelling and instability to the joint after this time period may require surgical repair or reconstruction to the ligament.

Methodenstreit,"Methodenstreit (German for ""method dispute""), in intellectual history beyond German-language discourse, was an economics controversy commenced in the 1880s and persisting for more than a decade, between that field's Austrian School and the (German) Historical School. The debate concerned the place of general theory in social science and the use of history in explaining the dynamics of human action. It also touched on policy and political issues, including the roles of the individual and state. Nevertheless, methodological concerns were uppermost and some early members of the Austrian School also defended a form of welfare state, as prominently advocated by the Historical School.
When the debate opened, Carl Menger developed the Austrian School's standpoint, and Gustav von Schmoller defended the approach of the Historical School.
(In German-speaking countries, the original of this Germanism is not specific to the one controversy—which is likely to be specified as Methodenstreit der Nationalökonomie, i.e. ""Methodenstreit of economics"".)


== History ==


=== Background ===
The Historical School contended that economists could develop new and better social laws from the collection and study of statistics and historical materials, and distrusted theories not derived from historical experience. Thus, the German Historical School focused on specific dynamic institutions as the largest variable in changes in political economy.  The Historical School were themselves reacting against materialist determinism, the idea that human action could, and would (once science advanced enough), be explained as physical and chemical reactions.The Austrian School, beginning with the work of Carl Menger in the 1860s, argued against this (in Grundsätze der Volkswirtschaftslehre, English title: Principles of Economics), that economics was the work of philosophical logic and could only ever be about developing rules from first principles — seeing human motives and social interaction as far too complex to be amenable to statistical analysis — and purporting to deduce universally valid precepts from human actions.


=== Menger and the German Historical School ===
The first move was when Carl Menger attacked Schmoller and the German Historical School, in his 1883 book Investigations into the Method of the Social Sciences, with Special Reference to Political Economics (Untersuchungen über die Methode der Socialwissenschaften, und der politischen Ökonomie insbesondere). Menger thought the best method of studying economics was through reason and finding general theories which applied to broad areas. Menger, as did the other Austrians, concentrated upon the subjective, atomistic nature of economics. He emphasized the subjective factors. He said the grounds for economics were built upon self-interest, evaluation on the margin, and incomplete knowledge. He said aggregative, collective ideas could not have adequate foundation unless they rested upon individual components.
The direct attack on the German Historical School lead Schmoller to respond quickly with an unfavourable and quite hostile review of Menger's book. Menger accepted the challenge and replied in a passionate pamphlet, written in the form of letters to a friend, in which he (according to Hayek) ""ruthlessly demolished Schmoller's position"". The encounter between the masters was soon imitated by their disciples. A degree of hostility not often equaled in scientific controversy developed.


== Consequences ==
The term ""Austrian school of economics"" came into existence as a result of the Methodenstreit, when Schmoller used it in an unfavourable review of one of Menger's later books, intending to convey an impression of backwardness and obscurantism of Austria compared to the more modern Prussians. A serious consequence of the hostile debate was that Schmoller went so far as to declare publicly that members of the ""abstract"" school were unfit to fill a teaching position in a German university, and his influence was quite sufficient to make this equivalent to a complete exclusion of all adherents to Menger's doctrines from academic positions in Germany. The result was that even thirty years after the close of the controversy Germany was still less affected by the new ideas now spreading elsewhere, than any other academically important country in the world.

Tet 1969,"Tet 1969 refers to the attacks mounted by the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and Viet Cong (VC) in February 1969 in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War, one year after the original Tet Offensive.
Most attacks centered on military targets near Saigon and Da Nang and were quickly beaten off. Some speculate that the attacks were mounted to test the will of the new U.S. President Richard Nixon who retaliated by secretly bombing PAVN/VC sanctuaries in Cambodia the following month.
Numerous bases were attacked, these attacks were all beaten back but did inflict casualties and reinforced the fact that PAVN/VC forces were able to mount attacks at will.


== Long Binh/Bien Hoa ==
Intelligence had indicators of the pending attacks. On 19 February, a defector surrendered to Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) forces and revealed a large VC force would attack key installations in the Saigon area to include Long Binh Post. Unfortunately, the reporting was delayed and did not reach Long Binh until the morning of 22 February 1969, the day the defector warned the attacks were set to begin.

After sundown on the 22nd, elements of the VC 274th Regiment, 5th Division made their final preparations while occupying three hills along Highway 15 approximately three kilometers south of the base. That evening, several ambush squads from the 720th Military Police Battalion, 18th MP Brigade kept watch along potential avenues of approach to Long Binh Post. One of the MP ambush squads held a position within a kilometer of the VC stronghold. At 02:00 on 23 February, the 274th VC Regiment initiated their attack with an estimated 78 rounds of rocket and mortar fire from their positions. The rounds landed on post with some igniting the POL fuel site east of the highway.The VC made several attempts to advance on the base, but were halted. Full-scale sweeping operations to secure the perimeter began just after noon that day. M113 armored personnel carriers and M551 Sheridan armored reconnaissance vehicles supported the forces on the ground while AH-1 Cobra gunships and OH-6 helicopters provided air support. These units made occasional contact, often with PAVN or VC who fought stubbornly from trenches and spider holes.In the early morning hours of 26 February, a force of approximately 400 men from the VC 275th Regiment, 5th Division, had infiltrated into the tiny village of Thai Hiep on the outskirts of Bien Hoa. About 85 per cent of the force was estimated to be PAVN soldiers. At about 03:00, as reconnaissance elements of the unit were observed and engaged by US Air Force security forces at the perimeter of Bien Hoa Air Base, the villagers began to flee their homes, running down streets and creek beds. The villagers met elements of the South Vietnamese 5th Marine Battalion, the 3rd Battalion, 48th Infantry Regiment, 18th Division and the 3rd Squadron, 5th Armored Cavalry moving on the road less than a half mile from Thai Hiep in response to the contact at the air base. The villagers told the ARVN forces how they were driven out of their homes and confined to an area near a creek running alongside the village. At that time, the air base security forces reported that they had lost contact with the enemy reconnaissance element which withdrew east toward Thai Hiep. The ARVN units swiftly moved into blocking positions, and by daybreak, the PAVN/VC were surrounded. Additional South Vietnamese Regional Force elements moved in and the ARVN troops continued to contain the PAVN/VC forces until 11:00 when assault forces, in the form of the ARVN 36th Ranger Battalion, reinforced the contact. By 15:00 the 36th Ranger Battalion moved into the village attacking the PAVN/VC force. The series of assaults met heavy resistance by the battalion of PAVN who had turned the villagers sandbagged shelters into a series of well-fortified defensive positions. ARVN psychological operations units broadcast repeated loud-speaker appeals and warnings, and all of the remaining villagers and several wounded PAVN/VC evacuated out of Thai Riep. Just after 16:00 US Air Force F-100s and F-4s along with Republic of Vietnam Air Force A-1 Skyraiders were directed against the PAVN/VC positions in the village. Following the employment of the supporting fires, the 36th Ranger Battalion moved back into the village. The Rangers met only slight, disorganized resistance. By 01:00 the next morning, the bodies of 264 PAVN/VC soldiers lay in the village, and 87 had been captured or surrendered. More than 100 individual and crew-served weapons were captured. ARVN casualties were 10 killed and 100 wounded and one US Army photographer was killed. The prisoners revealed that their mission had been to attack Bien Hoa city and the Bien Hoa Air Base.


== Da Nang ==
Since early February 1969, the 1st Marine Division had noted an upsurge in PAVN/VC activity around Da Nang. On 7 February Company D, 1st Battalion, 26th Marines found a PAVN/VC base area near the Nam O bridge northwest of the Red Beach Base Area, leaving the base untouched, they returned at night setting up a series of ambushes that killed 18 PAVN and captured 2. On 8 February patrols from 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines found 7 122mm rockets 14 km southwest of Da Nang and another 13 140mm rockets 2 km further south. On 18 February a Company F, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines called in artillery fire on a group of PAVN/VC 5 km south of Marble Mountain resulting in 21 secondary explosions believed to be from detonating rockets. Also in mid-February Company D, 1st Battalion, 7th Marines engaged an entrenched PAVN platoon 22 km southwest of Da Nang killing 30 and the ARVN 2nd Battalion, 51st Regiment operating 4 km west of the Marines killed 49 PAVN moving north of Go Noi Island.: 97 After midnight on 23 February Company K, 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines and Company D, 1st Military Police Battalion detected VC approaching the Song Cau Do river bridges and attacked them killing 47 and capturing 11. A 70-strong VC force attacked the 2/1 Marines command post 6 km south of Marble Mountain losing 17 dead.: 99 To the west of Da Nang, shortly after midnight on the 23rd Company M, 3/7 Marines ambushed a PAVN force killing 10 and later that night a larger force was spotted and artillery fire was called in. On searching the site at dawn it was found that 2 PAVN 81mm mortar teams had been destroyed in the barrage.: 99 Before dawn on 23 February, the first day of Tết, the PAVN/VC fired 25 122mm rockets at Da Nang's deep water port hitting an ARVN ammunition dump and a fuel tank farm at Da Nang Air Base and cause minor damage to an A-6A and 6 helicopters at the Air Base.: 97  Later that day rockets hit the An Hoa Combat Base destroying 15,000 rounds of artillery ammunition and igniting 40,000 gallons of aviation fuel and 50 rockets were fired at Naval Support Activity Da Nang with more than half going into the sea and the remainder causing minor damage.: 98 At dawn PAVN sappers attacked the 1st Marine Division headquarters on Hill 327 and the 2/7 Marines command post to the northwest. These attacks were repulsed for Marines losses of 18 killed and more than 75 PAVN killed.: 100 After dawn on 23 February a VC unit was detected near the Hòa Vang District and the Marine security force killed 6 and captured 2 and forced the rest of the unit to retreat into a cemetery where they were attacked by the ARVN 21st Ranger Battalion the next day losing a further 57 killed.: 99 Meanwhile to the west 3/7 Marines continued to engage PAVN forces, forcing them into 3 pockets along the Song Tuy Loan river. Two of the pockets were destroyed by the next morning resulting in the capture of the acting commander of the 141st Regiment. The last pocket along the An Tan ridgeline proved more difficult and Company L, 3/7 Marines suffered numerous casualties forcing it to withdraw. On the morning of 26 February following Napalm and Snake Eye air strikes, Company L, reinforced by Company M assaulted the PAVN position making slow progress against determined PAVN resistance. The attack continued into 27 February when the Marines overran the PAVN resulting in a total of more than 200 killed.: 99–100 PAVN/VC retreating to the south from Da Nang were intercepted by elements of the 1st Marine Regiment and ARVN 1st Battalion, 51st Regiment 11 km south of Da Nang losing 139 dead in 3 days of fighting.: 99 The PAVN/VC attacks on Da Nang were a failure resulting in more than 500 dead.: 101

Myrmecoris gracilis,"Myrmecoris gracilis is a species of flightless Hemipteran bug from the family Miridae. The genus  Mymecoris  is monotypic with one Palaearctic species. It differs in its outward appearance and way of life from other ""grass bugs"" in the Stenodemini, being predatory and an effective ant mimic.


== Description ==
The bugs are four to six millimeters long. The adult insects resemble ants of the genus Formica, the larvae dark Lasius ant species.
They are often found together with ants, to which they have a convincing but superficial resemblance. The long rostrum is held inconspicuously beneath the head.The bugs suck plant juices, but feed mainly on aphids, other small insects and insect eggs, sometimes on honeydew, unlike other ""grass bugs"" (Stenodemini) which are exclusively herbivorous. The larvae hatch in May. The adults can be found from early June to early August. There is one generation a year. The overwintering eggs are buried in older blades of grass. Both sexes are usually flightless but some winged individuals occur.The generic name is from Greek myrmex, ant, and koris, beetle or bug. The specific name is the Latin for slender or graceful.


== Distribution and habitat ==
Myrmecoris gracilis  is found across the whole of northern and central Europe, as well as the western part of the northern Mediterranean. To the east it is common in Siberia, China and Korea. The bug lives on dry and warm to moderately damp, grassy open habitats. The adults can be seen climbing on grasses and herbaceous plants in cool damp weather.The species was formerly classed by the IUCN as ""Rare"" in its pre-1994 system; in the UK, the species had been recorded in 15 ten-kilometre squares or fewer at that time. It is described as a ""not common"" inhabitant of dry heathland in Britain, where it is confined to the far south of England in an area bounded by Exeter, Bristol, Oxford, Luton and Eastbourne. In the Avon Gorge it forms 11.1% of the insect visitors to Trinia glauca.

International League Hall of Fame,"The International League Hall of Fame is an American baseball hall of fame which honors players, managers, and executives of the International League (IL). It was created by the International League Baseball Writers' Association in 1947 to honor those individuals who made significant contributions to the league. 
The Hall of Fame inducted its first class of nine former players, managers, and league officials in 1947. A plaque was unveiled at the IL's New York City offices located in the Ruppert Building at 535 Fifth Avenue. Today, the plaque has no permanent home, but exists as a traveling display which visits a number of the league's ballparks each season.From 1949 through 1960, the league inducted up to three new members each year. Only one member was inducted annually from 1961 to 1963. After the cessation of the league's Baseball Writers' Association, the Hall of Fame became dormant from 1964 to 2006. The Hall was reestablished in 2007 to commemorate the League's 125th season of play in 2008. Two new members were inducted in 2007, and plans were made to elect up to 28, 14, and 7 inductees, respectively, over the next three years. Since 2011, up to three inductees have been voted into the Hall annually. As of 2020, 129 individuals have been inducted into the International League Hall of Fame.

Alderwood School,"Alderwood School is a coeducational all-through school located over three sites in Aldershot in Hampshire, England. It was formed in September 2017 from the merger of Belle Vue Infant School, Newport Junior School and The Connaught School.


== History ==
The secondary department of the school started life as Heron Wood County Secondary School for Boys in 1963. In 1987, with the closure of the nearby Manor Park Girls' School, it became coeducational and was renamed The Connaught School.
In 2011 The Connaught School, in partnership with Aldershot Town FC won the National LiteracyActionNet Award for Double Club, an after-school provision for pupils and parents that teaches skills in both Literacy and Sport.
In June 2013 an Ofsted inspection was made of English and Literacy across The Connaught School, the outcome of which was ‘Good’ with outstanding features. Ofsted remarked on the “excellent provision” for pupils and also on “commitment across the curriculum” to raising standards. It was also noted in the report that “pupils across the school are making good progress.” A further Ofsted inspection of the school in 2015 rated it as ""Requires Improvement"". Recent years have seen a large increase in the numbers of students with English as an additional language (EAL) with 30% of students being EAL in 2019 compared to a national average of 16.9%.
In 2017, as a result of these Ofsted reports and considering that The Connaught School had ""performed relatively weakly on attainment measures for the previous three years"" (in 2015 29% of students attained 5 good GCSEs including English and mathematics compared to a national average of 57% placing the school well below the minimum Government Floor Standard of 40%) Hampshire County Council decided to merge The Connaught School with the Federation of Newport Junior School and Belle Vue Infant School from September 2017, to create a single all-through (age 4 to 16) school to collectively be called Alderwood School. A further Ofsted inspection across all three sites in January 2020 rated the school as ""Good"".
In 2018 Young Sherlock Holmes author Andrew Lane gave a talk to students at the school while in 2019 the actor Gerald Charles Dickens, the great-great grandson of Charles Dickens, performed his one-man show of A Christmas Carol in the school hall. Dickens returned to the school to give a repeat performance in October 2021. The author Tom Palmer visited the school in May 2023.


== Today ==
Recent visits in support of learning include: the Natural History Museum; the Imperial War Museum;  the Old Operating Theatre Museum and St Thomas' Hospital; Portsmouth Dockyard, the Mary Rose and HMS Victory while theatre trips include Romeo and Juliet at Shakespeare's Globe, The Tempest and An Inspector Calls at the Mayflower Theatre in Southampton. In addition, the Physical Education department organises an annual sporting tour of Europe during which students play matches against local teams while at the same time experiencing local culture and customs.
Students at the secondary school are involved in an annual performance in the school hall. These include the musicals School of Rock (2018), The Addams Family (2019), Grease (2020)  Hairspray (2022) and Sister Act (2023).
Alderwood School is a partner school of the Sixth Form College in nearby Farnborough. Since 2018 the school has been home to Aldershot Town F.C. Academy which has the use of classrooms in the school in addition to the 24-hour astroturf and gymnasium.


== Houses ==
Until the summer of 2021 pupils were affiliated to one of four houses:

Marlborough
Montgomery
Stanhope
WellingtonGiven the town's strong military connection, the houses were named after former barracks in Aldershot which in turn were named after great military leaders and a Secretary of State for War.
In 2021 the houses were renamed to reflect a more inclusive range of historical figures:

Northern short-tailed shrew,"The northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda) is the largest shrew in the genus Blarina, and occurs in the northeastern region of North America. It is a semifossorial, highly active, and voracious insectivore and is present in a variety of habitats like broadleaved and pine forests among shrubs and hedges as well as grassy river banks. It is notable in that it is one of the few venomous mammals. The specific epithet, brevicauda, is a combination of the Latin brevis and cauda, meaning ""short tail"".


== Taxonomy ==
B. brevicauda is a red-toothed shrew, one of three or four species (depending on the authority) in the genus Blarina. It was formerly considered to be a sister subspecies of the southern short-tailed shrew (B. carolinensis). The species has been divided into 11 subspecies based on morphological characteristics, which are grouped into two semispecies: B. b. brevicauda and B. b. talpoides; these groupings were mirrored by a molecular systematics study of the mitochondrial cytochrome b sequence. The two groups of subspecies are thought to have been kept isolated from each other by Pleistocene glaciers.


== Description ==
This shrew has a total length of 108 to 140 mm (4.3 to 5.5 in), of which 18 to 32 mm (0.71 to 1.26 in) is tail; and weighs 15 to 30 g (0.53 to 1.06 oz). The species exhibits slight sexual dimorphism in size, with the male being slightly larger than the female. The dorsal fur is thick and velvety, and can be black, brownish black, or silvery gray, with the ventral fur being a bit lighter and grayer. The shrew molts from a summer coat which is shorter and paler than the winter pelage in October and November, and back again sometime in February through July. The tail is quite short, amounting to less than 25% of the total length. The dental formula is I 3-3/1-1, C 1-1/1-1, P 3-3/1-1, M 3-3/3-3 = 16/16 = 32. Three well-developed scent glands are present, one on each side of the animal and one ventral; the scent may be used for marking territories, though the shrew's sense of smell is thought to be poor.


== Distribution ==


=== Fossil record ===
Most records of B. brevicauda are from the Pleistocene, though one record from the late Pliocene (Blancan land mammal age) is tentatively attributed to this species. Another source indicates the earliest record of the genus Blarina is a specimen of B. b. talpoides, from the Blancan (early Pleistocene) in Kansas. The species is thought to have arisen in the middle or late Pliocene. The B. b. brevicauda subspecies appeared later.


=== Range ===
This shrew is found throughout central and eastern North America, from southern Saskatchewan to Atlantic Canada and south to northern Arkansas and Georgia. It is probably the most common shrew in the Great Lakes region. Population densities usually range from five to 30 shrews per hectare (two to 12 per acre), but rarely exceed 200/ha (80/ac). The typical home range of a shrew is 2.5 ha, and may overlap slightly with the ranges of other shrews.


=== Habitat ===
Both disturbed and undisturbed habitats are used by the northern short-tailed shrew, including grasslands, old fields, fencerows, marshy areas, deciduous and coniferous forests, and household gardens, though the preferred habitats are those which are moist with leaf litter or thick plant cover. Burned-over forests are not quickly recolonized by B. brevicauda, and shrews quickly depart clear-cuts.


== Diet ==
This shrew consumes up to three times its weight in food each day. It eats small quantities of subterranean fungi and seeds, though it is mostly carnivorous. It prefers insects, earthworms, voles, snails, and other shrews for the bulk of its diet, though salamanders and mice are also eaten. This shrew consumes vertebrates more often than other shrews do. The shrew mostly forages within a few hours after sunset, though it is also active during cloudy days. High evaporative water loss requires the shrew to have access to a source of water, though it does obtain water from its food, as well. The shrew often hoards food, especially in the fall and winter, or during a time of prey abundance; one study found it caches 87% of the prey it catches, while 9% is eaten immediately and 4% is left where it was killed.


=== Toxin ===
The saliva of the northern short-tailed shrew contains a kallikrein-like protease, used to paralyze and subdue its prey. The toxin is strong enough to kill small animals, up to sizes somewhat larger than the shrew itself, and results in painful bites to humans who attempt to handle the shrew. The venomous saliva is secreted from submaxillary glands, through a duct which opens at the base of the lower incisors, where the saliva flows along the groove formed by the two incisors, and into the prey. The toxin is very similar in structure to the one produced by the Mexican beaded lizard (Heloderma horridum) which independently developed its toxin from the same precursor protein.


== Physiology ==


=== Senses ===
Their sense of smell is thought to be poor, and their eyes are degenerated and vision is thought to be limited to the detection of light, but the shrew compensates by using echolocation and a fine sense of touch.


=== Energetics ===
Its ability to consume almost anything it can catch allows the northern short-tailed shrew to survive the cold winters of temperate regions. The thermoneutral zone of this species is from 25 to 33 °C, meaning no extra energy must be expended by the animal to maintain its body temperature (which averages 38.0–38.5 °C) when the ambient temperature is within this range. Food consumption is 43% higher in winter than in summer, as the shrew must increase its metabolic rate to maintain its body temperature under the cold conditions. Temperatures at or above 35 °C are lethal for this shrew. A study of captive shrews found, though they were primarily nocturnal, the degree of nocturnality changed with the season; that is, during the colder winter, the shrews exhibited more out-of-burrow activity earlier in the evening, but were active later in the night during the summer. This seasonal pattern was due to solar radiation and changing daily temperatures, and it allows the shrews to minimize the energy needed for thermoregulation. Other winter adaptations include the creation of a lined nest which aids the shrew in conserving heat, the caching of food in case of prey shortages, foraging below the leaf litter or snow where the temperature is milder, and decreasing activity levels during cold periods. Along with these behavioral adaptations, the northern short-tailed shrew increases its ability to generate body heat during the winter by nonshivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue.


== Behavior ==
Other shrews spend more time above ground than does the northern short-tailed shrew, which prefers to tunnel along below ground, through the leaf litter, or at the snow/ground interface. Bouts of frenzied activity, lasting around five minutes, are followed by longer periods of resting, with the total active time amounting to only 16% of a 24-hour day. This animal is capable of digging at a rate of 2.5 cm/min, in between resting.The shrew constructs a nest up to 20 cm (8 in) in diameter underground or underneath a log, and lines it with leaves or the fur of the meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus). This nest is kept clean, with wastes deposited outside the nest in a latrine area. Other parts of the burrow system are used for food storage.Typically solitary, B. brevicauda exhibits several aggressive displays and vocalizations to ward off other members of the species when encounters occur. Pairs of shrews which were introduced to a cage simultaneously coexisted for less than four months before one killed the other, and a new shrew placed in a cage containing an already established shrew will be killed within a few hours.


== Reproduction ==
Mating occurs from March through September, though most births occur early or late in that period. Male shrews in captivity were observed to make clicking sounds while courting a female. During copulation, the male and female are locked together, and the female drags the male along with her. Gestation lasts 21–24 days, and after birth, the six to eight young are suckled for up to 25 days before the babies are weaned. Two litters per season are typical, though three are possible. The female strengthens the nest when the young are nursing, and is more active to support her increased nutritional needs. The young, which were born hairless and blind and weighing less than a gram, may become sexually mature in as soon as 2–3 months; those born in the spring mature more quickly than those born late in the season, and may themselves reproduce in the same year they were born. The juvenile pelage is pale and quite similar to the adults' summer fur, and is molted when the young reaches adult size.


== Predation ==
The northern short-tailed shrew has a high mortality rate, though it attempts to escape predation by remaining hidden under vegetation, soil, leaf litter, or snow; only 6% of a marked group of shrews survived to the next year, and winter mortality of 90% has been recorded, probably due to cold stress. This shrew is consumed by many predators: trout, snakes, raptors, canids, cats, mustelids, skunks, raccoons, and opossums, though mammalian carnivores appear to be deterred by the musky odor produced by the shrew's scent glands.


== Conservation ==
The northern short-tailed shrew is considered a species of least concern in the IUCN Red List, as it is widespread, abundant, and its population is not declining.


== Relationship with humans ==
Northern short-tailed shrews cannot be domesticated.

Henry was a product of the Stoke City academy who went on to make over 120 appearances for the club, also spending time on loan at Cheltenham Town in 2004. He joined his hometown club Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2006, and went on to become captain of the side in the Premier League. Henry spent seven seasons at Wolves, making 272 appearances in all competitions.
He joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 and helped them to victory in the 2014 Championship play-off final. In 2017, after four years with QPR, he was released from the club upon the expiry of his contract; he later played for Bolton Wanderers and Bradford City before retiring in 2019.


== Club career ==


=== Stoke City ===
Born in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, Henry began his career as a youth player for Stoke City in 1998. He made his first team debut on 7 February 2001 in a 4–0 Football League Trophy victory against Walsall. He broke into the first team under Gudjon Thordarson in 2001–02 making 28 appearances as Stoke gained promotion via the play-offs. Henry went on again to feature regularly for Stoke in the 2002–03 season making 22 appearances as Stoke narrowly avoided relegation. He scored his first and only goal for Stoke in a 4–2 defeat against Bradford City on 26 December 2002. This saw him selected for the England under 18, 20 and 21 squads.Henry was unable to hold down a regular starting role in the 2003–04 season and was loaned out to Third Division side Cheltenham Town on a two-month deal in January 2004. Henry played nine times for the Robins scoring once against Mansfield Town. Henry came back into the first team following his loan spell and at the end of the season he signed a new contract.The 2004–05 and 2005–06 seasons saw Henry play a bit part role for Stoke mainly being used as a substitute. He made 15 starts for Stoke in each season and overall made a total of 34 substitute appearances.In the summer of the 2006–07 season Henry was out of contract, and although officially a free agent, was still training with Stoke City. The club allowed him to go on trial at Wolverhampton Wanderers, who he joined permanently in August 2006 for a fee of £100,000.


=== Wolverhampton Wanderers ===
Henry joined his hometown club on a three-year contract in August 2006 a week before the start of the 2006–07 season. He made his Wolverhampton Wanderers debut and his first start for his new club against Plymouth Argyle on the opening day of the season. Henry spent most of his first season filling in at right back and playing a few games in central midfield.
He was appointed captain for the first time in December 2006 as Jody Craddock was out injured. Henry's first season for Wolves came to an end when he suffered a serious injury in the game against Luton Town on 3 March 2007. Henry bruised his spleen and was forced to sit out the remainder of the 2006–07 season, which saw him miss out on the Championship play-offs. He made a total of 34 appearances in his first season for Wolves, scoring three goals.
In the 2007–08 season, Henry again impressed for Wolves after holding down his position in the centre of midfield. He went on to make a total of 42 appearances for Wolves, scoring three goals again. These goals came against Preston North End and two against Charlton Athletic, both home and away. Henry also picked up an injury against Charlton on 29 March 2008, which saw him miss the last six games of the season.
The 2008–09 season saw Henry impress again for Wolves and he was also handed the captain's armband for the majority of the season as Jody Craddock was out injured. He was an integral part of the team which made an impressive start to the season as Wolves were at the top of the table for numerous months with Henry captaining them. He was in the starting 11 against Queens Park Rangers in which Wolves went on to win the game which resulted in them gaining promotion to the Premier League. On 3 May 2009, Henry and Craddock both lifted the Championship trophy at Molineux on the final day of the season after their 1–0 over Doncaster Rovers.
Henry was an ever-present captain in the Wolves team in the 2009–10 season, his Premier League debut came against West Ham United on the opening day. He went on to make 34 appearances for Wolves during 2009–10, missing only four games, as Wolves stayed up at the end of their first season in the Premier League.
During the 2010–11 season, Henry made 31 Premier League appearances as captain. On the last day of the season, on 22 May 2011, Wolverhampton Wanderers stayed in the Premier League after finishing 17th.
A start of the new season, new signing Roger Johnson replaced Henry as club captain. Henry started Wolves' first three games in the 2011–12 season, including the 0–0 draw away at local rivals Aston Villa. Before the match between QPR and Wolves, Henry threw down the gauntlet on Joey Barton as they prepared to go head-to-head at Molineux. The two (both Joey Barton and Karl Henry) were involved in a physical confrontation in August 2010 when Barton was still at Newcastle. The confrontation occurred after Henry made a number of strong tackles on Barton. During the match between QPR and Wolves, which QPR won 3–0, Henry continued his strong challenges on Barton, who hit back by making claims that Henry 'tries to hurt people'. Henry says Barton was 'embarrassing' after recent comments. Henry was taunted by a section of the Molineux crowd after being substituted, when Wolves were defeated by Newcastle United by a score of 1–2. He was defended by Wolves captain at the time, Roger Johnson.With the arrival of Kenny Jackett as manager, Henry was transfer listed, despite his contract still having three more years to run.


=== Queens Park Rangers ===
Henry signed for Championship side Queens Park Rangers on 23 July 2013 for an undisclosed fee. He scored his first goal for the club against future employers Bolton Wanderers on 28 January 2014.

Zeka Buljubaša,"Jovan Gligorijević (Serbian Cyrillic: Јован Глигоријевић, ca. 1785–1813), known as Zeka Buljubaša (Зека Буљубаша), was a Serbian revolutionary captain (buljubaša) and nobleman active during the First Serbian Uprising.


== Early life ==
Gligorijević was born in ca. 1785, in Sjenica. His family hailed from Nevesinje. He was brought up working for Serb and Turkish merchants, from where he learnt to ride horses, use weapons, and the Turkish language. He went to school in a monastery. His parents called him zeka (rabbit) due to his green eyes.Zeka came to the Sanjak of Smederevo due to the outbreak of the First Serbian Uprising. Prior to the uprising, he lived in Višegrad. A story goes that he left his home village after falling out with his close friend, a Turk from Nevesinje, after telling him about murdering a Turk man who was about to rape a Serb widow, his neighbour; the friend told Zeka that his Islamic faith could not look over this, and suggested a gun duel; Zeka shot him in the shoulder and immediately left his home for Višegrad. He was not yet 20 years old at that time.


== Career ==

At first, Zeka served in the company of Duke Stojan Čupić in Mačva, then served as border protection by the Drina (towards the Bosnia Eyalet). He was usually posted in Parašnica near Crna Bara.Zeka formed a company of 50–200 men, called the Goli Sinovi (""Naked Sons"", a term for people without wives and children), or Golaći. Although implying poverty, the soldiers were later richly dressed and armed. Zeka and his company also participated in great battles, such as Lešnica and Loznica, but especially successfully watched Turkish movements and intercepted troops. After receiving the rank of buljubaša/captain he became known by the people as ""Zeka Buljubaša"".He commanded a company of volunteers, who were sometimes dressed in broadcloth, though armed with the most beautiful weapons. In 1813, he commanded a brigade (800-1000 soldiers) in the last battle of First Serbian Uprising, Battle of Ravanj. When the brigade's ammunition ran out, they rushed the Ottomans with knives and were all killed, near Zasavica.


== Legacy ==
Dušan Baranin wrote two novels on his life, Zeko Buljubaša (1954) and Golaći (1966). A football club in Ravnje bears his name.
In the novel Hajduk Stanko by Janko Veselinović, Zeka Buljubaša is one of the main characters. 
Also, his descendants are Savkić family, named after his brother Savko .

Transition town,"The terms transition town, transition initiative and transition model refer to grassroot community projects that aim to increase self-sufficiency to reduce the potential effects of peak oil, climate destruction, and economic instability through renewed localization strategies, especially around food production and energy usage. In 2006, the founding of Transition Town Totnes in the United Kingdom became an inspiration for other groups to form. The Transition Network charity was founded in early 2007, to support these projects. A number of the groups are officially registered with the Transition Network. Transition initiatives have been started in locations around the world, with many located in the United Kingdom and others in Europe, North America and Australia. While the aims remain the same, Transition initiatives' solutions are specific depending on the characteristics of the local area.


== Etymology ==
The term, ""transition town"" was coined by Louise Rooney and Catherine Dunne.
The transition model can be applied to different types of places where people live, such as villages, regions, islands and towns. The generic term is ""transition initiative"", which includes transition neighborhoods, communities, and cities, although ""transition town"" is in common usage.


== History ==


=== From Kinsale to Totnes ===
In 2004, permaculture designer Rob Hopkins set his students at Kinsale Further Education College the task of applying permaculture principles to the concept of peak oil. The output of this student project was the ‘Kinsale Energy Descent Action Plan'.This looked at across-the-board creative adaptations in the realms of energy production, health, education, economy and agriculture as a ""road map"" to a sustainable future for the town. Two of his students, Louise Rooney and Catherine Dunne, developed the Transition towns concept.  They then presented their ideas to Kinsale Town Council, to which the councilors decided to adopt the plan and work towards energy independence.Hopkins moved to his hometown of Totnes, England, where he and Naresh Giangrande developed these concepts into the transition model.  In early 2006, Transition Town Totnes was founded and became the inspiration for the founding of other Transition initiatives.


=== Transition Network founded ===
In early 2007, the Transition Network UK charity was co-founded by permaculture educator Rob Hopkins, Peter Lipman and Ben Brangwyn. Totnes based, it was initiated to support the Transition initiatives emerging around the world. It trains and supports people involved with the initiatives as well as disseminating the concepts of transition towns.


=== 2008 to present day ===
In 2008, the number of communities involved in the project had increased with many localities in the process of becoming ""official"" Transition towns. This was also the year that the Transition Handbook was published.The initiative spread and by May 2010 there were over 400 community initiatives recognized as official Transition towns in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Italy and Chile. The term transition initiatives became common to reflect the range and type of communities involved – e.g. villages (Kinsale), neighbourhoods of cities (Portobello, Edinburgh), through council districts (Penwith) to cities and city boroughs (Brixton).By September 2013, there were 1130 initiatives registered (462 Official, 654 Muller) in 43 countries.


== Influences ==
Influences include permaculture concepts as described in Bill Mollison’s Permaculture, a Designers Manual (1988) and David Holmgren’s Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability (2003), as well as David Fleming's work on community, culture and resilience.


== Organization ==
Each transition town or initiative has a high level of autonomy. However, to be called an official initiative certain criteria must be met. Additionally, there is nothing to stop an 'unofficial' initiative using ideas inspired by Transition towns. Further, there are various 'hubs' to coordinate work at a regional level.


=== Transition Network ===
The Transition Network (TN) is a UK charity set up to support Transition initiatives. It has published books and films, trained people and facilitated networking. The TN's website contains a listing of the initiatives that have registered, some of which are officially recognised.Some of the material has been translated and adapted to other languages/cultures, including Portuguese, Danish, German, Dutch, Spanish, French, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese and Irish.TN has run seven conferences: Nailsworth (2007), Royal Agriculture College, Cirencester (2008), Battersea Arts Centre (2009), Dame Hannah's at Seale Hayne (2010), Hope University, Liverpool (2011), Battersea Arts Centre (2012) and Dame Hannah's at Seale Hayne (2015).


=== Transition US ===
In the United States, transition initiatives have been started in many communities. Transition US is the national hub with a stated vision, ""that every community in the United States will have engaged its collective creativity to unleash an extraordinary and historic transition to a future beyond fossil fuels; a future that is more vibrant, abundant and resilient; one that is ultimately preferable to the present"".The stated aim of Transition US is to be a resource and ""catalyst for building resilient communities across the United States that are able to withstand severe energy, climate, or economic shocks while creating a better quality of life in the process"". They plan to accomplish this by ""inspiring, encouraging, supporting, networking and training individuals and their communities as they consider, adopt, adapt, and implement the transition approach to community empowerment and change"".A large number of state sites have also been set up using the Ning social networking platform. These state sites, under the umbrella of a national Ning site, were set up to help facilitate, network, inform, monitor, and house regional and organizational transition initiatives.  Thus, furthering the spread of the transition movement while networking related organizations, projects, ideas and activities.


=== Guidance for new groups ===
Some projects use the TN's guide the '12 ingredients', or the 'revised ingredients', when setting up their group.


== Features ==
The Transition Network's (TN) stated aim is to promote awareness of sustainable living and building local ecological resilience.


=== Peak oil and local resilience ===
The Transition Handbook: From Oil Dependency to Local Resiliency by Rob Hopkins provides much of the framework behind the Transition Initiative and outlines ways for local Transition Towns to get involved.


=== Transportation ===

Communities are encouraged by The Transition Network to seek out methods for reducing energy usage as well as reducing their reliance on long supply chains that are totally dependent on fossil fuels for essential items (see environmental calculator).


=== Food production ===
According to The Transition food is a key area for transition, sometimes the slogan ""Food feet, not food miles"" is used. Initiatives so far have included creating community gardens or replacing ornamental tree plantings with fruit or nut trees to grow food.


=== Waste and recycling ===
Business waste exchange seeks to match the waste of one industry with another industry that uses that waste material, sometimes referred to as industrial symbiosis. It is suggested that this process can help companies increase profitability by reducing raw material and waste disposal cost, reducing carbon emission, making their by-products a source of revenue to be bought by other business. It also suggests that repairing old items rather than throwing them away should be considered.


=== Psychology ===
The Transition Network proposes an alternative from business as usual, or from 'shocked/doomladen' reactions to peak oil and an end to unlimited economic growth. According to Southend-on-Sea in Transition,

by shifting our mind-set we can actually recognise the coming post-cheap oil era as an opportunity rather than a threat, and design the future low carbon age to be thriving, resilient and abundant — somewhere much better to live than our current alienated consumer culture based on greed, war and the myth of perpetual growth.""A theme of the Transition Network is acknowledging the emotional impact of changing to a low energy world. Some Transition Network groups have 'Heart and Soul' groups to look at this aspect.


=== Energy descent action plans (EDAP) ===

Transition towns aim  to reduce dependency on fossil fuels, and one way they do this is by developing a community Energy descent action plan (EDAP). As shown in the case of Totnes, the term ""community"" is broadly defined to include local people, local institutions, local agencies and the local council.  Development of an EDAP requires the active engagement of local initiatives at a variety of levels. The first comprehensive plan was created for Totnes in 2010, entitled Transition in Action: Totnes & District 2030.In France, where the movement is called Villes et Territoires en Transition, the association négaWatt provides a theoretical support to the transition movement.


=== Economics ===

After the 2008 global financial crisis, the Transition Network added financial instability as further threat to local communities (alongside peak oil and climate change). It suggested a number of strategies could help, including fiscal localism and local food production. Further, it saw the creation of local complementary currencies as reinforcing moves toward sustainable low carbon economies as well as being socially beneficial. Additionally, Hopkins also wrote that the movement does have an understanding of global economics and is critical of its systemic problems such as being ""growth-based"".Some transition towns have been involved in launching local currencies including the Totnes pound, the Lewes pound, the Stroud pound and the Brixton pound.
To help further these aims the Transition Network setup the REconomy Project, circa 2012.Launched in 2007, the Totnes pound, which was redeemable in local shops and businesses, helped to reduce food miles while also supporting local firms.In 2008, the idea was also considered by three Welsh transition towns, including Cardiff.The Stroud pound and Totnes pound became defunct in 2013 and 2019 respectively. As of November 2019, the Lewes pound and Brixton pound are active.


== In popular culture ==
Transition towns have been featured in the plot line of the long-running BBC Radio 4 series The Archers. This is an example of mainstream media attention the movement received a few years after being founded.


== Publications ==


=== Books ===
A number of books have been published on specific topics, including: how communities can develop their Transition town initiative. Unless stated, the following books were published as a collaboration between Green Books and the Transition Network (under the label Transition Books):
The Transition Handbook: from oil dependency to local resilience (2008) – by Rob Hopkins

The Power of Just Doing Stuff (2013) – by Rob HopkinsIn 2008, the Transition Handbook was the joint 5th most popular book taken on holiday during the summer recess by the UK parliamentary MPs.


=== Films ===
Two films have been created by the movement about the movement. They document the progress of various initiatives:

In Transition 1.0 (2009)
In Transition 2.0 (2012) Emma Goude (Director), Transition Network and Green Lane Films (Production)


== Critique and research ==
In 2008, the Trapese Collective published a critique called The Rocky Road to a Real Transition to which Hopkins replied. The debate was partly about how social change is brought about.A number of academic papers have been published looking at the concept's progress:

As the museum describes in its mission statement, it recognizes other people, events, and actions which furthered America's Right to Vote since ""the Founding Fathers first planted the seeds of democracy in 1776."" The museum was founded by Faya Ora Rose Touré and Marie Foster.It is located near the Edmund Pettus Bridge. On this bridge on March 7, 1965, voting rights marchers who left the city for a planned walk to Montgomery were beaten and clubbed by Dallas County posse and Alabama State Troopers, in what became known as ""Bloody Sunday"". They had passed into the county on a planned walk of 54 miles to Montgomery, Alabama's state capital. This treatment was nationally televised and covered by major media, arousing national outrage. After gaining federal protection from President Lyndon B. Johnson and a federal court order protecting their right to march, thousands of people left Selma on March 21, reaching Montgomery several days later. By then, they had been joined by thousands more, black and white, and 25,000 marchers entered the state capital to press for protection of constitutional voting rights. Later that summer the Voting Rights Act of 1965, introduced by the Johnson administration, was passed by Congress and signed by the president. 


== Exhibits ==
The museum's several rooms and exhibit areas include the ""Footprints to Freedom"" room, which features molded cast-footprints of some of the activists who participated in the Selma to Montgomery marches; a ""Women's Suffrage Room"", honoring the contributions of African-American and other women who secured women's voting rights in the U.S.; the ""Selma Room"", also known as the ""Marie Foster"" room, where voting records, clothes worn by people beaten during the march, and other artifacts of these social movements are displayed; and a room where people who participated in the 1960s marches can leave personal messages and chronicle their memories. The museum also features a large blow-up of a portion of an iconic photograph taken on the Selma to Montgomery march by Look magazine photographer James Karales.

Antigen presentation,"Antigen presentation is a vital immune process that is essential for T cell immune response triggering. Because T cells recognize only fragmented antigens displayed on cell surfaces, antigen processing must occur before the antigen fragment can be recognized by a T-cell receptor. Specifically, the fragment, bound to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), is transported to the surface of the cell, a process known as presentation. If there has been an infection with viruses or bacteria, the cell will present an endogenous or exogenous peptide fragment derived from the antigen by MHC molecules. There are two types of MHC molecules which differ in the behaviour of the antigens: MHC class I molecules (MHC-I) bind peptides from the cell cytosol, while peptides generated in the endocytic vesicles after internalisation are bound to MHC class II (MHC-II). Cellular membranes separate these two cellular environments - intracellular and extracellular. Each T cell can only recognize tens to hundreds of copies of a unique sequence of a single peptide among thousands of other peptides presented on the same cell, because an MHC molecule in one cell can bind to quite a large range of peptides. Predicting which (fragments of) antigens will be presented to the immune system by a certain MHC/HLA type is difficult, but the technology involved is improving.


== Presentation of intracellular antigens: Class I ==
Cytotoxic T cells (also known as Tc, killer T cell, or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)) express CD8 co-receptors and are a population of T cells that are specialized for inducing programmed cell death of other cells. Cytotoxic T cells regularly patrol all body cells to maintain the organismal homeostasis. Whenever they encounter signs of disease, caused for example by the presence of viruses or intracellular bacteria or a transformed tumor cell, they initiate processes to destroy the potentially harmful cell. All nucleated cells in the body (along with platelets) display class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I molecules). Antigens generated endogenously within these cells are bound to MHC-I molecules and presented on the cell surface. This antigen presentation pathway enables the immune system to detect transformed or infected cells displaying peptides from modified-self (mutated) or foreign proteins.In the presentation process, these proteins are mainly degraded into small peptides by cytosolic proteases in the proteasome, but there are also other cytoplasmic proteolytic pathways. Then, peptides are distributed to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the action of heat shock proteins and the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) which translocates the cytosolic peptides into the ER lumen in an ATP-dependent transport mechanism. There are several ER chaperones involved in MHC-I assembly, such as calnexin, calreticulin, Erp57, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), and tapasin. Specifically, the complex of TAP, tapasin, MHS Class 1, ERp57, and calreticulin is called the peptide-loading complex (PLC). Peptides are loaded to MHC-I peptide binding groove between two alpha helices at the bottom of the α1 and α2 domains of the MHC class I molecule. After releasing from tapasin, peptide-MHC-I complexes (pMHC-I) exit the ER and are transported to the cell surface by exocytic vesicles.Naïve anti-viral T cells (CD8+) cannot directly eliminate transformed or infected cells. They have to be activated by the pMHC-I complexes of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Here, antigen can be presented directly (as described above) or indirectly (cross-presentation) from virus-infected and non-infected cells. After the interaction between pMHC-I and TCR, in presence of co-stimulatory signals and/or cytokines, T cells are activated, migrate to the peripheral tissues and kill the target cells (infected or damaged cells) by inducing cytotoxicity.Cross-presentation is a special case in which MHC-I molecules are able to present extracellular antigens, usually displayed only by MHC-II molecules. This ability appears in several APCs, mainly plasmacytoid dendritic cells in tissues that stimulate CD8+ T cells directly. This process is essential when APCs are not directly infected, triggering local antiviral and anti-tumor immune responses immediately without trafficking the APCs in the local lymph nodes.


== Presentation of extracellular antigens: Class II ==
Antigens from the extracellular space and sometimes also endogenous ones, are enclosed into endocytic vesicles and presented on the cell surface by MHC-II molecules to the helper T cells expressing CD4 molecule. Only APCs  such as dendritic cells, B cells or macrophages express MHC-II molecules on their surface in substantial quantity, so expression of MHC-II molecules is more cell-specific than MHC-I.APCs usually internalise exogenous antigens by endocytosis, but also by pinocytosis, macroautophagy, endosomal microautophagy or chaperone-mediated autophagy. In the first case, after internalisation, the antigens are enclosed in vesicles called endosomes. There are three compartments involved in this antigen presentation pathway: early endosomes, late endosomes or endolysosomes and lysosomes, where antigens are hydrolized by lysosome-associated enzymes (acid-dependent hydrolases, glycosidases, proteases, lipases). This process is favored by gradual reduction of the pH. The main proteases in endosomes are cathepsins and the result is the degradation of the antigens into oligopeptides.MHC-II molecules are transported from the ER to the MHC class II loading compartment together with the protein invariant chain (Ii, CD74). A non classical MHC-II molecule (HLA-DO and HLA-DM) catalyses the exchange of part of the CD74 (CLIP peptide) with the peptide antigen. Peptide-MHC-II complexes (pMHC-II) are transported to the plasma membrane and the processed antigen is presented to the helper T cells in the lymph nodes.APCs undergo a process of maturation while migrating, via chemotactic signals, to lymphoid tissues, in which they lose the phagocytic capacity and develop an increased ability to communicate with T-cells by antigen-presentation. As well as in CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, APCs need pMHC-II and additional costimulatory signals to fully activate naive T helper cells.
Alternative pathway of endogenous antigen processing and presentation over MHC-II molecules exists in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEC) via the process of autophagy. It is important for the process of central tolerance of T cells in particular the negative selection of autoreactive clones. Random gene expression of the whole genome is achieved via the action of AIRE and a self-digestion of the expressed molecules presented on both MHC-I and MHC-II molecules.


== Presentation of native intact antigens to B cells ==
B-cell receptors on the surface of B cells bind to intact native and undigested antigens of a structural nature, rather than to a linear sequence of a peptide which has been digested into small fragments and presented by MHC molecules. Large complexes of intact antigen are presented in lymph nodes to B cells by follicular dendritic cells in the form of immune complexes. Some APCs expressing comparatively lower levels of lysosomal enzymes are thus less likely to digest the antigen they have captured before presenting it to B cells.

Dog City,"Dog City is an animated television series that was produced by Nelvana Limited and Jim Henson Productions in association with Channel 4 and Global Television Network. The series ran for three seasons, airing on Fox Kids from September 26, 1992, to November 26, 1994; in Canada, the series aired on YTV until 2000. The series contained both animation made by Nelvana, and puppetry by Jim Henson Productions - similar to Little Muppet Monsters - and invoked a mixture of detective fiction with police comedy.The series starred Kevin Clash as Eliot Shag, a German Shepherd animator, and the voice talents of Ron White as Ace Hart, a cartoon German Shepherd private detective who Eliot animates. Each episode of Dog City focus on the exploits of Ace as he tackles various crimes around the titular Dog City, based on the stories Eliot devises from events that happen in real-life that inspire him, with the pair often interacting with each other during work to animate an episode of Ace's cartoon series. Dog City was spawned following an hour-long live-action television film, titled Dog City: The Movie, which was created for an episode of The Jim Henson Hour in 1989, with the muppet cast created for the film incorporated into the series.


== Television film ==
Dog City was originally an hour-long, broadcast on May 5, 1989, as an episode of The Jim Henson Hour, featuring the characters as puppets. In Dog City: The Movie, Ace Yu inherits a bar-restaurant called the Dog House following the death of his Uncle Harry and is harassed for protection money by crime syndicate boss Bugsy Them (who was responsible for the death of Uncle Harry. Harry as it turns out, was actually Ace's father). Refusing to pay or fight him, Bugsy kidnaps Ace's love interest, Colleen. There are car chases and shoot-em-ups and rubber duckies involved in the action. In the end, Ace defeats Bugsy and gets the girl.


=== Characters ===
Ace Yu (performed by Kevin Clash) - A German Shepherd adopted by Chinese Pekingese parents. Although Ace's puppet is a Hand-Rod Puppet, it is later modified into a Live-Hand Puppet when it was used to play Eliot in the TV series.
Colleen Barker (performed by Fran Brill) - A Rough Collie who serves as Ace's love interest. The name was later used in TV series.
Bugsy Them (performed by Jim Henson) - A vain bulldog crime boss who is proud of his tail. His puppet is later used to play Bruno in the TV series.
Miss Belle (performed by Camille Bonora) - A poodle that is the key associate and the wife of Bugsy Them.
Mad Dog (performed by Steve Whitmire) - Bugsy Them's dimwitted St. Bernard henchman. His puppet is later used to play Bowser in the TV series.
Scruffy (performed by Gord Robertson) - Bugsy Them's henchman who is always scratching at his fleas.
Laughing Boy (performed by Rickey Boyd) - Bugsy Them's henchman who is always laughing and cracking jokes.
Bubba (performed by Jerry Nelson) - The bartender at the Dog House. He is a recycled and modified version of the Wolfhound from The Muppet Show.
Mac (performed by Steve Whitmire) - The waiter at the Dog House. Although Steve Whitmire performed Mac in most scenes, Mac was performed by Rickey Boyd in a scene where he was sweeping.
Quackers (performed by Rob Mills) - Ace Yu's sailor duck doll.
Rowlf the Dog (performed by Jim Henson) - The piano-playing dog from The Muppet Show is the narrator of the TV movie.Dog City: The Movie also features cameos by Sprocket the Dog from Fraggle Rock, Lyle the Dog and Baskerville the Hound from The Muppet Show, a dog character that resembles Tramp from Lady and the Tramp, and a background pug that later appears in Jim Henson's Animal Show, Puppet Up!, and other Henson Alternative projects.
The Muppets of Ace Yu and his associates would make cameos in The Muppets at Walt Disney World and would later go on to become Eliot Shag and the other ""real world"" counterparts to the animated characters.
Dog City: The Movie (sans the framing sequences) was released to regions 1 and 2.
The company's YouTube channel has 6 clips from the pilot in a playlist called ""Dogs of Anarchy!"".


== Premise ==
Dog City focuses on the lives of various anthromorphic dogs and cats that reside in two different worlds - a live-action world portrayed by muppets; and an animated world. The stories themselves focus on animator Eliot Shag and his cartoon creation, canine private investigator Ace Hart, both of whom are German Shepherd. Each episode focuses on Elliot creating new animated stories featuring Ace for a television program named after the character, with Ace playing out the stories that Elliot devises from inspiration he has from real-life events in his apartment building within his cartoon series' setting of Dog City. Both Eliot and Ace maintain a friendly relationship, as the latter knows he is a cartoon character and often breaks the fourth wall to speak with Elliot in regards to various issues he encounters during the animating of episodes, often when something he is doing or the story itself doesn't feel right to him.
During the live-action sequences, Eliot faces different problems relating to his work life and his personal life, including contending with his building's grouchy bulldog superintendent Bruno. As a recurring gag, many of the characters made for Elliot's cartoon series are based on the residents of the building that he knows of and interacts with - Bruno himself being the inspiration for the character of Bugsy Vile, a notorious crime-boss whom Ace regularly has to deal with in many of the plots Eliot devises, alongside Artie, Eliot's young friend and animatior assistant, being the idea behind Ace's own sidekick Eddie, a young newspaper boy.
During the first series, Eliot has feelings for his neighbour Coleen, the inspiration for Ace's own love interest Rosie, chief of police for Dog City. The later series replaced Eliot's love interest with Artie's mother Terri. In some episodes, Eliot also spends time animating additional side stories alongside the main stories that Ace stars in.

Heinrich Haake,"Heinrich “Heinz” Haake (24 January 1892 – 17 September 1945) was a Nazi Party Gauleiter and government official.


== Early life ==
The son of a city architect, he attended elementary school and grammar school, and after his education was complete, was employed as a bank clerk in Cologne. In 1914 when the First World War broke out, he joined the army as a one-year volunteer. He won the Iron Cross second class and was wounded four times, lastly in the battle of Langemarck in Belgium, after which he was classified as severely disabled. In 1919 after discharge from the military with the rank of Unteroffizier, he returned to Cologne. He became active in the Völkisch movement and joined the Deutschvölkischer Schutz- und Trutzbund. In 1922 he became a member of the Nazi Party. When it was temporarily banned in 1924, he switched to the National Socialist Freedom Movement and on 7 December 1924 became its only member in the Prussian Landtag.


== Nazi career ==
When the Nazi Party was re-established in February 1925, Haake become the local leader of the party in Cologne.  Then, on 27 March 1925, he was appointed Gauleiter of Rhineland-South. He officially re-joined the Party on 14 April (membership number 13,328). However, he proved to be difficult to work with, and was often in conflict with his Gau Business Manager, Josef Grohé. On 1 June he was replaced as Gauleiter by his Deputy, Robert Ley. In July he was made Ortsgruppenleiter (Local Group Leader) in Cologne. In September 1925, he became a member of the National Socialist Working Association, a short-lived group of north and northwest German Gaue, organized and led by Gregor Strasser, which unsuccessfully sought to amend the Party program. It was dissolved in 1926 following the Bamberg Conference. From 1928 to 1932 he was a manager of the Nazi faction in the Landtag, becoming 3rd Vice-President of that body in 1932.
On 15 July 1932 Haake was appointed Landesinspekteur-West. In this position, he had oversight responsibility for the Gaue of Dusseldorf, Essen, Koblenz-Trier, Koln-Aachen & Saarland, and reported directly to Robert Ley.  This was a short-lived initiative by Gregor Strasser to centralize control over the Gaue. However, it was unpopular with the Gauleiters and was repealed on Strasser's fall from power in December 1932. At that time, Haake became leader of the Organization Department at the Brown House in Munich, again under Ley, who had succeeded Strasser as Reichsorganisationsleiter.
After the Nazi seizure of power, Haake was elected 1st Vice President of the Prussian Landtag in March 1933. On 5 March he was elected to the Reichstag for electoral constituency 20, (Cologne-Aachen). On 11 March he was appointed Landeshauptmann of Prussia’s Rhine Province and would remain in this position until May 1945.  In October 1933 he was named a member of the Academy for German Law. In 1934 he became a member of the Provincial Council of Rhine Province and also was appointed Reichsinspekteur in the Reichsleitung (Reich Leadership) of the Party. In June 1938 he was named an Honorary Senator of the University of Cologne. In February 1941, Haake attended a meeting with representatives of the Aktion T4 program, concerning the establishment of a euthanasia program for mentally institutionalized patients in Rhine Province. At first resistant, Haake relented when shown a Führer decree authorizing and ordering the implementation.
A member of the Sturmabteilung (SA), he attained the rank of SA-Brigadeführer in 1936, SA-Gruppenführer in 1938 and, on 24 January 1942, SA-Obergruppenführer.At the end of the war in May 1945, he was arrested by the British. Interned in Recklinghausen, he was transferred from there to the prison hospital at Velen, where he died on 17 September.

Highway Tune,"""Highway Tune"" is a song by American rock band Greta Van Fleet. It was their first single from their debut EP Black Smoke Rising. It topped the Billboard Mainstream Rock and Active Rock charts in September 2017. The song, and the rest of its respective EP, is also part of the band's double EP From the Fires, released on November 10, 2017.


== Background ==
""Highway Tune"" was the first song the band Greta Van Fleet had ever written and recorded together. The song's initial guitar riff was cited by guitarist Jake Kiszka as being written as early back as 2010—seven years prior to the song's release as a single, and two years prior to the band even being formed. The riff was then brought to early writing and recording sessions upon the band forming in 2012, and was later reformatted and demoed twice before being recorded in its final form. The song was initially used in an episode of the television show Shameless in January 2016. The song was officially released as one of four songs for the band's debut EP, Black Smoke Rising. The song was released on March 31, 2017 as a single, and on the EP on April 21, 2017. The song's music video was released 2 days prior to the EP's release, and is mostly a performance-based video, with the band playing in an abandoned warehouse.


== Themes and composition ==
The song has received many comparisons to the work of Led Zeppelin, including comparison to the vocals of Robert Plant.


== Reception ==
The song topped the Billboard Mainstream Rock and Active Rock stations in September 2017. The Mainstream Rock chart was topped in just 14 weeks. Billboard magazine noted that, outside of solo musicians breaking away from their original band, Greta Van Fleet with ""Highway Tune"" was the fastest for a band to top the Mainstream Rock charts with their debut single since Tantric's 2001 single ""Breakdown"" and 3 Doors Down's 2000 single ""Kryptonite"". Loudwire named it the second best hard rock song of 2017. HelloMusicTheory ranked the song as the 8th best rock song of the 2010s.

Staircase voltammetry,"Staircase voltammetry is a derivative of linear sweep voltammetry.  In linear sweep voltammetry the current at a working electrode is measured while the potential between the working electrode and a reference electrode is swept linearly in time. Oxidation or reduction of species is registered as a peak or trough in the current signal at the potential at which the species begins to be oxidized or reduced. 
In staircase voltammetry, the potential sweep is a series of stair steps.  The current is measured at the end of each potential change, right before the next, so that the contribution to the current signal from the capacitive charging current is reduced.

Pittosporum eugenioides,"Pittosporum eugenioides, common names lemonwood or tarata, is a species of New Zealand native evergreen tree. Growing to 12 m (39 ft) tall by 5 m (16 ft) broad, it is conical when young but more rounded in shape when mature. Its leaves are mottled yellow-green with curly edges and a salient bright midrib, and have a strong lemony smell when crushed. It has highly fragrant clusters of attractive yellow-cream flowers in spring, followed by distinctive black seed capsules. It is found throughout New Zealand's North and South Islands along forest margins and stream banks from sea level to 600 m (1,969 ft).  It is New Zealand's largest Pittosporum.The binomial qualifier eugenioides means ""resembling Eugenia"", a different genus of plants.The variegated cultivar 'Variegatum' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.


== Life cycle/phenology ==
Pittosporum eugenioides starts out as a small compact tree, as it matures it becomes a tall branched tree. The lemonwood flowers between October and December. The following year after flowering the capsules will open. The capsules open the next year because the fruit of the lemonwood takes between 12 and 14 months to ripen. There is unripe fruit and ripe fruit present on the lemonwood at the same time, this is the current season’s fruit and last season’s fruit. Lemonwood is pollinated by both insects and birds, the seeds are bird dispersed. The seeds of the lemonwood germinate quickly and will become seedlings within a month.


== Range ==
Pittosporum euegnioides is endemic to New Zealand. There are ""about 200 trees and shrubs"" in the genus located in neighbouring parts of the world. Countries with the same genus found include; Africa, Australia, some Pacific islands, southern & eastern Asia, and New Zealand.  
A reason for this endemic occurrence is due to the isolation of New Zealand over a long period of time.


=== New Zealand range ===
Pittosporum euginiodes is found throughout New Zealand’s South Island and North Island in low lying forests. It is found in forest clearings and along forest margins up to 600m above sea level.


=== Habitat preferences ===
Pittosporum euegnioides can be found in a cooler, mature, lowland and subalpine forest climate zone throughout New Zealand. The species can be found in regenerating areas of forest, both young and old. It has proved to be a great plant for establishing a quick canopy.
This species, along with other Pittosporum are making their way in to the average house hold gardens. Nurseries and Garden Centres are stocking this native because it is suited to New Zealand conditions where it naturally grew many years ago.At home in the garden, P. euegnioides prefers a sunny to part shade position, does not mind the wind, and thrives in soil with good drainage.


== Cultivation ==
The viability of the lemonwood's seeds is affected by moisture levels of the soil. If the moisture levels are too high the seed is likely to become unviable.  The lemonwood like other pittosporums is somewhat drought resistant  therefore rainfall is not a major factor in the lemonwoods survival. P. eugenioides is relatively simple to look after from season at home. It grows well, thriving off regular watering intervals during Summer. It enjoys a feed with general tree and shrub fertiliser twice a year during Spring and Summer while it is growing. Responds well to pruning also, which will assure survival in the forest too if disturbed.


== Ecology ==
The pittosporum flower weevil (Aneuma rubricale) is a parasite that feeds on the underside of the lemonwood leaves. This parasite does not kill the lemonwood it just damages the leaves through its feeding. The holes the weevils eat in the leaves are visible because the leaf reacts causing a dark brownie purple ring to form around the hole. Pittosporum eugenioides is only a host to the adult weevil as the larvae are hosted on different pittosporums. Common garden pests can cover this plant, such as Aphids and blister scale (Psyilids). Both can easily be controlled and treated with an insecticide. The best time to spray as a preventative is February, then again in October.


== Citrus aroma ==
The sweet scent of the flowers suggest nectar loving birds find this an ideal plant to forage from. The experiment was carried out to see if the citrus-like chemicals were the same ones that are present in lemon-like species, such as Verbena varieties. The lemony leaves are a unique combination of scented chemicals found in the oil produced. Octyl acetate, Terpinen-4-ol and Decanol were found in a test that was carried out. Octyl acetate is responsible for the ""fruity, Jasmine, herbaceous aroma"". Terpinen-4-ol scent is ""somewhere between peppermint and pine"". Finally, Decanol is a ""fatty, orange blossom odor"". Results of this test unearthed that this lemonwood aroma combination is very unusual for this genus and the chemicals are different to what you would find in other citrus scented species.


== Traditional uses ==


=== Cultural uses ===
Maori traditionally used the gum and crushed leaves and flowers of the tarata for scent, usually mixed with plant oils such as titoki and kohia.
Maori also used the lemonwood to make hair oils and perfume. For perfume, the oil was mixed with bird fat. The gum from the tree was used for bad breath. They rolled the gum in to a ball and this was thought to last a whole generation. The gum made a great glue when chewed as well.


=== Restoration planting ===
Pittosporum eugenioides is great for establishing a shade canopy in a restoration setting. It then provides an opportunity to introduce understory, shade loving plants to the same location, later planting underneath the lemonwood trees. It is recommended to plant this species closer than you would normally find in the established forest. ""close planting imitates the growth of the seedlings on the forest floor"", resulting in plants tending to grow upward more rapidly. P. eugenioides is one of the best plants for this rapid canopy growth because it is already fast growing.    
Lemonwood is on the recommended list for replanting ""small trees up to 6m"" naturally occurring species in to the design guidelines of the Christchurch City Council. ""Hardy native species offer a great number of benefits"" and are more flexible to suit local conditions compared to ""foreign"" plant selection.


=== Home garden design ===
It is important to include historic, naturally occurring species planting design because they perform well in local conditions. ""As well as looking good, the design provides wildlife habitat, recreational spaces, also assisting in filtering water runoff"".P. eugenioides in a home setting will most likely be found as a hedging or screening plant. Happy to be near a swimming pool, a great choice too because it has minimal leaf litter drop. Great in a windy position in a design and also provides a barrier for the surrounding more intolerant plants. Great as a greenery backdrop with the textural leaves clustered together as well.

Isma'il ibn Yusuf,"Isma'il ibn Yusuf ibn Ibrahim ibn Abdallah ibn al-Hasan ibn al-Hasan ibn Ali ibn Abi Talib was a Hasanid Alid who rose in revolt against the Abbasid Caliphate in the Hejaz in 865–866, during the Anarchy at Samarra.The uprising began in Mecca in April 865, when Isma'il and his supporters forced the local Abbasid governor, Ja'far ibn al-Fadl ibn Isa ibn Musa, to flee the city. The resistance of the local garrison was overcome. Isma'il then proceeded to plunder the city, even removing the valuable objects from the Ka'aba and emptying the treasury of money and valuables, as well as extorting 200,000 gold dinars from the inhabitants. The motives for his rebellion are not clear, but may be connected to the renewed persecution of the Alids under the Abbasid caliphs from al-Mutawakkil's reign onward.After fifty days he left for Medina, but although the governor of the latter made no attempt to resist and went into hiding, Isma'il returned to Mecca and laid siege to it. As the siege dragged on, famine spread in Mecca, and a lot of its inhabitants died; after 57 days, the Alid left Mecca and made for Jeddah. There he repeated his exactions, confiscating wealth, merchandise, and food.In January 866, on the Day of Arafah, he attacked the Hajj pilgrims and their accompanying Abbasid military escort, sent by Caliph al-Mu'tazz. After killing some 1100 pilgrims, the rest fled into Mecca, and did not dare exit the city, while Isma'il returned to Jeddah unmolested. He died in March/April 866 of smallpox. Isma'il's brother Muhammad succeeded him, but in the event he was pushed by Abbasid forces into the Yamama region in central Arabia, where he founded the Ukhaydhir dynasty.

"Gorteen, Templeport","Gorteen (from Irish: Gortín meaning 'A small cultivated field or garden') is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Templeport and barony of Tullyhaw.


== Geography ==
Gorteen is bounded on the north by Camagh townland, on the west by Derryragh and Sruhagh townlands, on the southeast by Derrycassan townland. It is traversed by minor roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 104 statute acres.


== History ==
In medieval times the McGovern barony of Tullyhaw was divided into economic taxation areas called ballibetoes, from the Irish Baile Biataigh (Anglicized as 'Ballybetagh'), meaning 'A Provisioner's Town or Settlement'. The original purpose was to enable the farmer, who controlled the baile, to provide hospitality for those who needed it, such as poor people and travellers. The ballybetagh was further divided into townlands farmed by individual families who paid a tribute or tax to the head of the ballybetagh, who in turn paid a similar tribute to the clan chief. The steward of the ballybetagh would have been the secular equivalent of the erenagh in charge of church lands. There were seven ballibetoes in the parish of Templeport. Gorteen was located in the ballybetagh of Ballymagauran. The historical spellings of the ballybetagh are Ballymackgawran & Ballimacgawran (Irish = Baile Mhic Shamhráin = McGovern's Town).
Until the 19th century, Gorteen formed part of the modern townland of Camagh as a subdivision, so its history is the same as Camagh until then.
The Tithe Applotment Books for 1827 list twelve tithepayers in the townland.The Gorteen Valuation Office Field books are available for November 1839.In 1841 the population of the townland was 40, being 24 males and 16 females. There were seven houses in the townland, all of which were inhabited.In 1851 the population of the townland was 39, being 23 males and 16 females, the reduction being due to the Great Famine (Ireland). There were six houses in the townland, all were inhabited.Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists eight landholders in the townland.The 1861 Census states there were 7 houses in the townland with a total population of 29, 13 males and 16 females.The 1871 Census states there were 7 houses in the townland with a total population of 32 people.
The 1881 Census states there were 7 houses in the townland with a total population of 36 people.
The 1891 Census states there were 7 houses in the townland with a total population of 31 people, of whom 18 were males and 13 females.
In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are ten families listed in the townland, and in the 1911 census of Ireland, there are only eight families listed in the townland.

Achalpur,"Achalpur, formerly known as Ellichpur and Illychpur, is a city and a municipal council in Amravati District in the Indian state of Maharashtra. It is the second most populous city in Amravati District after Amravati and seventh most populous city in Vidarbha. Achalpur camp is known as Paratwada.


== History ==
Achalpur was the earliest capital of a branch of the Rashtrakuta dynasty, which emerged sometime in the 8th century. It was the site of a battle between the Rashtrakutas and the Kalachuris in the 9th century.Achalpur or Ellichpur is first mentioned authentically in the 13th century as one of the famous cities of the Deccan. Though tributary to the Delhi Sultanate after 1294, it remained under Hindu administration till 1318, when it came directly under the Muslim Delhi Sultanate.
In 1347 Achalpur with the Berar region was ruled by the Bahmani Sultanate.
In 1490 Fathullah Imad-ul-Mulk proclaimed his independence and founded the Imad Shahi dynasty of the Berar Sultanate. He proceeded to annex Mahur to his new kingdom and established his capital at Ellichpur. It was afterwards capital of the Berar Subah at intervals until the Mughal occupation, when the seat of the provincial governor was moved to Balapur. The town retains many relics of the Sultans of Berar.As the Mughal empire deteriorated in the 18th century, Achalpur along with the rest of Berar came under the rule of the Nizam of Hyderabad. In 1853, Berar Province came under British administration, although it remained formally part of the Hyderabad state until 1903 when the province became the Berar Division of the Central Provinces. Achalpur, known by the British as Ellichpur, became part of East Berar, with Amraoti (Amravati) as capital of the division. In 1867 East Berar was split into the districts of Amraoti and Ellichpur district, with Ellichpur as the headquarters of Ellichpur District. The district had an area of 2,605 square miles (6,750 km2).
In 1901 Achalpur had a population of 29,740, with ginning factories and a considerable trade in cotton and forest produce. It was connected by good roads with Amraoti and Chikhaldara.  Berar was annexed to British India in 1903 and merged with the Central Provinces, and in 1905 Ellichpur District was merged into Amraoti District. The civil station of Paratwada, 5 km. from the town of Ellichpur, contained the principal public buildings at the beginning of the 20th century.After India's independence in 1947, the Central Provinces became the province, and after 1950 the state, Madhya Pradesh. The 1956 States Reorganisation Act redrew the boundaries of India's states along linguistic lines, and the predominantly Marathi-speaking Amravati District was transferred to Bombay State, which was renamed Maharashtra in 1960.


== Geography ==
Achalpur and Paratwada are twin cities located in the lap of Satpuda . It has an average elevation of 369 metres (1210 ft). These twin cities are surrounded by rivers named Sapan and Bicchhan, the tributaries of Chandrabhaga river. There is hilly area that acts like a fence to this city. This city is at the boundary of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. Even Madhya Pradesh is so close to this city that travelling of (about) 12 km changes the state region.


== Demographics ==
As of census 2011 Achalpur Tehsil had a population of 1,12,311.
As of 2001 India census, Achalpur & Paratwada had a population of 107,304. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Achalpur has an average literacy rate of 88%, higher than the national average of 59.59%; with 54.41% of the males and 46% of females literate. 12% of the population is under 6 years of age.


== Transportation ==
Achalpur railway station is the northern terminus of the 762 mm narrow gauge railway known locally as the Shakuntala railway. This line is composed of two legs intersecting with the Mumbai–Kolkata standard gauge railway at Murtajapur — the 76 km northern leg to Achalpur and the 113 km southeastern leg to Yavatmal. As of 2004 this line was still owned by a London-based company which had leased the line to India's Central Railway since 1903.Paratwada is well connected to major cities by state highways. Maharashtra Major State Highway 6 and Major State Highway 24 passes from Paratwada. Both public and private transport are popular in Paratwada. Private companies too run buses to major cities throughout India. Auto rickshaws and cycle rickshaws are allowed to operate in this city. Also The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) provides transport services to this city for interstate travel.

In 1892 he became an honorary member of the Croatian Pedagogic-Literary Society, in 1924 a member of the Society of the Brothers of the Croatian Dragon, and an honorary citizen of Krapina.


== Writer ==
As a writer, his work is a continuation of Croatia's romantic poetry in the tradition of August Šenoa and Franjo Marković. His first appearance as a writer was the song Pri povratku (""On the way back"", Vienac, 1873, 49). He mostly published patriotic songs, romances and ballads with themes from Croatian history and folklore (Krapinske elegije, Damjan Juda, knez dubrovački, Kata Lovićeva etc.), as well as reflexive lyricism in publications such as Vienac (1873–1886, 1888–1891, 1893–1902 ), Hrvatska lipa (1875), Hrvatski dom (1876), Obzor (1898, 1900, 1901, 1904), Prosvjeta (1904–1913), Hrvatsko kolo (1905, 1906, 1908, 1930), Katolički list (1906, 1915, 1916), Hrvatska smotra (1907–1910, 1933), Hrvatsko pravo (1908, 1924), Koledar hrvatskoga katoličkoga narodnoga đaštva (1909, 1910), Serafinski perivoj (1909–1913), Književni prilog (1911, 1912, 1913–1915), Hrvatska (1912, 1914, 1915), Hrvatska prosvjeta (1914–1918), Naša misao (1914, 1915 ), Jeka od Osijeka (1918, 1919), Vijenac (1923, 1925, 1927), Hrvatsko pravo (1924, 1925), Omladina (1924, 1925), Hranilovićeva spomenica (1925), Selo i grad (1928/1929, 1930, 1931), Hrvatski list (1939), Novo doba (1940) and others. He wrote a single short story Samo četvrt sata (Vienac, 1880, 15–18).He signed his works in codes and pseudonyms: A., G. A., Gj. A., Gj. A-d, Gj. Ar., O. D., R. R., Ivančanin, Georg Arnold. He published several books of poems, and the poem Domovina has gained him popularity. His works were published in many anthologies, calendars and almanacs. The selection of his poetry was translated to Czech, Esperanto, German, Slovak and Italian. He expressed his views on literature in talks at the Matica hrvatska conferences: Umjetnost prema znanosti, Može li umjetnost zamijeniti vjeru, Jedinstvena hrvatska narodna kultura (Glas Matice hrvatske, 1906, 1908, 1909).


== Philosopher ==
As a philosopher, he was influenced by Leibniz, Johann Friedrich Herbart and Hermann Lotze, representing the ""spiritualist positivism"" movement and the view that the knowledge of the world can be reached only by the combined efforts of science, art and religion.  He wrote on the fundamental questions of philosophy, which he defined as the science of ""final causes and purposes of being"".In the treatise Zadnja bića (""Last beings"", Rad JAZU, 1888, 93 ) he conceived a world composed from the variety of simple, immutable soullike ""last beings"" that are connected by the feeling of touch and hierarchically arranged according to different levels of awareness, with absolute consciousness, the God, occupying the peak of the hierarchy. According to Arnold, faith represents the supreme stronghold of a man and the basic principle of harmony of his spiritual functions.According to some opinions, in his later works such as O psihologiji bez duše and Monizam i kršćanstvo (Rad JAZU, 1909, 176 and 178) Arnold has abandoned his earlier philosophical views. Others such as Pavao Vuk-Pavlović, Stjepan Matičević and Blaženka Despot however maintain that Arnold's philosophical view was uniform and consistent - spiritualist pluralism which doesn't completely exclude spiritualist monism.Arnold is one of the founders of the Croatian philosophical terminology, having authored two influential high school textbooks (Logika and Psihologija) that were standard textbooks for more than thirty years.At Arnold's proposal, in 1896 the Pedagogical Seminar for theoretical and practical training of future secondary school teachers was founded at the Faculty of Philosophy in Zagreb. As a teacher, organizer of educational system, the first Professor of Pedagogy at the Faculty of Philosophy and the first head of the Pedagogical Seminar, has influenced many generations of teachers.Arnold died in Zagreb.

Tatia gens,"The gens Tatia was a minor plebeian family at ancient Rome.  This gens is perhaps best known from the legendary figure of Titus Tatius, a Sabine king who fought against Romulus, and who subsequently became joint ruler of Rome.  None of the Tatii held any of the higher magistracies of the Roman Republic, but a number are known from inscriptions.


== Origin ==
The Tatii claimed descent from Titus Tatius, a Sabine king, who after fighting Romulus to a standstill, agreed to joint rulership of the city.  During this period, many Sabines settled at Rome, eventually making up a significant portion of the city's early populace.  While Romulus and Titus Tatius are widely regarded as legendary figures whose historicity cannot be established, modern scholars agree that there was a large Sabine element in the early Roman population, from which the Tatii might have been descended.


== Praenomina ==
The main praenomina of the Tatii were Lucius, Marcus, Gaius, and Aulus, all of which were common throughout all periods of Roman history.  A freedwoman of this gens bore the Faliscan praenomen Volta.


== Branches and cognomina ==
Inscriptions of the Tatii are found throughout central and southern Italy, from Umbria to Lucania.  Besides Rome, the only place with a significant number of inscriptions from this family is Tarracina, in southern Latium.  At least one family of this gens settled in Numidia.  None of the Tatii known from epigraphy bear hereditary surnames; all of their cognomina seem to be personal names.


== Members ==
This list includes abbreviated praenomina.  For an explanation of this practice, see filiation.Titus Tatius, the king of Cures in Sabinum, during the time of Romulus.  According to legend, his army assaulted Rome following the Rape of the Sabine Women, and fought the Romans fiercely, until Hersilia and the Sabine wives of the Romans interceded, bringing about a truce between the two peoples.  Tatius became joint ruler of Rome alongside Romulus.  He was later slain in a riot at Lavinium, supposedly because he had insulted the ambassadors of Laurentum, a neighboring town.

J.T. Hope, a former police officer and marine and now owner of the Circle Hope Ranch, decides to start a program for troubled teens on the ranch to help turn them around. The first three boys are Keith (Brian Gross), Brooker (Richard Lee Jackson), and Ernesto (J. D. Pardo). The workers at the ranch are Shorty (Barry Corbin) and a former juvenile delinquent Colt Webb (Lorenzo Lamas), who was given a second chance with the help of J.T. As the program goes on, Brooker and Ernesto make progress but J.T. can't get to Keith. He finds out that Keith was being made to do crime and drugs by his older brother Ajax (Brad Hawkins) and he wasn't actually a bad kid. Keith is driving a tractor and it gets out of control, almost running over a young girl called Molly (Isabelle Howell). JT is really angry at Keith and wants to give up on trying to turn him around, but Molly's mother convinces him to give Keith another chance because he isn't trying to be bad. The next day, the three boys have to go back to Juvenile court, and because they made progress, they are allowed another six months at the ranch, giving Keith another chance. The film ends with three more Juvenile court teenagers arriving at the ranch and Keith telling them the rules of the ranch.

Lima was born in Rio de Janeiro to two Brazilian parents who emigrated to Sweden. Lima quickly adapted to his new country, and became a youth international footballer for Sweden. He attended the academy of IFK Norrköping. He played briefly for Norrköping's cooperation team IF Sylvia in 2018. However, in 2018 he suffered a cruciate ligament injury, which was followed by another. Norrköping manager Rikard Norling stated that Lima would have played in a Big Five league had it not been for the two injuries, or at least ""a considerably higher level"" than the Swedish league.Lima made his Allsvenskan debut on 24 May 2021 against Elfsborg. He got his breakthrough on 3 July, when he scored the winning goal at home against giants Malmö. Nonetheless, Lima had to spent the autumn of 2021 on loan at second-tier Östers IF.The Norwegian second-tier club Fredrikstad FK bought Lima in the summer 2022 transfer window. Lima cited the need for a ""change of environment"". Fredrikstad struggled against higher-level teams in the 2023 pre-season, but in March 2023, Lima scored in their penultimate friendly match. He thereby ended Fredrikstad's goalless streak of 495 minutes. In the summer, however he was loaned back to Superettan and Helsingborgs IF.

Société IRF,"Société IRF was an avant-garde art society founded by a group of Japanese artists and photographers based in the city of Fukuoka in 1939. Many of the founding members were photographers such as Wataru Takahashi, Zentoku Tanaka, Giichiro Konomi, and Hisashi Hisano but also included other artists such as Kenshi Ito, who was a painter, and Iwataro Koike, a craftsman. The name of the organization is a pun on the phonetic spelling of the Japanese word for ‘old’ (furui) written backwards. The group's activities were cut short in 1940 as the intensification of the Pacific War led to the Japanese government to pressure photographers, artists, and artisans to contribute to the war effort. In the years after the war many of the members moved to larger cities while others passed away making Société IRF one of the more short-lived avant-garde art groups.


== Historical Context ==
Prior to the establishment of the organization, many of core photographers such as Wataru Takahashi and Hisashi Hisano were also involved in other photography clubs such as the Fukuoka Rollei Club which is considered to be the predecessor of Société IRF. These photographers were highly influenced by the avant-garde photography of Shinko Shashin (The New Photography movement).Their activities can be contextualized in the larger wave of Japanese interest in the Surrealist and Abstract art that were making their way into Japan such as Internationale Ausstellung Film und Foto exhibition in 1931 and the International Surrealist exhibition in 1937, the works of Eugene Atget and Man Ray which introduced by photography magazines such as Photo Times and Asahi Camera. The introduction of Western avant-garde photography is the development of amateur photography clubs across different areas of Japan such as in Osaka and Nagoya such as the Tampei Photography Club and the Naniwa Photography Club.Their exhibitions at the Fukuoka Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall became a meeting place for many other like-minded artists to connect. Through these informal exchanges of ideas about art many other artists came together such as Koike and Ito eventually to form the core group which would go on to found the organization.


== Differences from other Japanese Photography Clubs ==
Unlike other amateur photography clubs which flourished around Japan before WWII, Société IRF was notable because of its diverse membership which included artists from different fields. Many of the photographers also contributed poetry and sketches to the journals they published. Their culturally comprehensive multi-disciplinary approach can be discerned from exhibitions that they held on subjects such as Okinawan lacquerware and child art.The group saw itself as a cultural society, not limited to only photography but also to art at large. Members of the group would often meet to discuss their works and exchange feedback on a variety of artistic activities as they state in their declaration that their goal is to “theorize and act for the sake of arts and culture.”However, many of the key members died young, were conscripted, or ultimately left Fukuoka so group ceased organized activities in 1940.

== Career ==
Born in Schmölln, she began competing in the event as a teenager, representing the TuS Jena club.  Her first international appearance came at the 2000 World Junior Championships in Athletics, where she jumping in the qualifying rounds. She returned to the competition for the 2002 edition and reached the final, placing seventh overall.Demut won her first national title at the German Athletics Championships 2003 and set a personal best of 13.74 m that year for fifth place at the 2003 European Athletics U23 Championships. She achieved a jump of 13.96 m in Stuttgart in February 2004 and had consecutive runner-up placings at the German Indoor Championships in 2004 and 2005. A quiet 2006 season for her was highlighted by an outdoor best jump of 13.96 m. She cleared the fourteen-metre mark for the first time the following year and claimed the national title both outdoors and indoors. Demut won the German outdoor title again in 2008 and placed sixth at the European Cup.She made three international appearances in 2009: she jumped in the triple jump qualifiers at the 2009 European Athletics Indoor Championships, was eleventh at the 2009 European Team Championships, and then represented Germany for the first time at world senior level, taking part in the heats at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics in Berlin. That year she had won at the 2009 German Athletics Championships, improved her indoor best to 14.06 m and set an outright best of 14.20 m outdoors in Ulm. Demut retained her indoor German title the year after and had her fourth straight win outdoors at the 2010 German Athletics Championships.

She entered the 2011 European Athletics Indoor Championships as the athlete with the leading indoor mark of the season, but failed to match her previous form and was eliminated in the heats stage with a best jump of 13.81 m from her series. Demut set a new best outdoors as well, jumping 14.57 m in Wesel in June to improve the German outdoor record by eleven centimetres – this bettered Helga Radtke's mark which had stood for almost seventeen years. She was set to be a contender at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, but a heel injury four days before the competition forced her to withdraw and bring her season to a close.

Battle of Fancheng,"The Battle of Fancheng or the Battle of Fan Castle was fought between the warlords Liu Bei and Cao Cao in 219 in the late Eastern Han dynasty. It is named after Fancheng in present-day Xiangyang, Hubei, a fortress that played a significant role in the battle.


== Background ==
In 218, imperial physician Ji Ben, along with minor treasurer Geng Ji and minister Wei Huang began an insurrection against Cao Cao in his capital of Xuchang, but were quickly quelled and executed. In November 218, Cao Cao sent general Cao Ren to Wan (宛; in present-day Nanyang, Henan) in preparation to launch a strike against Guan Yu. However, due to Cao Ren's wanton policy of conscription and forced labor, Hou Yin (侯音), a military officer under Cao Cao, started a rebellion in with his deputy Wei Kai (衛開) and several thousand troops from Wan's citizenry, and requested help from Guan Yu. By February 219, Cao Ren had crushed the rebellion and killed Hou Yin and Wei Kai, and massacred the citizenry of Wan.In the meantime, tired and angered by forced conscription and labour, a peasant revolt also broke out in Luhun-county (陸渾, located southeast of present-day Song County, Henan) led by rebel leader Sun Lang (孫狼), who killed the county registrar and defected to Guan Yu, receiving military command to work as raiders for Guan Yu.After taking Hanzhong Commandery by defeating Cao Cao in the Hanzhong Campaign in May 219, Liu Bei further expanded his territorial gains in June 219 by sending Meng Da and Liu Feng to take Fangling (房陵; present-day Fang County, Hubei) and Shangyong (上庸; north of present-day Zhushan County, Hubei) commanderies. Cao Cao was temporarily forced to be on the defensive after these continuous setbacks.
Realising the imminent attacks of Liu Bei and possibly Sun Quan, Cao Cao planned to launch a preemptive strike on southern Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan), the eastern part of Liu Bei's territory defended by Guan Yu. The plan reasoned that Liu Bei could not continue his offensive in the north due to the need to consolidate his new gains, and so an attack into southern Jing Province would not be hindered by Liu Bei's invasion elsewhere. However, the plan was called off because Cao Cao's troops still needed time to recover, regroup, and re-supply from the campaign to suppress the rebellion of Hou Yin and Wei Kai, as well as from earlier setbacks in the struggles for Hanzhong Commandery. The worn-out troops were not ready for another campaign.


== Battle ==


=== Initial stages ===
In July, 219, Guan Yu decided to launch an offensive of his own against Cao Cao to build on the conquest of Hanzhong. He ordered Mi Fang and Shi Ren to stay behind to guard Jiangling County and Gong'an County respectively during his absence, while he personally led Liu Bei's forces in southern Jing Province to attack Cao Cao's strongholds in the north.
The campaign's objective was not clearly stated, but Guan Yu led his army along the Han River northward until he laid siege to Fancheng (present-day Fancheng District, Xiangyang, Hubei). From the advance route and the fact that Guan Yu chose to concentrate his main forces on Fancheng, his primary objective was believed to be the conquest of Nanyang Commandery (around present-day Nanyang, Henan). Initially, the cities being attacked were not heavily guarded, as Cao Ren at Fancheng and Lü Chang (呂常) at Xiangyang were both surrounded. Therefore, Cao Cao ordered Yu Jin to aid Cao Ren. After pitching camp on a lower ground about 4 km north to Fancheng, Yu Jin started to prepare a counteroffensive. Eager to prove his loyalty as he was suspected by others, Cao Cao's general Pang De volunteered to lead a detachment to engage Guan Yu, successfully forcing the latter to retreat several times. On one occasion, Pang De fired an arrow that became embedded in Guan Yu's helm. Since then Pang De was widely known and feared among the enemy as ""General White Horse"" because of the white steed he rode into battle.
Although Guan Yu could not defeat Pang De in battle, he nevertheless held firm control over the water routes around the area and maintained the encirclement of Fancheng.


==== Turning of the tide ====
In August, heavy rains caused the Han River to flood. Forces under the command of Yu Jin and Pang De were completely annihilated by the natural disaster, suffering at least 40,000 fatalities, and another 30,000 were captured by Guan Yu's navy. Pang De and Yu Jin were both captured; Yu Jin begged for his life and surrendered, while Pang De refused to surrender and was executed. Prior, Wen Hui had warned of the potential radical weather changes in the south and feared Guan Yu would use river-floods to his advantage. Cao Ren, with several thousand of his surviving troops, were forced on the defensive by staying behind the safety of the walls. At the time, Xu Huang, who was stationed in Wancheng with his force purely consisting of new recruits, was only able to set up defensive fortifications instead of venturing out to relieve Cao Ren. Meanwhile, Hu Xiu (胡修), the Inspector of Jing Province (the position that had the authority to raise troops from within the entire Jing Province), and Fu Fang (傅方), Cao Cao's Administrator of Nanxiang (Nanxiang was located southeast of present-day Xichuan County, Henan), both defected to Guan Yu. Rebels and bandits in the counties of Liang (梁), Jia (郟), also officially accepted Guan Yu's command. Guan Yu's fame spread across Huaxia.Due to the immense threat Guan Yu had begun to pose, Cao Cao considered relocating the capital. When Cao Cao asked his advisers for input, Sima Yi and Jiang Ji strongly opposed. They pointed out that the alliance between Liu Bei and Sun Quan was shaky at best due to the feuding over control of Jing Province, and Sun Quan would definitely be unhappy to see Guan Yu's success. They suggested that Cao Cao send an emissary to Sun Quan to recognize the latter's control over Jiangnan should Sun Quan agree to flank Guan Yu's rear.
Initially, Sun Quan sent an emissary to Guan Yu relating his wish for a marriage to be arranged between his own son and Guan's daughter. However, Guan Yu insulted the emissary and rejected the marriage proposal, infuriating Sun Quan. During the campaign in Xiangyang, Guan Yu's military numbers rose and exhausted his food-supply. Because of this, Guan Yu supposedly sent out troops to confiscate grains stored in Xiang-Guan (located north of present-day Yongzhou, Hunan), within Sun Quan's territory around 600 km from Xiangyang's location. Sun Quan used this incident, coupled with Guan Yu's rejection of Sun Quan's marriage proposal and insult, to justify severing the alliance with Liu Bei.
At the outbreak of the battle, Liu Bei controlled three commanderies in southern Jing Province: Nan, Lingling, and Wuling.


=== Stalemate ===
Guan Yu further ordered reinforcements from Jiangling and Gong'an to lay siege on Fancheng. With only several thousand troops left, Cao Ren was also plagued by low food supplies, so he considered abandoning Fancheng. Someone also urged him to escape while there was still time, since Guan Yu's forces had not completely surrounded Fancheng yet. Man Chong, the Administrator of Runan, disagreed and said, ""The floodwaters may be flowing very fast, but the flood might not last long. Guan Yu had already sent a detachment of troops from his army to station at Jia County (郟縣). There is already much panic and fear among the people living in the lands south of Xu County. Guan Yu doesn't dare to advance further because he's worried that his base (in southern Jing Province) will come under attack. If we abandon Fancheng and leave, we'll end up losing all the territories south of the river. Sir, you should continue to hold up here."" Cao Ren agreed with him. Man Chong drowned his horse and pledged to stay with the soldiers in Fancheng to the end. Cao Ren also strengthened Fancheng's defences, increasing the number of his troops to over 10,000 by drafting every available man in the city and going around the city rallying his soldiers.
As Xu Huang was ordered to reinforce Cao Ren, Cao Cao sent two officers, Xu Shang (徐商) and Lü Jian (呂建) to lead additional reinforcements to join Xu Huang, ordering the latter not to attack until all of the reinforcement sent to him had arrived. To wait for further reinforcements, Xu Huang pushed toward Yangling (陽陵), located to the north of Fancheng. As the majority of Cao Cao's force under Xu Huang's command consisted of new recruits, Xu faithfully carried out Cao Cao's order to restrain from attacking. Guan Yu was well aware of Xu Huang's situation, but due to confidence from the earlier victory had ignored Xu Huang's threat and divided his forces, sending another army to Xiangyang, believing that Fancheng would fall into his control. However, Guan Yu was unsuccessful in breaking through the city's defence.
Xu Huang afterwards seized the opportunity opened by Guan Yu dividing his forces, as Guan Yu's vanguard situated around three miles to the north of Fancheng, leaving a gap between it and the main army. Xu Huang pretended to dig a long trench, giving the false impression of cutting off Guan Yu's vanguard, which fell for the trick and retreated. Xu Huang's army therefore took the abandoned stronghold at Yan (偃) and pressed further toward Guan Yu's main army. By this time, 10,000 battle-hardened veterans led by Yin Shu (殷署) and Zhu Gai (朱蓋) had joined Xu Huang, emboldening Xu Huang's army enough to pose a threat to Guan Yu.


=== Strategies ===
During the stalemate, Cao Cao's emissary returned to Luoyang with a letter from Sun Quan, which informed Cao that Sun planned to attack Guan Yu from the rear in Jing Province. Sun Quan asked Cao Cao to keep this secret so that Guan Yu would not be prepared, and most of Cao Cao's advisers agreed with the plan. However, Dong Zhao objected, pointing out that Liu Bei and Sun Quan are both adversaries of Cao Cao despite the temporary submission of Sun Quan to Cao Cao. For the long term, it would be in the best interest of Cao Cao to weaken both adversaries, instead of letting one adversary become too strong. In the short term, if Guan Yu knew about Sun Quan's attack in his rear, he would certainly withdraw his army to reinforce his home base in Jing Province, and the siege of Fancheng would be lifted. In addition, Fancheng had been under siege for some period of time, and the morale of Cao Cao's forces was low. If this critical information was not passed along to the defenders, some people inside Fancheng might turn their back on Cao Cao, because food supplies were running out. Furthermore, Dong Zhao pointed out that even if Guan Yu knew Sun Quan's intention, he would not retreat swiftly because of his stubbornness and his confidence in the defence of Jiangling and Gong'an counties.Cao Cao and others were convinced by Dong Zhao and did exactly what he had proposed: copies of Sun Quan's letter was tied to arrows, which were then shot into Fancheng and Guan Yu's camp by Xu Huang's archers. The defenders' morale increased, while Guan Yu was put in a dilemma: he did not want to abandon the attack on Cao Cao, because he believed that Jiangling and Gong'an counties, his rear bases, would not easily fall. Furthermore, Guan Yu had conjectured if the enemy defenders were defeated, Sun Quan would exploit the opportunity to attack Cao Cao's weakened defences instead of attacking the three commanderies under Liu Bei, as Guan Yu anticipated Sun Quan would have more to gain in taking the vast region in the eastern region downstream the Yangtze River from Cao Cao than in taking Liu Bei's three commanderies. As Guan Yu was hesitating, Cao Cao personally led another reinforcement army to the battlefield and had already reached Mobei (摩陂; southeast of present-day Jia County, Henan).


=== Conclusion ===
The bulk of the forces under Guan Yu's command was camped in Weitou (圍頭), while the remaining camped in Sizhong (四冢). Xu Huang spread the word of an imminent attack on Weitou, but instead, he led his forces to strike Sizhong unexpectedly. Fearing the Sizhong camp would be lost, Guan Yu led 5,000 troops to the rescue, but the attack of Sizhong was only a decoy, as Guan Yu became ambushed by Xu Huang's men when he was on his way for the rescue mission. The defeated Guan Yu withdrew to his main camp, but Xu Huang's force followed closely behind and charged into Guan's main camp, successfully killing the defectors Hu Xiu and Fu Fang. With his camp overrun by the enemy, Guan Yu was forced to concede defeat by lifting the siege of Fancheng and retreating southward.
All of Cao Cao's commanders at the frontline believed that they should take advantage of the situation and pursue Guan Yu, except Zhao Yan (趙儼), who pointed out that they should not pursue Guan Yu because Guan's force should be left alone so that they could fight Sun Quan, thus weakening both Cao Cao's adversaries. Cao Ren agreed with Zhao Yan and did not pursue Guan Yu, and sure enough, when news of Guan Yu's retreat reached Cao Cao, he sent an emissary to Cao Ren, prohibiting him from giving a chase for exactly that reason.


== Aftermath ==

When Guan Yu returned south, he discovered that his rear bases in Jiangling and Gong'an counties had both surrendered to Lü Meng, the commander of Sun Quan's westward army. Lü Meng held hostage the wives and children of Guan Yu's men, but treated them and the citizenry of Jing Province with utmost care. Guan Yu's soldiers, hearing that Jing Province had fallen to Sun Quan and that their families were in good hands, lost their will to fight and deserted.
Guan Yu, with only a handful of men left, became isolated in Maicheng (麥城; southeast of present-day Dangyang, Hubei) with Sun Quan's forces on three sides and Cao Cao's in the north. As Guan Yu attempted to escape, he and his surviving followers, including his son Guan Ping and subordinate Zhao Lei (趙累), were captured in an ambush near Zhang District (漳鄉) by Sun Quan's generals Zhu Ran and Pan Zhang. Guan Yu was later executed by Sun Quan at Linju (臨沮), along with Guan Ping and Zhao Lei.

== In Romance of the Three Kingdoms ==
In the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, the flooding of the Han River was not a natural occurrence, but instead, was planned by Guan Yu. Guan had the rivers dammed and the dam opened when it was full, thus drowning Cao Cao's armies in the lower plains. This event was known as the Drowning of the Seven Armies (水淹七軍). Pang De put up firm resistance and attempted to escape by swimming, but was captured by Guan Yu's subordinate Zhou Cang. In contrast, Yu Jin was depicted pleading for his life and surrendering to Guan Yu.
Several weeks later, Sun Quan, who had secretly allied with Cao Cao, attacked Guan Yu's army at Jiangling. Sun Quan surprised and defeated Guan Yu's forces there, forcing Guan to lift the siege on Fancheng and retreat. Guan Yu and his son, Guan Ping, while fleeing to Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing), were caught and executed by Sun Quan's soldiers.

Edward Wilkinson (bishop),"Thomas Edward Wilkinson (1837−1914), known as Edward Wilkinson, was an Anglican bishop, legionnaire and travel writer in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The sixth child of a gentleman farmer, he was born at Walsham Hall, Walsham le Willows, Suffolk. Before he was ordained, he joined the French Foreign Legion and travelled around Europe.
As a priest he had the curacies of two consecutive parishes, then spent six years with his wife and children in South Africa as the inaugural Bishop of Zululand. Following a Cornwall incumbency, he was concurrently the rector of St Katherine Coleman, London, and coadjutor bishop of London for north and central Europe. Within this diocese he had the oversight of missions across ten nations. To reach all of his European chaplaincies meant a journey of over 14,000 miles; he made 82 of these episcopal tours.
He published several books, including a Zulu hymn book, an edition of his wife's Zululand journals, and his own travel book relating to his years in Europe. In his Who's Who entry, Wilkinson listed his recreation as ""work"".


== Background ==


=== Parentage ===
Wilkinson's father was Hooper John Wilkinson, (1800–1883), a magistrate and proprietor of a 240-acre (97 ha) farm employing eight labourers and four boys in 1851. His mother was Anne née Howlett (c. 1805–1884). Hooper John, Anne and their son Octavius are buried in the churchyard of St Mary's Church, Walsham le Willows.Thomas Edward Wilkinson was the sixth son, having at least ten siblings. He was born at Walsham Hall, Walsham le Willows, Suffolk on 26 December 1837. His eldest brother was barrister Hooper John Wilkinson (1822–1904). His other elder brothers were George Howlett (1828–1879), Charles Ellis (born 1829), Harry Evan ""Henry"" Wilkinson (born 1834) and Rev. Octavius (1836–1870). Octavius attended Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and was made priest alongside his brother Thomas Edward. The youngest brother was Joseph Henry Newman (born 1850).  His sisters were Anne (born 1824), Mary Ann (born 1826), Elizabeth Frances (born 1833) and Edith Margaret (born 1847).


=== Family home ===
The 17th-century red-brick Walsham Hall was built on the site of an ancient manor house. H. J. Wilkinson purchased the property in 1828, rebuilt the hall, and was living in it by 1841. T. E. Wilkinson inherited the house and sold it to the Church of England, later adding some land to the gift. The house was renamed as Walsham Farm Home and opened as a Church of England children's home in 1896. The home closed in 1921, was sold, and became a school. After serving as various private residences, the building was demolished in 1968. The classical-styled Willow Court and Willows House now stand on the site.

			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Education ===
Wilkinson was educated at Bury St Edmunds grammar school and King's College London. He was admitted on 10 May 1856 at age 18 to Jesus College, Cambridge, where his 1902 portrait hangs. He received his BA on 8 December 1859, his MA on 16 April 1863, and his DD on 19 May 1870.


=== Marriage ===
At St Peter and St Paul Church, Foxearth, Essex, on 18 August 1864, Wilkinson married Annie Margaret Green (Bedford 1844 – St Austell 1878). She was the daughter of coal and timber merchant Thomas Abbot Green JP (b. Great Gaddesden 13 April 1806) of Felmersham in Bedfordshire. Green spent ""several thousand pounds"" in 1842 in transforming his house Felmersham Grange into ""an Elizabethan-style mansion"", and he was a benefactor to the Church of St Peter, Pavenham. After Annie died, Wilkinson had steps and gates installed at the west side of the Church of St Mary, Felmersham, in her memory. In her published compilation of letters to friends and relatives, and journals relating to Zululand, Annie refers to her husband as ""E."" This is because Wilkinson used the forename Edward, rather than Thomas.The couple had three sons and four daughters: The eldest son was Edward H. (b. Ricklinghall 1866). Two of the daughters were Ethel Mary (Ricklinghall 1869 – Exmoor 1941) and Edith Howlett (Natal 1870 – Taunton 1960). Edith's son was Edward John Nelson Wallis C.B.E., governor of Khartoum. Then came Annie Howlett (Zululand ca.1872 – Oxford 1897), Fitzgerald Hooper (Transvaal ca.1875 – Ealing 19 September 1933), Irene Douglas (Newton Abbot 1876 – Sturminster Newton 1970), and World War I soldier Kenneth James Hooper (Newton Abbot 1878 – Taunton 1948). On 11 June 1890, Wilkinson's eldest daughter Ethel Mary Wilkinson married Rev. George Richard Mullens M.A. of East Woodhay. On 23 October 1907 Wilkinson conducted the marriage of his youngest daughter Irene Douglas Wilkinson and Arthur Frederick Wallis at St Giles Church, Taunton, where Irene was a Sunday school teacher. On the day of the marriage, the church and churchyard were decorated with flowers, the villagers attended, and the local children presented gifts to the couple.By 1895 Wilkinson was living at 42 Norfolk Square, Paddington, and asked for his name to be added to the electoral roll. In spite of his bishopric and the Reform Act 1867 his request was refused on the grounds that the house belonged to his sister Miss Wilkinson, so as her tenant he had no right to vote. His last home address was Bradford Court, Taunton.


=== Death ===
Wilkinson's last home was Bradford Court, Taunton, but he died of dysentery at 3:45 am on 23 October 1914 at Khartoum, while travelling in a non-clerical capacity between Cape Town and Cairo. Wilkinson's funeral took place on the day of his death, and he is buried at Khartoum. Since he had previously requested it, a stone Celtic cross was erected in the churchyard of St Mary's, Felmersham. The memorial's inscription says that it is also in memory of ""the dear ones lying around this churchyard"". He left £50,786, net £46,536. To his daughter Edith Howlett Wallis he left ""the ikon presented to him by the Metropolitan of Petrograd, and his episcopal pastoral staff, mitre and pectoral cross"".


== Career ==
In his Who's Who entry, Wilkinson listed his recreation as ""work"". However, before he was ordained ""he went to Italy with the intention of joining Garibaldi's English contingent and travelled over most of Europe."" Wilkinson was ordained deacon by Thomas Turton at Ely Cathedral in 1861, and priest on 16 March 1862. After a curacy at St Mary the Virgin's Church, Cavendish between March 1861 and 1864, Wilkinson had the curacy of St Mary's Church, Rickinghall Superior between 1864 and 1870. In 1870, after Bishop John Colenso ""was removed by Archbishop Gray of Capetown for preaching a liberal interpretation of the Bible to his Zulu converts"", he became the inaugural Bishop of Zululand. He held the post until 1876. On his return to England he was rector of St Michael Caerhays between 1878 and 1882, and then rector of St Katherine Coleman, London, between 1886 and 1911. For twenty-five years between 14 August 1886 and 1911 he was coadjutor bishop of London for north and central Europe, having been nominated by Frederick Temple.
On 30 December 1865, Wilkinson wrote a long letter to the Evening Mail about the need to establish local hospitals for infectious diseases, and the need to train nurses throughout the country. He described the previous year's epidemic of fevers in the parishes of Ricklinghall Superior and Inferior, and the despair of local families regarding how to assist a patient. He said, ""I have myself stepped in upon one occasion and found a mother of a large, grown-up family, and who, therefore, ought not to have been so entirely destitute of common sense, actually bending over her son, a lad of 16, who lay prostrate from a terrible attack of scarlet fever, and was begging him, in his insensible state, to open his clinched teeth to admit what the doctor had ordered her to give him; and there he would have laid, and died too, had I not most providentially called in the midst of the scene and let the liquid percolate from time to time between his teeth, from which time he happily slowly began to recover.""
On 13 March 1884, Wilkinson confirmed 111 children at All Saints Church in Faringdon. He read them a very long sermon on how to be good. Then the children were given another service and sermon by the vicar of Faringdon in the evening.

			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Zululand bishopric, 1870–1876 ===
In 1870, Wilkinson established himself at the mission station which had been built at KwaMagwaza, South Africa in 1859, when the Anglican Diocese of Zululand was created, following an agreement between Bishop John Colenso and King Mpande. By 1870, KwaMagwaza's chief missionary Archdeacon Robert Robertson was no longer cooperating with Colenso, who had been excommunicated, so on 8 May at the Whitehall Chapel Wilkinson had been inducted the inaugural Bishop of Zululand, ""a bishop for the Zulus and the tribes towards the Zambezi"". On his arrival in South Africa, Wilkinson was challenged by Colenso who did not want to leave. However he ""did good work in a difficult sphere"", and began his bishopric by establishing missions at Mpumalanga and Swaziland. Wilkinson resigned the post in 1876. In 1879 the Anglo-Zulu War broke out, the missions set up by Wilkinson were destroyed, and the British Army was defeated at Isandlwana. Due to the unrest, it was not until 1880 that Zululand had a second bishop, in the person of Douglas MacKenzie.


=== North and Central Europe bishopric, 1886–1911 ===
His next appointment was as coadjutor bishop of London, starting in March 1886. (He held this with the living of St Katherine Coleman.) During Wilkinson's era, the area encompassed by this diocese comprised ten nations: Russia, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, France, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Sweden and Norway, where at that period ruled three emperors and five kings, some of whom were Anglicans. These countries between them hosted two million annual tourists and seventy thousand expatriate British subjects. International trade annually brought two hundred and thirteen thousand British sailors to the ports. This position gave Wilkinson ""the oversight of 90 permanent chaplaincies in [the north and central European] region"", plus 200 seasonal chaplaincies. To visit them all meant travelling over fourteen thousand miles. He made 82 episcopal tours during this bishopric which was ""lying over an area eight times the size of Great Britain, and entailing very broken and trying travel by land and sea"". He oversaw the construction of twenty-one churches; for example on 22 April 1910, Wilkinson consecrated St. Boniface Church, Antwerp, and St Ursula's Church, Bern, on 20 September 1906. So after 25 years of this, in January 1911 he saw fit to retire at the age of 64 years. The following extract from his 1906 memoirs gives a partial insight into his concept of baptism and naming:  From Freiburg I went to Berne, staying with Mr. Leveson-Gower, attached to the Legation. I received his little son into the Church in the cathedral of Berne, the old dean being present. Mr. Leveson-Gower wished the additional name of Clarence to be given him, being descended from the Duke of that name, - said to have met his end in a butt of malmsey wine - but as the names of Osbert Charles Gresham had been already given him at his baptism, he had to be content with them!
In 1906, Wilkinson wrote to the Central Somerset Gazette to advocate the rebuilding of the Glastonbury Abbey ruins as a training college for missionaries. Nothing came of it, and in the event the Bath and Wells Diocesan Trust bought it in 1908; since then it has been protected as an archaeological site.On the second day of the 1907 Church Congress at Great Yarmouth Royal Aquarium, Wilkinson as Bishop of Northern and Central Europe read a long paper on the subject of The present condition of religious life on the continent of Europe and their lessons for the Church of England today. He declared that Germany was a religious nation, and that France was certainly not. He criticised the ""uncatholic claims of Rome to universal authority"". He said that Russia was a ""great Christianising power"" (he did not live to see the Russian Revolution). Those statements may appear judgmental, however he  also made one comment which may possibly define the middle road that he had to take in Africa, when the previous bishop, Colenso, had been excommunicated for questioning the literal truth of the Bible and for saying as Bishop of Natal, ""that his aim was to defeat sin rather than to punish those who sinned"", and when Wilkinson himself had to continue the mission while respecting the same African cultures. Wilkinson said, ""In ministering to our own countrymen we should take heed of the lessons of the Eastern Church: never to interfere; to exercise the utmost care in no way to do what Rome is ever doing, i.e. to proselytise.""


== Burgess Hill connection ==
Wilkinson was a close friend of Rev. W.R. Tindal-Atkinson of St Andrews Church, Burgess Hill. He used to visit periodically, and ""had taken a keen interest in the development of St. Andrew's parish and the building of St. Andrew's Church, the pulpit of which he occupied on several occasions. His visits were always associated with special and successful financial efforts on the part of the parishioners."" In the event, there were two new churches. The first, known as the tin oven due to its lack of summer insulation, was the 1899 corrugated iron church, bought second hand from East London, under the new curacy of Tindal-Atkinson. In 1900 the tin oven gained a sanctuary and basement. It continued as a church until 1908, after which it became the church hall. It burned down in 1959. The second, more substantial one, designed by Norman & Burt of Burgess Hill, had only a nave during Wilkinson's lifetime. The building was completed with the addition of a sanctuary in 1924, and as of 2020 was still in use as a church.


== Travel writing ==
 
A stuffy, desk-bound bishop, Wilkinson was not. The following extracts show something of the personality of the man. Here he recounts part of a journey between Bern and Lausanne in 1886: From Geneva I went to Thun, Interlaken, and Grindelwald, at each of which places we have season chaplaincies ; in fact, all Switzerland is studded – mountains, lake-sides, and valleys – with what I call my button mushroom churches, for they spring up all over that country, and sometimes almost in a night! On my way I ascended the Schynige Platte, from which a fine view of the Oberland is obtained. A farmer's son at Grindelwald told me that corn and apple trees will grow now in that district, whereas in his father's day, when the glaciers came much further down into the valley, neither could be cultivated. His father, who died this spring at the age of seventy-six, told him that this would take place again when the glaciers come down, as they are sure to do, in course of time. Sleeping at the Männlichen, then a rough hut far above the Wengen Alp Hotel, a grand panorama of the Jungfrau and the Oberland giants was obtained. The whole range, from the Titlis to Diablerets, lay in view. When in that neighbourhood I saw several rare birds, ring ousels, snow buntings, and, much to my delight, several Cornish choughs.

Wilkinson may have spent years in Africa, but he apparently liked snow sports. Here he is in 1895: I ran down to Thun one day from Berne and found it completely snowed up. Judging from appearances, all the inhabitants, save a few enterprising boys who were tobogganing down the deserted streets, in bed and asleep. As the boys did not invite me to join their sport, I returned to Berne by the next train.
This first bishop of Zululand was a sharer of stories. Here is one story that he heard from Frederick Robert St John, the chargé d'affaires at Berne, in 1895. It is not known whether either man embellished it: His most remarkable journey was from Pekin to England by land, long before the Trans–Siberian Railway was dreamed of – a wonderful feat for that day. It took him six weeks to reach the Siberian frontier, thence by sledge, with a young Russian officer carrying dispatches through Siberia to Nizhny Novgorod. They were eighteen days and nights in a sledge, travelling as hard as relays of three horses could lay their legs to the ground – and Russian horses can lay them to the ground. I remember Mr. J. Hubbard, of Petersburg, accustomed to Russian sledge travelling, telling me that upon a journey of only three or four days over the Ural Mountains he had to tie up his jaw tight to prevent his teeth being broken by the shocks over what are called roads! I was not surprised when Mr. St. John told me that he did not sleep for six months afterwards, and had never been altogether the same man since. The young Russian officer became delirious at the end of the first week, which terribly aggravated the difficulties and hardships of the journey.

Here is Wilkinson in the same winter of 1895.After a reception I endeavoured to walk out upon the Thun Road, where I found Mr.St John in almost as great a plight as in his journey from Pekin to London. He had got into a deep snowdrift returning from the reception to his house, and would have probably remained there till a thaw set in had I not come along and delivered him out of his distress ... An hotel somewhere up in the Jura was reported as buried fifteen feet deep. From many farm-houses tunnels had to be made to cow-houses, stables, and outbuildings to feed the cattle. Whole chalets were completely buried. In one, a man and his wife were found dead; their little child was alive under a table, warmed by a big dog which had curled itself round its young friend.

== Career ==


=== General Mills ===
After college, Blum worked with General Mills as a marketing executive. He worked at General Mills on both a national and international level. 
Blum helped to lead a start-up company called ""Cereal Partners Worldwide"" (CPW) in Switzerland; they had partnered up with Nestlé for an equal interest in the company, 50/50. Cereal Partners Worldwide is a large international company with sales exceeding $2,500,000 per year. Blum is credited with putting the first female athlete on a Wheaties box (Mary Lou Retton), and with putting the first African American athlete on a Wheaties box (Walter Payton).

Starting in 1994, Blum left General Mills and joined Olive Garden as its executive vice president of marketing. He was later promoted to  president. For the next eight years he oversaw Olive Garden's growth. Under Blum's leadership as the chief executive, Olive Garden achieved 57 consecutive quarters of same-restaurant sales increases, with continually increasing profits. The company's restaurant branch average increased by 67 percent during Blum's time there. In 2000, he won the MUFSO (Multi-Unit Foodservice Operators) Operator of the Year, a very high honor within the restaurant industry. In early 2002, he left Olive Garden.


=== Darden Restaurants ===
In March 2002, Blum moved further up the ladder to become Vice Chairman of Darden Restaurants, the owner of the Olive Garden restaurant chain. Because of his leadership, Olive Garden became Darden's most successful and recognizable company. Blum oversaw Olive Garden and Smokey Bones (considered one of Darden's most promising new restaurant companies). Darden was, and is, considered the largest casual dining restaurant company in the world, and Blum oversaw quality assurance, purchasing, and distribution for all the brand-name restaurants that Darden owned. Purchasing included the very fickle and mercurial business of global fish and seafood supply for  Red Lobster. Blum also evaluated up and coming restaurants for newly prospective acquisitions.


=== Burger King ===
Blum was named the CEO of Burger King in late 2002, having been hired to turn the declining company around. He was hired after Diageo sold Burger King Corporation to the private equity group of Texas Pacific Group, Bain Capital, and Goldman Sachs. During his tenure at Burger King, Blum oversaw the company's improvement in its financial performance. In his first year, profits doubled and positive growth was trending; the average restaurant sales increased from a loss of 7% to a growth of 4%. This proved advantageous when the company initiated an IPO in 2006.


=== Romano's Macaroni Grill ===
In late 2008, Romano's Macaroni Grill was suffering declines in sales, profits, and market share of the casual dining industry, and hired Blum as its CEO. He oversaw a turnaround in the same-restaurant sales from an annual loss of 11% to a 3% profit. Macaroni Grill's change in fortunes was partially based on a complete revamp the chain's menu, reorienting its cooking style on a more Mediterranean method of preparing and cooking food. In the first fifteen months, the changes to the menu not only improved the quality of the chain's products but also lowered its production costs. The caloric content of the products was reduced by 49% from the previous menu, along with a 59% reduction in fat and a 46% reduction in sodium. Blum's name for the change was called ""Quality up, Costs down."" As a result of these menu improvements, customer satisfaction rate for the chain grew. In May 2010, Nation's Restaurant News named Blum the Menu Master's Innovator of the Year in the restaurant industry for his accomplishments at Macaroni Grill.


=== FoodFirst Global Restaurants ===
Blum and Brazilian-based investment firm GP Investments, Ltd. formed FoodFirst Global Restaurants, Inc. and acquired its first brands, Brio Tuscan Grille™ (Brio) and Bravo Cucina Italiana™ (Bravo) on May 24, 2018. In early 2020, Blum resigned as Chairman and CEO but remains a Co-Owner of the company.

Vancouver area of British Columbia (Westham Island). Vancouver is a major shipping port, and is the most probable source area of the introduction
This is a small species (wingspan 15–20 mm) with grey or brown forewings with black basal areas which resemble a short cloak when the moth is at rest. The hindwings are uniform cream or grey. It flies at night in June and July [1] and is attracted to light.
The slightly hairy larva is reddish-brown with white marks along the back. It feeds on various rosaceous plants including apple, Cotoneaster, hawthorn, pear, Prunus, rowan and whitebeam. The species overwinters as a small larva.

Magnesium sulfide,"Magnesium sulfide is an inorganic compound with the formula MgS. It is a white crystalline material but often is encountered in an impure form that is brown and non-crystalline powder. It is generated industrially in the production of metallic iron.


== Preparation and general properties ==
MgS is formed by the reaction of sulfur or hydrogen sulfide with magnesium.  It crystallizes in the rock salt structure as its most stable phase, its zinc blende and wurtzite structures can be prepared by molecular beam epitaxy. The chemical properties of MgS resemble those of related ionic sulfides such as those of sodium, barium, or calcium. It reacts with oxygen to form the corresponding sulfate, magnesium sulfate.  MgS reacts with water to give hydrogen sulfide and magnesium hydroxide.


== Applications ==
In the BOS steelmaking process, sulfur is the first element to be removed. Sulfur is removed from the impure blast furnace iron by the addition of several hundred kilograms of magnesium powder by a lance. Magnesium sulfide is formed, which then floats on the molten iron and is removed.MgS is a wide band-gap direct semiconductor of interest as a blue-green emitter, a property that has been known since the early 1900s. The wide-band gap property also allows the use of MgS as photo-detector for short wavelength ultraviolet light.


== Occurrence ==
Aside from being a component of some slags, MgS is a rare nonterrestrial mineral niningerite detected in some meteorites.  It is also a solid soution component along with CaS and FeS in oldhamite. MgS is also found in the circumstellar envelopes of certain evolved carbon stars, i. e., those with C/O  > 1.


== Safety ==
MgS evolves hydrogen sulfide upon contact with moisture.

== Background ==
Rice was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Irish immigrants. His mother died when he was four, and he and his brother were sent to Ireland to be raised by his paternal grandmother, in a large extended family home along the seafront in Bellurgan, County Louth. Seven years later he returned to the United States.
In 1934, after studies at Duquesne University and Saint Vincent Seminary, he was ordained into the priesthood in the Diocese of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he served for seven decades.  His brother Patrick was also an ordained priest in Pittsburgh and a canon lawyer. His cousin, also called Patrick Rice (June 1918 – June 8, 2010), was an ordained priest in Dublin and similarly elevated to the Canonry.


== Contributions in Pittsburgh ==
In 1937, Rice founded St. Joseph's House of Hospitality with two other Roman Catholic priests, Carl Hensler and George Barry O'Toole. Also that year, the three priests formed the Catholic Radical Alliance.During the Great Depression, Rice began his activism in social causes and especially in the American labor movement. Rice was mentored by Pittsburgh's original labor priest Father James Cox, and as a leader of the Catholic Radical Alliance, was involved in strikes against the H.J. Heinz Company.He met Dorothy Day and was a friend of Philip Murray, founder of the Steel Workers Organizing Committee and president of the Congress of Industrial Organizations.Rice helped form the Association of Catholic Trade Unionists.

Rice was an early organizer and contributor to National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam, a coalition of antiwar activists, participating in the initial Spring Mobilization to End the War in Vietnam demonstrations, held in New York City in April 1967. He opposed America's involvement in the Vietnam War in 1969, and supported workers in Pittsburgh when they lost their jobs and livelihood as the steel industry closed in the 1980s.

Over the Limit (2010),"The 2010 Over the Limit was the inaugural Over the Limit professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on May 23, 2010, at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Michigan. The name ""Over the Limit"" was a reference to its main event match being contested as an ""I Quit"" match. Over the Limit replaced WWE's previously annual May PPV, Judgment Day.
Nine matches took place at the event, eight of which were broadcast live on pay-per-view. In the main event, which was the main match from Raw, John Cena faced Batista for the WWE Championship in an ""I Quit"" match, while Big Show versus World Heavyweight Champion Jack Swagger was the main match from SmackDown. Matches on the undercard included Randy Orton against Edge, CM Punk facing Rey Mysterio, and Drew McIntyre defending SmackDown's Intercontinental Championship against Kofi Kingston. Other championships defended at the event were Raw's WWE Divas Championship and the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship, which was available to both brands.
The event drew 197,000 pay-per-view buys, and was attended live by 11,000 people. Reviews for the event were generally negative, with reviewers criticizing the endings of the matches, stoppages for blood, and predictable match results. Five wrestlers sustained legitimate injuries during the course of the show, being Batista, John Cena, CM Punk, Randy Orton, and Ted DiBiase Jr..


== Production ==


=== Background ===
World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) had previously ran an annual May pay-per-view (PPV) titled Judgment Day. In 2010, WWE discontinued Judgment Day and replaced it with a new PPV titled Over the Limit. The event was held on May 23, 2010, at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Michigan and featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brands. The name ""Over the Limit"" was a reference to its main event match being contested as an ""I Quit"" match.


=== Storylines ===
Over the Limit involved different wrestlers from scripted feuds, plots, and storylines that played out on WWE's television programs. Wrestlers portrayed a hero or a villain as they followed a series of events that built tension, and culminated into a wrestling match or series of matches.The main feud from the Raw brand heading into Over the Limit was between John Cena and Batista over the WWE Championship, and had been going on for several months. Cena retained the WWE Championship against Batista at the Extreme Rules pay-per-view in a Last Man Standing match, by taping Batista's ankles to the ringpost to ensure he could not stand up by the count of ten. The next night on Raw, Batista defeated Randy Orton and Sheamus to become the number one contender to the championship and earn a rematch against Cena. On the May 3 episode of Raw, they competed in a Beat the Clock challenge to determine the stipulation for their match. Batista defeated Daniel Bryan in 5:06, but Cena defeated Wade Barrett in 4:32 to win the challenge and the right to name the stipulation. The following week, Cena announced that the match would be an ""I Quit"" match.The predominant feud from the SmackDown brand was between Jack Swagger and Big Show, over Swagger's World Heavyweight Championship. As part of the 2010 WWE Draft, Big Show was drafted to SmackDown, where he was named the number one contender upon his debut on April 30. Over the next several weeks, Big Show chokeslammed Swagger through the announce table, and interrupted a promo on the May 14 episode of SmackDown, in which Swagger was boasting about his accomplishments. As part of the segment, Big Show destroyed Swagger's trophies and memorabilia. The following week, Big Show mocked Swagger in promos throughout the show and distracted Swagger during Swagger's match with Kofi Kingston, allowing Kingston to win.
As part of the 2010 WWE Draft on April 26, Edge was drafted to the Raw brand. Later that night, Edge interfered in a match to determine the number one contender to the WWE Championship, spearing Randy Orton and preventing Orton from receiving a WWE Championship match. The following week, Edge hosted an edition of his talk show, The Cutting Edge, with Orton as his special guest. During the show, Edge justified his actions by saying he was trying to make an impact, and attempted to convince Orton to reform Rated-RKO, their former tag team. Instead Orton attacked Edge. The following week, Orton defeated Edge and Ted DiBiase Jr. in a handicap match, which led to ""Pick Your Poison"" matches on the May 17 episode of Raw, where Edge and Orton picked each other's opponents for the night. Edge faced The Undertaker, and lost intentionally by countout, while Orton faced Jack Swagger, and lost by disqualification when Edge interfered.The rivalry between Rey Mysterio and CM Punk was continued from several previous pay-per-views. After months of feuding, Mysterio challenged Punk to a Straight Edge Society Pledge vs. Hair match at Over the Limit. Had Punk won, Mysterio would have joined the Straight Edge Society, Punk's faction which promoted the straight edge lifestyle. Had Mysterio won however, Punk agreed to have his head shaved. On May 14, Mysterio and Punk faced each other in a singles match, but the Straight Edge Society (Luke Gallows, Serena, and a mystery masked man) interfered and attacked Mysterio. The following week, Mysterio interrupted an initiation ceremony, in which Punk was shaving the heads of three men to induct them into the Straight Edge Society, and mocked Punk, claiming everyone would be laughing at Punk when he was shaved bald at Over the Limit. Later that night, Mysterio teamed with Montel Vontavious Porter to defeat Punk and Gallows in a tag team match. SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long announced That The Straight Edge Society will be Banned From Ringside during the match at the Pay-per-view

Another feud was over the WWE Intercontinental Championship between the defending champion Drew McIntyre and Kofi Kingston. SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long stripped McIntyre of the championship and fired him for repeatedly attacking Matt Hardy. Long set up a tournament to determine the new champion, in which Christian and Kingston qualified for the final by defeating Cody Rhodes and Dolph Ziggler. The following week, on the May 14 episode of SmackDown, Kingston defeated Christian to win the tournament and the championship. Immediately following the match, however, McIntyre presented Long with a letter from the WWE Chairman Vince McMahon, which stated that McIntyre had been reinstated to the roster and was still recognized as the Intercontinental Champion. As a result, WWE's official website announced that McIntyre would defend the championship against tournament winner Kingston.The team of Chris Jericho and The Miz had begun feuding with The Hart Dynasty (Tyson Kidd and David Hart Smith) over the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship. The Miz's feud with The Hart Dynasty had begun while The Miz was one-half of the Unified Tag Team Champions with Big Show. During the Draft episode of Raw, The Hart Dynasty defeated ShoMiz to win the championship, which led to Big Show turning on The Miz. The following week, The Miz and Jericho, another former tag team partner of Big Show, teamed up to attack The Hart Dynasty. Jericho went on to defeat Smith to earn a championship match for himself and The Miz at Over the Limit.After WrestleMania XXVI, Ted DiBiase had debuted a new gimmick of an arrogant millionaire, similar to his father (Ted DiBiase, Sr.)'s old gimmick. On the April 5 episode of Raw, DiBiase was given possession of the Million Dollar Championship and access to a trust fund by his father. DiBiase then began looking for a ""Virgil"", a manservant like his father used to have. He offered the position to R-Truth, who refused, leading to a feud between the two. After losing a match to John Morrison, DiBiase attacked him, prompting R-Truth to interfere and save Morrison. In retaliation, DiBiase paid The Colóns to attack R-Truth the following week.In the only women's match scheduled on the card, Eve defended the WWE Divas Championship against the former champion, Maryse. Eve had won the championship on the April 12 episode of Raw, and in the weeks that followed she was attacked by Maryse, who was attempting to get revenge.


== Event ==
Prior to the pay-per-view, Montel Vontavious Porter defeated Chavo Guerrero Jr. in a dark match.


=== Preliminary matches ===
The first match that was aired as part of the pay-per-view was Drew McIntyre defending his Intercontinental Championship against Kofi Kingston. Kingston took the early advantage, by performing a suicide dive to the outside of the ring on McIntyre. McIntyre threw Kingston in the ringpost, and went on the offense. Kingston was able to counter McIntyre's ""Future Shock"" DDT, and perform his finishing move, the S.O.S, to pin McIntyre for the victory and the championship. Following the match, McIntyre demanded that Teddy Long go out to the ring and reverse the decision, but instead McIntyre was attacked by Matt Hardy, who McIntyre had attacked on several occasions in the prior weeks.
The next match was a singles match between Ted DiBiase, who was accompanied by Virgil, and R-Truth. In the early stages of the match, Virgil caused a distraction, allowing DiBiase to take the advantage by performing a reverse neckbreaker and throwing R-Truth into the barricade at ringside. R-Truth was able to counter a move from the top rope, and went on to win the match by utilising his ""Lie Detector"" finishing move (a corkscrew flying forearm smash).The third match on the card was a Straight Edge Society pledge vs. hair match, between CM Punk and Rey Mysterio. For this match, the other Straight Edge Society members (Serena and Luke Gallows) were banned from ringside. Early on in the match, Punk threw Mysterio headfirst out of the ring into the barber chair at ringside. Punk had suffered a cut to the head prior to the exchange, and while Mysterio was on the floor, the match was halted so that the blood could be cleaned up. While Punk's wound was being attended, he dropkicked Mysterio, who was on the ring apron, and began attacking him on the floor to restart the match. After Mysterio missed a splash from the top rope, Punk went to pin him, but Mysterio was able to perform a crucifix cradle on Punk for the victory. The other Straight Edge Society members attacked Mysterio after the match, but he was saved by Kane, which allowed Mysterio to handcuff Punk to the ring ropes and shave his head.A tag team match for the Unified Tag Team Championship followed, between the champions The Hart Dynasty (Tyson Kidd and David Hart Smith), who were accompanied by their manager Natalya, and the team of Chris Jericho and The Miz. The Hart Dynasty took the early advantage, but Jericho and The Miz were able to isolate both Smith and Kidd in the ring at different points in the match, wearing them down. Natalya interfered by tripping up Jericho while The Miz had the referee distracted. The Hart Dynasty were able to capitalise, and performed the Hart Attack on The Miz for the pinfall victory.The fifth match was between Edge and Randy Orton. Edge took early control of the match by driving Orton into the barricade outside the ring. Orton was able to recover, and performed a rope hung DDT on Edge. While setting up for his finishing move, the RKO, Orton appeared to injure his arm, and went outside the ring in an attempt to recover. Edge followed him, trying to perform the spear, but Orton was able to avoid it, and Edge hit the barricade. Neither man was able to return to the ring before the count of ten, and as a result, the match ended in a double countout.
The first major match of the night was between the World Heavyweight Champion Jack Swagger and his challenger, Big Show. Big Show dominated the match, with Swagger getting very little offense. As a result, Swagger got frustrated and hit Big Show with the World Heavyweight Championship title belt, and was disqualified. After the match, Swagger attacked Big Show with a steel chair, but Big Show was able to stop him with a chokeslam. Big Show then performed his knockout punch on Swagger, before leaving the area.The penultimate match on the card saw Eve defend the WWE Divas Championship against Maryse. Maryse took the early advantage, but when she threw Eve outside the ring, and attempted to kick her, she kicked the ringpost instead, allowing Eve to take control with a series of dropkicks. Eve performed a standing moonsault and a sunset flip for a near-fall. Maryse countered a rolling senton splash attempt by Eve and went for her finishing move, the French Kiss; that was countered by Eve for the pin, who retained her championship.


=== Main event ===
The main event was John Cena versus Batista for the WWE Championship in an ""I Quit"" match, where the object of the match is to force an opponent to say ""I Quit"". As the bell rang to signal the start of the match Batista gave Cena the chance to quit immediately, but Cena refused and hit Batista with the microphone. Despite this, Batista was able to take control, and locked in a submission hold, but Cena refused to say ""I quit"". Cena eventually countered the move into his own submission hold, the STF, and Batista passed out. As he had not said the words ""I Quit"" however, he had to be revived so the match could continue. Batista fought back, and was able to powerslam Cena through the announce table. As Cena was bleeding, the match was briefly halted so his wound could receive attention. The two fought into the crowd before ending up near the entrance ramp, with Batista hitting Cena with a steel chair. On the entrance stage, Batista got into a car, which had been placed on the stage for decoration, and attempted to run over Cena. Cena avoided it, and was able to pull Batista out of the car and slam him onto it. Cena performed his Attitude Adjustment on Batista onto the car, but when Batista refused to quit, Cena went for the move again. When it became clear that Cena was going to hit the Attitude Adjustment from off the car and onto the stage, Batista quit, making Cena the winner, but Cena performed the Attitude Adjustment again anyway, sending Batista through the stage to the floor. As Cena was celebrating retaining the championship, he was attacked by Sheamus to end the show.


== Reception ==
The event received generally negative reviews. Writing for Canadian Online Explorer's wrestling section, Matt Bishop derided the show, calling it ""one of the worst WWE pay-per-view events in a long time"" and awarded the show 5.5 out of ten.Most of the negative comments centered around the following World Heavyweight Championship match, which ended in disqualification immediately following a double countout in the preceding Orton-Edge match due to injury. Bishop awarded the match 2.5 out of ten and said that the match ""hurt the show in a big, big way"". Kevin Eck of The Baltimore Sun also criticized the booking of the finish, remarking that ""Swagger came off looking like anything but a credible champion"". Wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer also criticized the World Heavyweight Championship match, remarking that it was ""almost an insult as a PPV main event"". Bishop stated that the show was ""hampered by several stoppages for blood"" and a predictable ending to the main event between Cena and Batista.Despite the generally negative reviews, the Mysterio-Punk match was highly praised. Bishop awarded the match 8.5 out of ten, and stated it was one of two matches, along with the Tag Team Championship bout, that were not ""underwhelming in every aspect"". Eck agreed, calling the Punk-Mysterio match the ""most compelling match on the card"" and stated that the Tag Team Championship match was ""well-worked"".11,000 people attended Over the Limit at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, resulting in a gate of approximately $675,000. In August 2010, WWE reported that the event had received 197,000 pay-per-view buys. The DVD of the event contained extras including a match between Bret Hart and The Miz for the WWE United States Championship and several promos from the weeks preceding the event.


== Aftermath ==
During the event, five wrestlers suffered legitimate injuries. Randy Orton dislocated his shoulder while Ted DiBiase suffered a concussion, and although they both appeared on Raw the following night, they did not wrestle. CM Punk required 13 staples to close the wound in his forehead he sustained during his match with Mysterio. Batista suffered a back and tailbone injury during his match with John Cena, who himself suffered a laceration and lost a tooth.On the episode of Raw following Over the Limit, Bret Hart was announced as the new Raw General Manager. During Batista's promo at the beginning of the show, Hart interrupted and told him that if he wanted a rematch against Cena, he would have to qualify for the fatal four-way match at the Fatal 4-Way pay-per-view in June. Batista refused to wrestle, citing his injuries, and as a result Hart awarded the match to his opponent Orton by forfeit. Following Hart's decision, Batista quit WWE. This storyline was put in place as Batista was legitimately leaving WWE to pursue acting and a career in mixed martial arts.Apart from Orton qualifying via forfeit, the other qualifying matches for the WWE Championship fatal four-way match saw Sheamus defeat Mark Henry and Edge defeat Jericho and Cena in a triple threat match.On the May 28 episode of SmackDown, SmackDown General Manager Teddy Long announced a fatal four-way match for the World Heavyweight Championship would be taking place at the Fatal 4-Way pay-per-view. As the defending champion Jack Swagger automatically was part of the match, and as a result of his win by disqualification, Big Show received automatic entry. Later in the show, both The Undertaker and CM Punk qualified for the match as well, by defeating Rey Mysterio and Kane respectively. During his qualification match against Kane, Punk wore a mask to the ring in order to hide his newly-shaven head. During his match with Mysterio, The Undertaker suffered a concussion, broken orbital bone and broken nose and the following week, was deemed unable to participate in the match. WWE replaced him in the match by devising a storyline in which The Undertaker was found in a ""vegetative state"" by his on-screen half brother Kane on the following episode of SmackDown. That same broadcast, a battle royal to decide who would replace The Undertaker at the Fatal 4-Way pay-per-view was won by Rey Mysterio.At the beginning of the May 28 episode of SmackDown, Drew McIntyre made Teddy Long read out a letter from the WWE Chairman Vince McMahon, which stated that as a result of attacking McIntyre at Over the Limit, Matt Hardy had been suspended without pay until further notice. On the same episode, McIntyre simultaneously continued his feud with Kofi Kingston by teaming with Jack Swagger in a loss to Kingston and The Big Show.A second Over the Limit was held the following year, thus establishing the event as WWE's annual May PPV. Additionally, in April 2011, WWE ceased using its full name with the ""WWE"" abbreviation becoming an orphaned initialism. Over the Limit would be a short-lived PPV, however, as it was discontinued after its 2012 event and was replaced by Battleground in 2013.

Indian Tower,"The Indian Tower is a lookout tower that sits at the highest point of the original 5,000 acres (20 km2) of Nazareth, Pennsylvania.
The original structure was a pavilion called ""the summer house"" built in 1867 by John Jordan, Jr. Jordan later donated $200 to the Moravian Historical Society to replace the pavilion with the present-day tower, which was completed in 1916. The Indian Tower is commonly thought to have been a lookout for hostile Native Americans. In actuality, the local Native Americans had assimilated in Pennsylvania, and the tower received its name from the Moravian Graveyard it overlooks, which contains some Indian burials. The Moravian Graveyard was in use from 1744 to 1762. However, out of the 67 people buried there, only four were Native Americans. The original Indians would have been from the nearby village of Welagamika. The height of the tower is 30 feet. The tower has been used for many purposes: as a civil defense lookout during World War II, as a repeater station for emergency services, and also as a place to rest and reflect.

Joshua 4,"Joshua 4 is the fourth chapter of the Book of Joshua in the Hebrew Bible or in the Old Testament of the Christian Bible. According to Jewish tradition  the book was attributed to Joshua, with additions by the high priests Eleazar and Phinehas, but modern scholars view it as part of the Deuteronomistic History, which spans the books of Deuteronomy to 2 Kings, attributed to nationalistic and devotedly Yahwistic writers during the time of the reformer Judean king Josiah in 7th century BCE. This chapter focuses on the Israelites crossing the Jordan River westward into the land of Canaan under the leadership of Joshua, a part of a section comprising Joshua 1:1–5:12 about the entry to the land of Canaan.

== Twelve Stones from the Jordan (4:1–18) ==
The crossing of the Jordan narrative (3:1–5:1) consists of several units that backtrack and overlap, with a number of elements recounted more than once (e.g. the selection of men to carry the stones, 3:12; 4:2; the setting up of the stones, 4:8–9, 20). In contrast to chapter 3, this chapter places more emphasis on the setting of twelve stones during and after the crossing. Just as the directive the priest in Joshua 3:6 is only resolved in Joshua 3:16, the directive to the twelve men, one from each tribe of Israel, in Joshua 3:12 is clarified in Joshua 4:2 that they are to carry stones from the midst of the Jordan to the place of destination for the camp. The account is also instituting an act of worship for all future generations (verses 6–7, 21–22), similar to the narrative of the first Passover (cf. Exodus 12:24–27). Joshua's importance (verses 10–14) echoes earlier passage (3:7–8). The priests remained in the middle of dry river bed with the ark until the complete crossing of the people and the ceremonies with the stones (4:10), before finally ascended to the west bank and when they did the river resumes its normal flow (4:15–18).


=== Verse 1 ===
And it came to pass, when all the people had completely crossed over the Jordan, that the Lord spoke to Joshua, saying:Hebrew text (read from right to left): 

ויהי כאשר־תמו כל־הגוי לעבור את־הירדן פ ויאמר יהוה אל־יהושע לאמר׃In the middle of the verse in Hebrew text, after the phrase ""all the people had completely crossed over the Jordan"", there is a petuhah (open paragraph sign) from an old pre-Masoretic mark, which the Masorites have retained, marking the end of the previous paragraph and the beginning of a new parashah or ""paragraph"". The next phrase (in literal Hebrew translation: ""and spoke YHWH to Joshua, saying""), together with verses 2, 3 and 4 (""and Joshua called the twelve men""), form a 'parenthesis' (as also pointed out by, among others, Kimchi and Calvin), joined together here by consecutive waw (a form of historical Hebrew composition), that is supposed to be arranged in logical order with their proper subordination to one another to be rendered as ""Then Joshua called the twelve men — as Jehovah had commanded him, saying, 'Take you twelve men out of the people,' etc. — and said to them,"" etc.


== Camp at Gilgal (4:19–24) ==
The date of the Jordan crossing is significant, the tenth day of the 'first month' in relation to the Passover celebration, when the paschal lamb was set apart for the feast (Exodus 12:2–3), thus linking the Exodus (the crossing of the Reed Sea), and the entry into the land of promise. The stones taken from the river are set up in the Israelite camp at Gilgal (verse 20), for the purpose of the demonstration of God's power so 'that all the peoples of the earth might know it', thus pointing towards the future triumphs of YHWH, which greatly terrifying the inhabitants of the land (Joshua 5:1).


=== Verse 19 ===
And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.""The tenth day of the first month"":  Four days before the Passover, and the very day when the paschal lamb is required to be set apart (the first time exactly forty years ago: Exodus 12:3 ""a lamb for an house""). The first month is elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible called ""Abib"", that is, “the month of green ears” (Exodus 13:4; Exodus 23:15; Deuteronomy 16:1), and subsequently after the captivity in Babylon is called “Nisan” (Nehemiah 2:1; Esther 3:7).
""Gilgal"": from a Hebrew word denoting 'a circular encampment', proleptically used in Joshua 4:19 and Joshua 4:20 to call the first location of the Israelite camp after crossing the Jordan River (cf. Joshua 5:9). It was ""about five miles"" (50 stadia, according to Josephus) ""from the river banks"" and about a mile and a quarter from Jericho, according to Josephus. Joshua 5:3 describes it as a rising ground, but it is difficult to identify the spot in modern times, since there never existed any town or village there.

== History ==


=== Jack E. Christensen ===
Jack E. Christensen (1949–2021) was an award-winning American rose breeder, garden writer and biology teacher from Southern California. Christensen was born in Glendale, California in 1949. He showed an early interest in nature and gardening when he was very young. In high school, Christensen won a scholarship to University of California, Los Angeles. He initially planned to become a doctor, but later changed his mind and transferred to Cal Poly Pomona to study Botany.Christensen spent most of his horticultural career at Armstrong Nurseries in Southern California. He progressed through the company until he became a hybridizer of roses and fruit trees, and vice-president of research. During his career, he developed over 80 new rose cultivars, including 'Henry Fonda', 'Cricket', 'White Lightnin'' and 'Gold Medal'. Christensen was the youngest hybridizer to win an All-America Rose Selections (AARS) in 1986, with his hybrid tea, 'Voodoo'.


=== 'Fragrant Plum' ===
'Fragrant Plum' was developed by Jack Christensen from a cross between 'Shocking Blue' and a secong cross between 'Blue Nile' x (  'Ivory Tower' x 'Angel Face'). The new rose cultivar was introduced in the United States by Armstrong Roses in 1982. The cultivar was used to hybridize one child plant, 'Flamingo Dancer'.

As a result of these breaches in the rules, Dunfermline Athletic were to be expelled from the competition and Stenhousemuir were to progress their stead. However following an appeal by the club, a committee decided that expulsion from the competition was too harsh a punishment and wasn't merited by what the club's management described as ""honest errors"".  The club were given a reprieve along with fines and forfeits of benefits totalling around £30,000. Furthermore, the result of the game was overturned was replayed at Ochilview Park to decide which team progressed in the competition.

Tina Howe,"Mabel Davis ""Tina"" Howe (November 21, 1937 – August 28, 2023) was an American playwright. In a career that spanned more than four decades, Howe's best-known works include Museum, The Art of Dining, Painting Churches, Coastal Disturbances, and Pride's Crossing.
Her plays won numerous awards, including the 1998 New York Drama Critics Circle Award for Best Play for Pride's Crossing, which was also a finalist for the 1997 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Coastal Disturbances was nominated for the 1987 Tony Award for Best Play.


== Early life ==
Mabel Davis Howe was born in Manhattan on November 21, 1937. Howe came from a literary family. Her grandfather, Mark Antony De Wolfe Howe, published over 50 books and won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography in 1925. Her father Quincy Howe wrote and broadcast the evening news on CBS Radio from 1942 to 1947, and then on ABC television. He was the author of the three-volume history, A World History of Our Own Times. Her uncle, Mark DeWolfe Howe, taught constitutional law at Harvard Law School and was Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.'s law clerk and biographer. Her aunt, Helen Howe, was a successful monologist and novelist. Howe was called Tina since her childhood, so when she was eighteen, she changed her name from Mabel Howe to Tina Howe.Howe's family placed an emphasis on its members' reading and writing: ""Thanksgivings and family occasions were always about, 'What are you reading, what are you writing, what are you working on, what poetry are you interested in?'"" When Howe was ill with hepatitis, her father visited her every day in the hospital, reading James Joyce's Ulysses to her during his lunch break.Howe graduated from Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, New York, in 1959. As an undergraduate, she wrote her first play, Closing Time; her classmate, Jane Alexander, later directed and acted in it.After graduation, she and Alexander traveled to Europe; Alexander to act and study mathematics at the University of Edinburgh and Howe to study philosophy at Sorbonne University and write. When Howe saw Eugène Ionesco's La Cantatrice Chauve at the Théâtre de la Huchette, ""It changed my life"", she said. ""It was like a bolt of lightning going through my head.""Following her return from Europe, Howe did graduate work at Columbia University Teacher's College and Chicago Teachers College. She started teaching high school in Monona Grove, Wisconsin, while her husband (teacher and writer Norman Levy) was doing graduate work and then in Bath, Maine, which is where she said she learned her craft through running the school's drama department, a position she agreed to take if they would produce her plays.


== Career ==


=== Themes and style ===
Literary critic and novelist C. W. E. Bigsby wrote that ""art is plainly a central point of reference"" for Howe, noting those themes in Painting Churches and Coastal Disturbances, and added that ""food and consumption"" are also important themes in her work. In his book Contemporary American Playwrights, Bigsby wrote that she had a ""commitment to experimentation"" and quotes Howe as saying said that she is ""firmly entrenched in the Absurdist tradition."" Frank Rich, in his New York Times review of Painting Churches commented that the play ""is in the dreamiest impressionistic spirit."" The Variety reviewer of Painting Churches also noted that the play is a ""group portrait painted in a soft, impressionistic style.""The CurtainUp reviewer of Coastal Disturbances wrote of Howe's work: ""Like all of Howe's work, the play's charm stems from its quirky characters. In this case joie de vie, despair, love, lust, anger and fear come and go like the waves hitting the shore in foamy bursts or gentle ripples."" Writing in the Sarah Lawrence Magazine, Celia McGerr Regan described Howe's authorial voice: ""Howe developed a voice that has been variously described as farcical and absurd, impressionistic and airy, graceful and perceptive, lyric and literate, vivid and language-driven, whimsical and demented. Odd things happen in the face of the recognizable: Trees grow up inside and through a New York State farmhouse (One Shoe Off)...""Ben Brantley in reviewing Birth and After Birth for The New York Times, observed ""The suggestion is of a natural world that thwarts and ultimately devours the ambitions and pretensions of the civilized. This is a theme that Ms. Howe would develop in later works, sometimes artfully (Coastal Disturbances), sometimes clumsily (One Shoe Off), but always in a style that was distinctively her own.""Howe noted about her time in Paris: ""The most profound thing that happened to me that year ...  was seeing The Bald Soprano by Ionesco. That exploded me all over the place."" Ionesco, Beckett and Pirandello continued to be her heroes.Howe was a great admirer of Glenn Gould, saying, ""I write my plays to Glenn Gould. I cook the kids' spaghetti dinners to Glenn Gould. I pay the bills to Glenn Gould.""


=== Full-length plays ===
Howe's first full-length play to receive a professional production was The Nest, which premiered in summer 1969 at the Act IV Theater in Provincetown, Massachusetts. It was directed by Larry Arrick and the cast included Sally Kirkland and Richard Jordan among others. From Provincetown, the show was transferred Off-Broadway to New York's Mercury Theater, opening on April 9, 1970.Howe later recalled, ""My first play, 'The Nest,' was about courtship and how women compete with each other to land a husband. That play closed [off-Broadway] in one night."" The play follows the trials of three young women competing for husbands at a dinner party, and during the course of the play, one of the women takes off her clothes and dives into a huge wedding cake, and is licked clean by one of the male guests. The Nest, Clive Barnes of The New York Times wrote in his review, ""must be on any reasonable short list of the worst plays I have ever seen.""Her play Museum, with a cast of 55 characters, premiered at the Los Angeles Actors' Theatre on April 29, 1976, and was then presented Off-Broadway by Joseph Papp at the Public Theater, opening in February 1978, in a production directed by Max Stafford-Clark. A cast of 18 actors played a total of 44 characters. The play takes place at a group art show of three contemporary artists, titled The Broken Silence.  The Public Theater production featured Dianne Wiest, Kathryn Grody and Larry Bryggman. A CurtainUp reviewer noted that Howe ""explained in her author's note for the play's premiere at the Shakespeare Festival, her large cast of characters was created to provide directors and producers with endless staging possibilities."" In her note in the script (published by Samuel French), Howe wrote: ""It is my hope that any group wanting to present Museum use the large cast size as a challenge and not as a restriction. The play was written to serve the versatility of actors.""The play was revived Off-Broadway by the Keen Company in 2002, directed by Carl Forsman. In his Village Voice review, Michael Feingold wrote, ""This is the most enchantingly tesserated play ever written … . If Mozart had been a TV producer, this is what a 'Candid Camera' segment on art might have looked like.""The Art of Dining is set in an exclusive restaurant (and home) moving from the kitchen of the chef/owner, to the dining room, where her husband is the maitre d', to the individual tables of the characters, observing their action and interplay while waiting for and eating their meals. The play was first presented Off-Broadway by Joseph Papp at the Public Theater in December 1979, in a production directed by A. J. Antoon with a cast featuring Kathy Bates, Ron Rifkin and Dianne Wiest, who went on to win the 1980 Clarence Derwent Award and Obie Award.Howe herself won an Obie Award in 1983 for distinguished playwriting for her plays The Art of Dining, Museum and Painting Churches. From New York, The Art of Dining moved to a run at the Kennedy Center.Howe's next play, Painting Churches, premiered on February 8, 1983, at Second Stage Theater, under the direction of Carole Rothman. The cast included Marian Seldes, Frances Conroy and Donald Moffat. It transferred to the off-Broadway Lambs Theater where it ran from November 22, 1983, through May 20, 1984, playing 206 performances. In this production Marian Seldes was joined by Elizabeth McGovern and George Martin. Painting Churches won several Outer Critics Circle Awards, including Best Off-Broadway Play, Best Actress (Marian Seldes) and the John Gassner Playwriting Award. The play was also a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in Drama.In 1986, Painting Churches was filmed for PBS's American Playhouse, directed by Jack O'Brien. That cast included Sada Thompson, Donald Moffat and Roxanne Hart. It was revived off-Broadway by the Keen Company in March 2012, directed by Carl Forsman, starring Kathleen Chalfant, John Cunningham, and Kate Turnbull.In November 1986, Howe's next play, Coastal Disturbances premiered at Second Stage, under the direction of Carole Rothman. The play was set on a private New England beach. Annette Bening and Tim Daly led the cast. The play was transferred to the Circle-in-the-Square Theater on Broadway in March 1987. It was nominated for a Tony award for Best Play along with Carole Rothman for Best Direction and Annette Bening for Best Actress. Frank Rich of The New York Times hailed it as ""Hilarious"", ""erotic"" and ""intoxicating"".This was followed by Approaching Zanzibar, which shows the Blossom family traveling across the United States to visit Olivia, a sick relative. The play premiered at the Second Stage Theatre on April 8, 1989, directed by Carole Rothman, and starred Jane Alexander as Charlotte Blossom, Harris Yulin as her husband, Angela Goethals as her daughter and Bethel Leslie as her dying aunt. The play was produced at the Southwark Playhouse, London, in August 1997. The reviewer for The Independent wrote: ""... a zany, expertly mimed sequence throws the tensions of cooped-up family car travel into rollicking relief when, in fantasy, the parents and children swap roles. But, like so much off-Broadway fare, the play insists on coating the pill of pain in the sickly sugar of false reassurance.""One Shoe Off opened Off-Broadway in April 1993 in a Second Stage Theatre production at the Public Theater.  The Variety reviewer described the play as ""the dining-room play that dissolves in an emotive crossfire of accusation, revelation and reconciliation"", ""offbeat, sometimes ferociously funny"" with an ""over-the-top tone"".Her play Pride's Crossing, described by Playbill as a ""family-inspired memory play"" was produced Off-Broadway at Lincoln Center from December 7, 1997, to April 5, 1998 after an engagement at the Old Globe Theatre (San Diego) in 1997. The play was revived Off-Broadway in 2004. She received the New York Drama Critic's Circle Award for Best Play in 1998 for this play.Rembrandt's Gift premiered at the Humana Festival at Actors Theatre of Louisville in 2002, directed by John Rando and starring Penny Fuller and a revised version was produced by the Madison Repertory Theatre (Wisconsin) in September 2005. The three person play focuses on an ""unlikely, poignant and very funny visit by the great 17th-century Dutch painter Rembrandt van Rijn.Howe wrote English translations of Eugène Ionesco's The Bald Soprano and The Lesson, which were produced at the Atlantic Theater Company in September 2004. The plays were directed by Carl Forsman and featured Jan Maxwell, John Ellison Conlee, Michael Countryman and 
Robert Stanton.The Atlantic Theater Company presented Birth and After Birth Off-Broadway at the Linda Gross Theater, opening in September 2006 in previews. Described by Playbill as ""a play about parenting"", the play was written in 1972; it was directed by Atlantic associate artistic director Christian Parker. The play was first presented at the Wilma Theatre (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) in September 1995, after being rewritten and having readings, and a workshop at the California State University Summer Arts Festival. The reviewer of this production wrote: ""The play bears the mark of a youthful playwright. Howe's brilliant mind is teeming with enough ideas to fill several plays, and her themes and style at times suggest an early fascination with older playwrights such as Ionesco and Albee."" Birth and After Birth is ""a comedy... in which a self-centered, tantrum-throwing monster of a 4-year-old is played by a fully grown adult male.""Chasing Manet opened Off-Broadway at Primary Stages in April 2009, starring Jane Alexander and Lynn Cohen. The play takes place in a nursing home, with the ""rebellious painter"" and a Jewish woman becoming friends and planning on escaping to go to Paris aboard the QE2. Jane Alexander was a friend of Howe's from Sarah Lawrence College.Howe provided the text for the interdisciplinary work Cheri, conceived, directed and choreographed by Martha Clarke, which opened Off-Broadway in a Signature Theatre Company production at the Pershing Square Signature Center-Irene Diamond Stage on November 19, 2013, in previews.Her full-length play Singing Beach premiered Off-Broadway at HERE Arts Center on July 22, 2017, in previews in a limited engagement, produced by Theatre 167. Directed by Ari Laura Kreith, the cast featured Erin Beirnard, Devin Haqq, Jackson Demott Hill, John P. Keller, Tuck Milligan, Elodie Morss, and Naren Weiss. The play involves the effects that a Category 4 hurricane has on the Sleeper family and is concerned with climate change.Howe's plays have been produced in regional theatres in the United States, such as Louisville, Los Angeles, 
Stockbridge, Massachusetts, Annapolis, Maryland  and San Diego, as well as in London. Her plays have premiered in venues such as the Humana Festival at Actors Theatre of Louisville (Rembrandt's Gift, 2002) the Public Theater (The Art of Dining, 1979), and the Second Stage Theatre (One Shoe Off, 1983).

Native American use of fire in ecosystems,"Prior to the European colonization of the Americas, indigenous peoples used fire to modify the landscape. This influence over the fire regime was part of the environmental cycles and maintenance of wildlife habitats that sustained the cultures and economies of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas. What was initially perceived by colonists as ""untouched, pristine"" wilderness in North America was the cumulative result of the Indigenous use of fire, creating an mosaic of grasslands and forests across North America, sustained and managed by the peoples indigenous to the landscape.Radical disruption of Indigenous burning practices occurred with European colonization and the forced relocation of those who had historically maintained the landscape. Some colonists understood the traditional use and benefits of low-intensity broadcast burns (""Indian-type"" fires), but others feared and suppressed them. By the 1880s, the impacts of colonization had devastated indigenous populations, and fire exclusion had become more widespread. By the early 20th century, fire suppression had become the official US federal policy.Understanding pre-colonization land management and the traditional knowledge held by the Indigenous peoples who practice it provides an important basis for current re-engagement with the landscape and is critical for the correct interpretation of the ecological basis for vegetation distribution.


== Human-shaped landscape ==
Prior to the arrival of Europeans, Native Americans played a major role in determining the diversity of their ecosystems.
The most significant type of environmental change brought about by Precolumbian human activity was the modification of vegetation. [...] Vegetation was primarily altered by the clearing of forest and by intentional burning.  Natural fires certainly occurred but varied in frequency and strength in different habitats.  Anthropogenic fires, for which there is ample documentation, tended to be more frequent but weaker, with a different seasonality than natural fires, and thus had a different type of influence on vegetation.  The result of clearing and burning was, in many regions, the conversion of forest to grassland, savanna, scrub, open woodland, and forest with grassy openings. (William M. Denevan)
Fire was used to keep large areas of forest and mountains free of undergrowth for hunting or travel, or to create berry patches.Authors such as William Henry Hudson, Longfellow, Francis Parkman, and Thoreau contributed to the widespread myth that pre-Columbian North America was a pristine, natural wilderness, ""a world of barely perceptible human disturbance.” At the time of these writings, however, enormous tracts of land had already been allowed to succeed to climax due to the reduction in anthropogenic fires after the depopulation of Native peoples from epidemics of diseases introduced by Europeans in the 16th century, forced relocation, and warfare.


== Grasslands and savannas ==

When first encountered by Europeans, many ecosystems were the result of repeated fires every one to three years, resulting in the replacement of forests with grassland or savanna, or opening up the forest by removing undergrowth. Terra preta soils, created by slow burning, are found mainly in the Amazon basin, where estimates of the area covered range from 0.1 to 0.3%, or 6,300 to 18,900 km² of low forested Amazonia to 1.0% or more.There is some argument about the effect of human-caused burning when compared to lightning in western North America. Eyewitness accounts of extensive pre-settlement prairie in the 1600s, and the rapid conversion of extensive prairie areas to woodland on settlement, combined with accounts of the efforts made to make indigenous prairie burning practices illegal in Canada and the USA, all point to widespread pre-settlement control of fire with the intent to maintain and expand prairie areas. As Emily Russell (1983) has pointed out, “There is no strong evidence that Indians purposely burned large areas....The presence of Indians did, however, undoubtedly increase the frequency of fires above the low numbers caused by lightning.” As might be expected, Indian fire use had its greatest impact “in local areas near Indian
habitations.”


== Reasons for and benefits of burning ==
Reasons given for intentional burns in pre-contact ecosystems are numerous. They include:

Facilitating agriculture by rapidly recycling mineral-rich ash and biomass.
Increasing nut production in wild/wildcrafted orchards by darkening the soil layer with carbonized leaf litter, decreasing localized albedo, and increasing the average temperature in spring, when nut flowers and buds would be sensitive to late frosts.
Promoting the regrowth of fire-adapted food and utility plants by initiating seed germination or coppicing – shrub species like osier, willow, hazel, Rubus, and others have their lifespan extended and productivity increased through controlled cutting (burning) of branch stems.
Facilitating hunting by clearing underbrush and fallen limbs, allowing for more silent passage and stalking through the forest, as well as increasing visibility of game and clear avenues for projectiles.
Facilitating travel by reducing impassible brambles, underbrush and thickets.
Decreasing the risk of larger scale, catastrophic fires which consume decades of built-up fuel.
Increasing population of game animals by creating habitat in grasslands or increasing understory habitat of fire-adapted grass forage (in other words, wildcrafted pasturage) for deer, lagomorphs, bison, extinct grazing megafauna like mammoths, rhinoceros, camelids and others, the nearly extinct prairie chicken; and the populations of nut-consuming species like rodents, turkey and bear and notably the passenger pigeon through increased nut production (above); as well as the populations of their predators, i.e. mountain lions, lynx, bobcats, wolves, etc.
Increasing the frequency of regrowth of beneficial food and medicine plants, like clearing-adapted species like cherry, plum, and others.
Decreasing tick and biting insect populations by destroying overwintering instars and eggs.
Smoke density cools river temperatures and decreases evapotranspiration by plants, which increases river flow.
Rivers cooled by smoke density alert salmon that they may begin upstream migration.


== Impacts of European settlement ==

By the time that European explorers first arrived in North America, millions of acres of ""natural"" landscapes were already manipulated and maintained for human use. Fires indicated the presence of humans to many European explorers and settlers arriving on ship. In San Pedro Bay in 1542, chaparral fires provided that signal to Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, and later to others across all of what would be named California.In the American west, it is estimated that 456,500 acres (184,737 ha)  burned annually pre-settlement in what is now Oregon and Washington.By the 17th century, native populations were  greatly affected by the genocidal structure of settler colonialism. Many colonists often either deliberately set wildfires and/or allowed out of control fires to ""run free.""  Also, sheep and cattle owners, as well as shepherds and cowboys, often set the alpine meadows and prairies on fire at the end of the grazing season to burn the dried grasses, reduce brush, and kill young trees, as well as encourage the growth of new grasses for the following summer and fall grazing season. Native people were forced off their traditional landbases or killed, and traditional land management practices were eventually made illegal by settler governance.By the 19th century, many Indigenous nations had been forced to sign treaties with the federal government and relocate to reservations, which were sometimes hundreds of miles away from their ancestral homelands. In addition to violent and forced removal, fire suppression would become part of colonial methods of removal and genocide. As sociologist Kari Norgaard has shown, ""Fire suppression was mandated by the very first session of the California Legislature in 1850 during the apex of genocide in the northern part of the state."" For example, the Karuk peoples of Northern California ""burn [the forest] to enhance the quality of forest food species like elk, deer, acorns, mushrooms, and lilies, as well as basketry materials such as hazel and willow, but also keep travel routes open.” When such relationships to their environment were made illegal through fire suppression, it would have dramatic consequences on their methods of relating to one another, their environment, their food sources, and their educational practices. Thus, many scholars have argued that fire suppression can be seen as a form of ""Colonial Ecological Violence,"" ""which results in particular risks and harms experienced by Native peoples and communities.""Through the turn of the 20th century, settlers continued to use fire to clear the land of brush and trees in order to make new farm land for crops and new pastures for grazing animals – the North American variation of slash and burn technology – while others deliberately burned to reduce the threat of major fires – the so‑called ""light burning"" technique. Light burning is also been called ""Paiute forestry,"" a direct but derogatory reference to southwestern tribal burning habits. The ecological impacts of settler fires were vastly different than those of their Native American predecessors. Cultural burning practices were functionally made illegal with the passage of the Weeks Act in 1911.


== Altered fire regimes ==
Removal of indigenous populations and their controlled burning practices have resulted in major ecological changes, including increased severity of wild fires, especially in combination with Climate change. Attitudes towards Native American-type burning have shifted in recent times, and Tribal agencies and organizations, now with fewer restrictions placed on them, have resumed their traditional use of fire practices in a modern context by reintroducing fire to fire-adapted ecosystems, on and adjacent to, tribal lands. Many foresters and ecologists have also recognized the importance of Native fire practices. They are now learning from traditional fire practitioners and using controlled burns to reduce fuel accumulations, change species composition, and manage vegetation structure and density for healthier forests and rangelands.


== Archaeological Studies ==


=== Jemez Mountains ===
A study of the anthropological use of fire in the Jemez Mountain was conducted using charcoal samples in the soil and fire scars in tree rings. The study found that increases in low severity ecological fires were positively correlated with population changes, rather than climate changes. The study also found, from fungal evidence, that there were more herbivores present at times of increased burning and that the fires that occurred during the period of ancient settlement were less severe than modern wildfires in the region.


=== Stockbridge, MA ===
A study of sites in Massachusetts that were inhabited from 3000 BCE to 1000 CE found that the precedence of low severity landscape fires was correlated with periods of habitation by looking at charcoal sentiment samples. The research also found that periods of intense burning were correlated with increases in chestnut trees through looking at fossilized pollen samples. The study did not find any archaeological evidence that the fires were intentionally set, but a combination of historic accounts  from the region, the correlation with habitation, and the incentive for burning to increase nut producing trees, it is likely that these were anthropogenic fires.


=== Upper Cumberland Plateau of Tennessee ===
A study of charcoal and pollen deposits in Tennessee found regular anthropological fires were occurring from 3000 years ago to 200 years ago. However, the study found no evidence that the fires changed the overall vegetation that was present in the region.


=== Cliff Palace Pond, Kentucky ===
Research conducted by Paul Delcort in Kentucky pioneered the study of anthropogenic fires in the United States using archaeological techniques. These studies looked at pollen and charcoal sediment samples from sites in Kentucky to chart fires over time due to climate changes and human activity. The study found that between 1000 BCE and 1800 CE there was increased charcoal concentrations, suggesting frequent low severity fires. During this same period there was an increase in pollen from fire adapted tree species such as oak, chestnut, and hickory. There was also an increase in pollen from sunflowers and goose foot in forest areas which may suggest that there was food production in burned ecosystems. The studies found that fires which coincided with human habitation prior to fire suppression resulted in a diverse patchwork ecosystem with many plants that could be used by humans.


=== West Virginia ===
A Paleoarchealogical study of the Ohio River Valley in West Virginia found that ecosystems experienced coevolution with humans due to land management practices. The study concluded that these practices included burning and land clearing. They found that these practices altered soil carbon cycling and the diversity of plant species. They found that the use of fire decreased biomass,  increased charcoal abundance, and potentially led to more usable vegetation.

Manaia (mythological creature),"The Manaia is a mythological creature in Māori culture, and is a common motif in Māori carving and jewellery.
The Manaia is usually depicted as having the head of a bird and the tail of a fish and the body of a man, though it is sometimes depicted as a bird, a serpent, or a human figure in profile. Other interpretations include a seahorse and a lizard. The word manaia is cognate with the founding Samoan term fa'amanaia, and relevant to the Niuean fakamanaia, both meaning to make a decoration or embellishment.The Manaia is traditionally believed to be the messenger between the earthly world of mortals and the domain of the spirits, and its symbol is used as a guardian against evil. In this form, it is usually represented in a figure-of-eight shape, the upper half culminating in a bird-like beak. This form was also widely used in designs of door and window lintels and other architectural features, as well as in ceremonial hafts of weapons. A study of Māori carving suggests that every naturalistic figure there is an equivalent Manaia form which can be seen as a distorted profile-face version of the equivalent full-face figure. It may be that the Manaia represents some spiritual or inner facet of the full face figure.
Related Manaia-like symbols are also found in other Polynesian cultures, such as in Hawaii and Easter Island.
The manaia is a useful motif in carving, as it can be distorted to fit any shape and blended into many different designs. As such, it can be used to fill the empty spaces in wood carving, and in many compositions the background between the main figures is filled in with Manaia. It is a very common form in Maori jewellery (possibly only less common than the hei-tiki and hei matau), and is often found worn as a pendant carved from bone or greenstone. Manaia designs vary subtly in form between iwi, though they are often depicted as three-fingered, with these digits representing the trinity of birth, life, and death. A fourth finger, representing the circular rhythms of the life cycle and the afterlife, is also sometimes shown.

International Society for Applied Ethology,"The International Society for Applied Ethology is the leading non-profit professional organization for academics and scientists interested in the behaviour and welfare of confined or domesticated animals, including companion, farm, laboratory and zoo animal species.
The Society was created in Edinburgh in 1966, as the Society for Veterinary Ethology (SVE). It rapidly expanded to cover all applied aspects of Ethology and other Behavioural Sciences, which are relevant to many human-animal interactions, such as farming, wildlife management, the keeping of companion and laboratory animals, and the control of pests. The Society also quickly became increasingly international: it now has a federal, international structure as well as regional representatives around the world. In 1991, on the 25th anniversary of the SVE, the society was renamed the International Society for Applied Ethology (ISAE). At the International Congress that year a paper was presented by Carol Petherick and Ian Duncan entitled ""The Society for Veterinary Ethology 1966-1991 the 25th Anniversary Review"".Administration of the Society is the responsibility of a Council. The council also provides technical evidence on topics relating to animal behaviour and animal welfare during the committee stages of government legislation, for example, by discussion with groups such as the UK's Farm Animal Welfare Council. The European Parliament and the Council of Europe also consult council on such matters.
The membership is drawn from all areas of the world and is divided into 11 regions based on geography. ISAE encourages academic activity within the regions, including support of regional meetings, and also holds an annual Congress based, in alternate years, in Europe and elsewhere in the world. The 50th Anniversary Congress was held back in Edinburgh in July 2016 and commemorated with the publication of the book ""Animals and Us: 50 Years and More of Applied Ethology.""ISAE's official scientific journal is Applied Animal Behaviour Science (AABS), a monthly publication, originally established as Applied Animal Ethology in 1974. AABS continues to be published by Elsevier.
Honorary Fellows of the society include Ruth Harrison, Donald Broom and Michael C. Appleby. Another notable member is Temple Grandin.

V-Cube 7,"The V-Cube 7 is a combination puzzle in the form of a 7×7×7 cube. The first mass-produced 7×7×7 was invented by Panagiotis Verdes and is produced by the Greek company Verdes Innovations SA. Other such puzzles have since been introduced by a number of Chinese companies, some of which have mechanisms which improve on the original. Like the 5×5×5, the V-Cube 7 has both fixed and movable center facets.


== Mechanics ==
The puzzle consists of 218 unique miniature cubes (""cubies"") on the surface. Six of these (the central tiles of the six faces) are attached directly to the internal ""spider"" frame and are fixed in position relative to one another. The V-Cube 6 uses essentially the same mechanism, except that on the latter the central rows, which hold the rest of the pieces together, are completely hidden.There are 150 center pieces which show one color each, 60 edge pieces which show two colors each, and eight corner pieces which show three colors each. Each piece (or quintet of edge pieces) shows a unique color combination, but not all combinations are present (for example, there is no piece with both red and orange sides, since red and orange are on opposite sides of the solved Cube). The location of these cubes relative to one another can be altered by twisting the outer layers of the Cube 90°, 180° or 270°, but the location of the colored sides relative to one another in the completed state of the puzzle cannot be altered: it is fixed by the relative positions of the fixed center squares and the distribution of color combinations on edge and corner pieces.
Currently, the V-Cube 7 is produced with white plastic as a base, with red opposite orange, blue opposite green, and yellow opposite black. Verdes and other manufacturers also sell cubes with black plastic and a white face, with the other colors remaining the same, and solid plastic versions with the plastic the colour itself and no stickers. The fixed black or white center piece is branded with the logo of the manufacturer, which is V on cubes by Verdes. Flag variations of 7×7s including Germany, Poland and Russia, are also sold by Verdes.
Unlike the flat-sided V-Cube 6, the V-Cube 7 is noticeably rounded. This departure from a true cube shape is necessary, since the mechanism used on this puzzle would not function properly with layers of identical thickness. Other means (such as magnets) would be required. Note from the image at right that if a 7×7×7 were to be constructed with layers of identical thickness the corner pieces (shown in red) would lose contact with the rest of the puzzle when a side was rotated 45 degrees. The V-Cube 6 and V-Cube 7 both solve the problem by using thicker outer layers. The rounded shape of the V-Cube 7 results in corner stickers that are similar in size to the center stickers, which helps hide the unequal thickness.
Cubes from other manufacturers can be found with rounded or flat sides, but all use thicker outer layers.


=== Permutations ===
There are 8 corner ""cubies"", 60 edges and 150 centers (6 fixed, 144 movable).
Any permutation of the corners is possible, including odd permutations. Seven of the corners can be independently rotated, and the orientation of the eighth depends on the other seven, giving 8!×37 combinations. 
There are 144 movable centers, consisting of six sets of 24 pieces each. Within each set there are four centers of each color. Centers from one set cannot be exchanged with those from another set. Each set can be arranged in 24! different ways. Assuming that the four centers of each color in each set are indistinguishable, the number of permutations of each set is reduced to 24!/(246) arrangements, all of which are possible. The reducing factor comes about because there are 24 (4!) ways to arrange the four pieces of a given color. This is raised to the sixth power because there are six colors. The total number of permutations of all movable centers is the permutations of a single set raised to the sixth power, 24!6/(2436). 
There are 60 edge pieces, consisting of 12 central, 24 intermediate, and 24 outer edges. The central edges can be flipped but the rest cannot, due to the internal shape of the pieces, nor can an edge from one set exchange places with one from another set. The five edges in each matching quintet are distinguishable, since corresponding non-central edges are mirror images of each other. There are 12!/2 ways to arrange the central edges, since an odd permutation of the corners implies an odd permutation of these pieces as well. There are 211 ways that they can be flipped, since the orientation of the twelfth edge depends on the preceding eleven. Any permutation of the intermediate and outer edges is possible, including odd permutations, giving 24! arrangements for each set or 24!2 total, regardless of the position or orientation of any other pieces.
This gives a total number of permutations of

This center piece can be oriented in four different ways, which increases the number of patterns by a factor of four to 7.80×10160. Any orientation of the fixed center piece is usually regarded as solved.


== Solution ==
The most common  strategy involves grouping similar edge pieces into solid strips, and centers into one-colored blocks.  This allows the cube to be quickly solved with the same methods one would use for a 3×3×3 cube. Because the permutations of the corners, central edges and fixed centers have the same parity restrictions as the 3×3×3 cube, once reduction is complete the parity errors seen on the 4×4×4 and 6×6×6 cannot occur on the 7×7×7. However, it is still possible to get a parity where certain edges in the last edge that is grouped are flipped, and to solve this a slightly modified parity algorithm is used to rotate them.Another strategy is to solve the edges of the cube first. The corners can be placed just as they are in any previous order of cube puzzle, and the centers are manipulated with an algorithm similar to the one used in the 4×4×4 cube. However, this method is very rarely used and is often less move-efficient.

Mișu Benvenisti,"Mișu Benvenisti, also known as Mishu or Moshe Benvenisti (Hebrew: מישו בנבנישתי; July 1, 1902 – 1977), was a Romanian lawyer, Zionist militant, and leader of the Romanian Jewish community. Born into a family of printers and publishers, he was one of the few Sephardi Jews to reach prominence in political life during the Romanian Kingdom era. His association with Zionism began in his teenage years, and saw him emerging as leader of the Zionist Youth Organization (part of the HeHalutz, HH) in the early 1920s. Benvenisti was then primarily affiliated with the Renașterea Noastră group in Bucharest, joining the small Jewish National Party by 1930; through these, he participated in the formation of a nation-wide Jewish Party (PER), wherein he was youth organizer and general secretary. After 1936, he was also a member of the Romanian office of the World Jewish Congress (WJC), serving as its lawyer and as a rapporteur on the growth of local antisemitism.
During the late 1930s, Romania drew closer to Nazi Germany and gradually introduced discrimination against Jews; the National Renaissance Front banned the PER, along with all other Romanian political parties, in early 1938. Zionists were allowed to form non-political bodies, which encouraged a wave of emigrations into Mandatory Palestine. As Nazi pressures increased with the arrival in power of Ion Antonescu, Benvenisti considered emigrating, but accepted appointment as chairman of the Zionist Executive. His political line there was one of moderation: he expressed loyalty toward Romania and increased control over the rebellious HH, intervening as a negotiator between the regime and the Jewish community. His stance was criticized by Jews on the right, including A. L. Zissu, as a form of collaborationism, especially due to his contacts with the submissive Central Jewish Office. 
Faced with the Holocaust occurring on Romania's borders, Benvenisti also cultivated the Jewish resistance—in particular by helping Hungarian, Slovak and Polish Jews find temporary shelter in Romania, or by assisting survivors of Antonescu's own deportations to Transnistria. Benvenisti and other Jewish leaders persuaded the Antonescu government to relax pressures on the Jews, though the Executive also had to agree to collect large sums as contributions and bribes. The Romanian Zionists' role in sabotaging the Holocaust was documented by the local Judenberater, Gustav Richter. As a result of his investigations, Romanian authorities reluctantly arrested Benvenisti in January 1944. He was released in March, by which time he had lost the confidence of his peers, being replaced at the head of the Executive by his rival Zissu. For the rest of 1944, Benvenisti presided upon his own splinter party, the Zionist Democratic Group Klal.
Antonescu's downfall in August 1944 revived Romania's multi-party regime; consequently, Zissu and Benvenisti returned as factional leaders of the PER, with the former holding the party chairmanship. Benvenisti was moving toward the Jewish left, and embracing cooperation with the Romanian Communist Party and the Jewish Democratic Committee (CDE). In mid 1946, he replaced the anti-communist Zissu as president of both the WJC chapter and the PER, drawing the latter into an alliance with the CDE before the November elections. With the communists' turn to anti-Zionism, Benvenisti shut down the PER, criticized illegal emigration, and took political advice from CDE cadres such as Bercu Feldman. When the Romanian communist regime took over on the last days of 1947, he ended his Zionist involvement, though he and his wife Suzana still applied for emigration into Israel. Benvenisti was arrested in 1950 by the Securitate, tortured into confessing that he was a spy for Israel, and appeared at a show trial, alongside Zissu, in 1954. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, but ultimately freed and allowed to settle in Israel, which became his home for the final two decades of his life.


== Biography ==


=== Early life and career ===
The Benvenistis belonged to the Sephardi minority (Romanian: evrei sefarzi or evrei spanioli) within the larger Jewish community. They were first noted locally for their contribution in publishing: in 1876, two of its members, Sandu and David, created Frații Benvenisti—a major Jewish printing press, centered on Craiova city. Memoirist Mariu Theodorian-Carada recalled in 1938 that ""Benvenisti the elder was the only Craiova Jew to wear a fur-lined caftan"". Mișu was born to Simon Benvenisti and Ernestina Schlanger on July 1, 1902. His maternal grandfather, Adolf Schlanger, was Romania's oldest traveling salesman at the time of his death in December 1906. Mișu's father, who lived between 1870 and 1943, had worked for Frații Benvenisti library and then for Editura Alcalay company, until establishing his own editorial imprint, Editura Ancora. He was highly respected in the Romanian literary community, and noted especially for his role in promoting figures such as Eugen Lovinescu, George Bacovia, and Liviu Rebreanu. In 1922, Simon was sponsoring an annual Benvenisti Prize, awarded by the Romanian Writers' Society to debuting poets. His elder son Felix preserved the family tradition as director of Bicurim publishers; born in Bucharest in 1900, Felix was working as a clerk during the 1950s. Maternal cousins of Felix and Mișu included Dolfi Urseanu, who worked at the State Opera Theater.As the second son, Mișu was primarily interested in the legal profession and politics. In 1918 or 1919, soon after hearing about the Balfour Declaration, and influenced by his colleague Carol Singer, he joined a Zionist youth group called Hatalmid. He served as its president in 1919–1920, during which time he was acquainted with more senior Zionist figures, including activist Leon Mizrachi, Mișu Weissman, and Chief Rabbi Jacob Itzhak Niemirower. In 1920, while studying law at the University of Bucharest, he was recruited by the Jewish students' organization, Hașmonea, and, on Mizrachi's proposal, was elected chairman of the Zionist Youth Organization of Romania (1923–1924). This period saw him involved in at least one scuffle with antisemitic colleagues: on January 31, 1923, they tried to prevent Benvenisti and Samuel Steinberg from hearing a lecture by Mircea Djuvara; ""other Jewish students arrived in"" to assist, after which the two groups fought each other, leaving three Jews and one Romanian slightly injured. His brother, meanwhile, had embraced anti-Zionism, joining the Association of Romanian Jews in Brăila, which declared itself in favor of complete Jewish assimilation.In 1925, Mișu Benvenisti joined Cornel Iancu's new Zionist lodge, Renașterea Noastră (""Our Rebirth""), where he remained an active member until the early months of 1944. A hostile A. L. Zissu recalled in 1951: ""All that I now when it comes to Benvenisti's political activity in the interwar is that he was a very active member of the Zionist group Renașterea, and very ambitious about rapidly acquiring offices, ahead of those who were older and more committed, that he was extremely conceited about his own political genius, going as far as to imagine himself a predestined leader."" Benvenisti graduated in 1924. After completing a one-year mandatory term in the Romanian Land Forces (at Timișoara), he registered with the bar association in Ilfov County. In early 1928, he was providing legal services for Renașterea Noastră, with Moți (Motti) Moscovici as his secretary. Moscovici also recounts that, in 1928–1929, Benvenisti also went on a study trip to Paris, where he intended to become a Doctor of Law: ""He was absent for about a year, but never graduated."" In July 1929, he and I. Schechter were among the 15 delegates of the Romanian Jewry to the Sixteenth Zionist Congress in Zürich. They were also the only two Romanians to have been elected by ""radical"" Zionist lodges, against a ""centrist"" mainstream.By August 1929, Benvenisti had returned to Bucharest. The Jewish members of Parliament, who had since established an ethnic club, elected him to represent them at a Tomis Hall meeting protesting the anti-Jewish incidents in Mandatory Palestine; by 1930, he was officially the Jewish club secretary. In November, he challenged a clerk, Ștefan Iacobescu, to duel him on Luterană Street (Iacobescu never showed up). Benvenisti's major client as a lawyer was the firm Frații Buhler, a Swiss–Romanian importer of grinding machines. This job initially provided him with ""modest revenue"" that, from about 1932, he was forced to share with his gravely ill father. Around 1932, he met and fell in love with the seven-years-younger bank clerk Suzana Mărculescu, but could not live with her full-time, as both had to attend to their ailing parents. According to his recollections, she did not share his Zionist ideals, and maintained ""irony and regret for the time and energy I spent on matters such as politics"". They were only wed under Jewish law in May 1944—making Benvenisti cousins by marriage with composer Ricu Mălineanu and with singer Mara Ianoli-Mălineanu.
By March 1930, Benvenisti and Sami Stern had joined a Bucharest-based Jewish National Party, inspired by the views of Adolphe Stern. In speeches he made at the time, he noted that the group's existence was not directed ""against the Romanian parties, but against all organizations which trample upon the Jewish population's needs."" In August, shortly after the Sighet Jewish Temple had been set ablaze, the ""General Council of Romanian Jews"" delegated him to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, where he demanded details on the investigation. The same month, with local elections held in Bucharest, he submitted his candidacy on the ""Jewish group"" list for Bucharest Sector II (Black), second on that list after Sami Stern.Benvenisti subsequently affiliated with Tivadar Fischer's nationwide Jewish Party (PER). In the parliamentary election of June 1931, he unsuccessfully contested two seats in the Assembly of Deputies—holding the last place on the PER's Ilfov list, and the first place in Tutova County. He was voted in as leader of the Sector II chapter on September 8, 1932. Benvenisti set up the PER youth branch (Tineretul Partidului Evreiesc) in 1934; the same year, he was also appointed the general secretary of the party at large. He was seconded at the youth section by Sami Iakerkaner, and had Jean Cohen among his subordinates. Moscovici nominates him as the PER's major electoral agent and propagandist. Historian Valeriu-Alexandru Moraru notes that Benvenisti and Cohen were the only two Sephardi men to be active in the PER; according to Moraru, the two, alongside M. Leon of the rival Union of Romanian Jews (UER), were also the only three Sephardim active in Romanian Jewish politics at any level.


=== Fighting antisemitism ===
Benvenisti was reportedly a perennial candidate for parliamentary seats throughout the interwar. During the general elections of December 1933, he ran in two Bessarabian constituencies—Bălți and Orhei. The lists, respectively headlined by Rahmil Ioffe and Michel Landau, only took small percentages of the vote—6% in Bălți, and 1% in Orhei. He also ran second after Mayer Ebner in Suceava County, sharing in the 3.7% result; and third, after Tivadar Fischer and Alexandru Nobel, on the list for Rădăuți County, which took 3.8%. As part of his efforts, Benvenisti also went on national conference tours, and, while in Turnu Severin, met a future Zionist doctrinaire, Theodor Loewenstein-Lavi. Those years brought him into contact with the World Zionist Organization (WZO), allowing him to greet Nahum Goldmann and Nahum Sokolow on their respective visits to Romania. Benvenisti notes that the WZO's Romanian delegate Sami Singer, who was following the Nazi takeover in Weimar Germany, asked him to become a rapporteur on Romania's own ""antisemitic currents"". On May 7, 1935, he spoke at the Sephardi Community House in Bucharest about the plight of Jews under the Nazi regime.On January 29, 1936, Benvenisti was one of five party representatives who signed into existence the PER–UER alliance. Called Central Council of Romanian Jews, it existed for the ""defence of all rights and liberties of a general character of the Jews who are Roumanian citizens or subjects, within the framework of the Constitution and of the Laws of the Country."" In May of that year, Renașterea Noastră's eponymous newspaper carried an article by Benvenisti which made him an official enemy of Germany, for celebrating the boycott of Nazi business and for condemning German rearmament. In late 1936 or early 1937, both Cohen and Benvenisti were recruited by the Romanian Committee of World Jewish Congress (WJC), serving under Sami Singer and Sami Stern. His was a salaried position, and included acting as WJC corporate lawyer.Benvenisti was elected the PER's vice president in 1936. During the parliamentary election of December 1937, the PER ran as an informal ally of the National Peasants' Party (PNȚ), despite the latter having a non-aggression pact with the fascist Iron Guard. The arrangements were made by Tivadar Fischer but approved by other PER men. They included Benvenisti, who later reflected on his contribution as having been a ""great mistake."" He and Francisc Jambor headlined the PER list for the Assembly in Roman County, which only took 2% of the vote; Benvenisti also had an eligible second position in Hotin County (3% of the vote) and Soroca County (4%), as well as the third position in Storojineț (5%).The advent of antisemitism after the election marginalized both assimilated and Zionist Jews. On March 30, 1938, a dictatorial regime formed around King Carol II banned the PER, later setting up its single official party, or National Renaissance Front (FRN). Carol still allowed Jews to organize for emigration into Palestine (Aliyah Bet). In 1939, shortly before the start of World War II, Benvenisti was again called under arms, serving to 1940 as a Sublieutenant and regimental paymaster. As part of its expansion of antisemitic laws, the government debarred Benvenisti. A review board under Coty Stoicescu found that his claim for a legal exemption was groundless, upholding his debarment in early September 1940; this remained his status until reinstatement in 1944. The emigration effort was organized through a Zionist Executive, which survived the FRN's downfall. During late September 1940, Romania emerged as an ally of the Axis countries; Ion Antonescu took over government, as Romania's Conducător, and, initially, as a senior partner of the Iron Guard. The latter was expelled from government in January 1941, following a Guardist revolt and anti-Jewish pogrom. According to Moscovici, Benvenisti was in Bucharest shortly after these events, frantically preparing his own escape to Palestine, and upset by the lengthy approval process. In March or April, Benvenisti was made leader of the Zionist Executive—which coordinated Renașterea Noastră and other organizations. He took over from Mizrachi, who had actually managed to obtain a Palestine visa.This assignment put Benvenisti in direct contact with the Istanbul branch of the Jewish Agency for Israel and its representatives Mayer Segall and Haim Barlas, who successively handled the emigration project in Romania. On May 17, the Executive received its legal recognition from the Siguranța police, allowing it to be formally joined in May by factions such as Tnuat HaMizrahi and Ihud. Allegedly, Romanian recognition was granted only after General Emanoil Leoveanu, as head of the Siguranța, had Litman appointed as Moscovici's second-in-command; the allegation is that Litman was trusted by Leoveanu's clique. According to Zissu, Benvenisti's claim to chairmanship was still questionable: Mizrachi had allegedly delegated his duties by phone. This is contracted by a Siguranța reports, which notes that Mizrachi, ""disgusted"" by Romanian politics, announced his departure and delegation of powers with an ""impressive session"" of the Zionist movement. According to Cohen, Mizrachi had recommended his friend as ""the most capable of solving what was then a most delicate problem, namely disciplining youth and coordinating its activities.""June 1941 witnessed the onset of Operation Barbarossa, which saw Romania waging war on the Soviet Union as a German ally. According to Cohen, many in the Executive, including Benvenisti, Iancu and himself, as well as M. H. Maxy, Moscovici, Tully Rosenthal and Iosif Ebercohn, supported Romania's war effort. Renașterea Noastră published an article by Leon B. Wexler which celebrated the recovery of Bessarabia as a victory for Romanian nationalism. Despite such displays of loyalism, pressures on Jews were again increased—a Transnistria Governorate, established in former Soviet territory, became a target of deportation and selective killing for Bessarabian Jews, as well as for some groups of Jews in Romania-proper. Benvenisti and fellow Zionist Executive man Cornel Iancu joined the Assistance Committee presided upon by Arnold Schwefelberg, which offered some relief to survivors of Transnistrian marches. He also organized relief for survivors of the Iași pogrom who were stranded at Călărași—alongside fellow Zionists Abraham Feller, Iacov Litman, and Lazăr Wurmbrand, he oversaw a fundraiser for this group.Benvenisti once explained the Executive as having limited power over adherents: ""The independence of groups, be they adult or junior, was strict and absolute, without there being any possibility of intrusion by any of the Executive leaders."" He spoke of his main activities at the Executive as including ""the preparation of youth for emigration, as well as cultural activity"". In line with promises made to Mizrachi, he stepped in to discipline the Zionist youth, or HeHalutz (HH), and, Moscovici notes, was the first-ever Zionist leader to manage this task. Soon after taking over, he had discovered a postcard which showed that the group had convened a national conference ""without telling him about it and without the necessary authorization."" Benvenisti was infuriated, particularly since this could make him a suspect in Siguranța's eyes. He reformed the HH into a single structure, and set up the first Hebrew-language school, Tarbuth. Poldi Filderman was tasked with overseeing its day-to-day administration, while Iancu and Loewenstein-Lavi directed the education efforts.


=== Against Richter ===
In January 1942, Antonescu's government formed a state-controlled Central Jewish Office, which nominally supplanted the Zionist Executive; its direct overseer was a non-Jewish Commissioner, Radu Lecca. Bevenisti was immediately inducted as its regional leader in Ilfov. He resigned on the spot, but accepted a parallel appointment to the Office's Transnistrian relief committee on Calea Moșilor (until being sacked later in 1942). He and his colleagues rejected the implicit outlawing of their Zionist organization, and sought remedial action. As he recounts, Romanian authorities were sympathetic to such demands, but noted that the matter was of direct interest to the Nazi agency in Romania; consequently, Benvenisti and Iancu visited with the local Judenberater, Gustav Richter. Richter reportedly informed his guests that Germany was allied with the Palestinian Arabs, and that Jews could only hope for another ""area of land outside Europe"", allocated to them by Adolf Hitler. In the meantime, they were to ""consider Zionist activity in Romania as finished"". Benvenisti and Iancu pleaded with Lecca, informing him that a ban would push Zionism into active resistance against Antonescu. Lecca reviewed their arguments and decided to override Richter, renewing the organizational permits. Together with Chief Rabbi Alexandru Șafran and Zalman Rabinsohn, he also persuaded Romanian authorities to allow Sabbath worship in Jewish schools.Benvenisti's policy drew immediate criticism in the Jewish community. When, in May 1942, he asked that all Zionist groups adhere to his political line, those left in the minority complained about his ""autocratic attitude"". Cohen was among the dissenters, angered that Benvenisti had scaled down emigration and was working on it only with a highly corrupt Greek freighter, Yannos Pandelis. Zissu maintained that Benvenisti was guilty of ""collaboration"", especially by allowing Loewenstein-Lavi to serve on the board of the Central Jewish Office. He resented Benvenisti for cultivating former UER head Wilhelm Filderman, despite Filderman being a Jewish assimilationist: ""[his] politics were categorically opposed to the national policy"". This notion was rejected by Benvenisti, who argued that, at any point during the war, Filderman spoke in favor of ""mass emigration"". In various contexts, Benvenisti was also adamant that he never allowed his Zionist group to be either collaborative or usable by the Antonescu regime. Lavi's role, he claimed, was in ""sabotaging"" Richter's attempts at complete racial segregation (an interpretation which was supported by Moscovici). He admitted to having assisted his own brother in securing unpaid employment at the Central Jewish Office, which helped Felix with fulfilling the requirements to be spared from his forced labor duties.While reviewing his own activities, Benvenisti described at some length his contribution to rescuing Hungarian, Slovak, and Polish Jews escaping the Holocaust in Europe. He notes that he participated in covering up the details of these operations: though officially presented as ""500 families"" largely comprising children, the refugees were in fact mostly young men and women. In order to accomplish this task, he contacted General Leoveanu, who permitted that the refugees sail out of Constanța Harbor. Benvenisti made a point of preserving links with Jewish groups in southern Transylvania (the region's northern half having been ceded to Hungary). He visited these constituencies on two occasions, in mid 1942 and mid 1943, and claimed to have blocked Romanian authorities from staging a ""judicial farce"" that would have resulted in the prosecution of Transylvanian Zionists. Moscovici, who renders an account by Itzhak Herzig ""Artzi"", suggests that Benvenisti's on Popa Petre Street 42 (in Bucharest's Armenian Quarter) was always ""packed full with Zionist eminences and youth leaders"", who presented Benvenisti with topical reports.According to his own reports, Benvenisti once overheard Lecca's conversations, becoming the first person to record his approval for the mass deportation of 40,000 Transylvanian and Banatian Jews to Nazi extermination camps; he also notes his and Carol Reiter's role in stopping ""this new monstrosity"", by appealing to Antonescu himself. Similarly, Benvenisti and Wilhelm Filderman also persuaded Lecca not to detain Polish Jews who were transiting Romania: ""[we showed that] our country's prestige was going to be even more tarnished, given the interest of foreign countries in the plight of these Polish citizens."" He recounts his contribution to a concentrated effort by the ""informal Jewish leaders"", whereby they prevented the authorities of Cernăuți from expelling Jewish refugees back into the General Government. Such activities were angrily reviewed by Richter. On August 8, 1942, Bukarester Tagblatt published Richter's piece exposing Zionist activities, which also alleged that Benvenisti was an English spy. The Zionist Executive had been formally outlawed on August 7 by Romanian authorities answering to Richter's requests, but continued to meet in conspiratorial secrecy.In autumn 1942, Lecca and the Central Jewish Office informed Zionist leaders that they were expected to cover Romania's wartime expenses with a major loan. According to Benvenisti, he tried to oppose the measure, noting that ""its realization would be impossible"". He also claimed to have been threatened with deportation to Transnistria for either himself or the Jews as a whole; researchers Teodor Wexler and Mihaela Popov view this version of events as truthful. At the time, Wilhelm Filderman was singled out as a ""saboteur"" of the war effort by Lecca, for having sought to block the loan. Benvenisti and Rabbi Șafran stood by Filderman, and, as Benvenisti notes, expected to persuade Antonescu himself to rescind the order. Instead, their opposition resulted in Filderman's deportation to a Transnistrian camp, at Moghilău. Benvenisti's name was found on a document which agreed to furnish the loan—however, he claimed to have no recollection of signing it. Moscovici alleged that Benvenisti personally handled collection, and that he coerced the ""masses of Jewish laborers"" into contributing. Himself a ""loan inspector"" in that context, Cohen attests that Benvenisti gave directives to postpone payments as much as possible. In April 1943, the Executive leader was included on a list of Jewish hostages who had to account for their whereabouts with the authorities—in his case, those of Bucharest's 2nd Police Precinct, who recorded his residence as still being on Popa Petre.


=== HeHalutz trial and marginalization ===
The Zionist Executive dissolved itself in summer 1943—according to Zissu, this was a public embarrassment, resulting from corrupt deals made by Shlomo Entzer at the Palestine Office, under Benvenisti's watch. Benvenisti contrarily reports that he was always critical of Entzer's focus on prioritizing ""rich children"" for places on outbound ships. In mid 1943, after an intercession by Romanian doctor Bazil Teodorescu, Benvenisti and Filderman obtained an audience with Deputy Premier Mihai Antonescu. Upon meeting him, they asked for urgent humanitarian measures to redress the Romanian Jews' precarious situation. Their host promised to curb the Transnistrian experiment, and to repatriate its survivors; he also expressed approval for mass emigration into Palestine, and guaranteed that he would contact the governments of Germany and Bulgaria ""so that no obstacles would be posed to an emigration that the Romanian government also supported.""Over the next months, Benvenisti prepared 75 children for ""overland emigration"" by rail. His effort was curbed by the Bulgarian authorities, who cancelled the group's transit visas. With Filderman and Carol Iancu, he also approached the smuggler Arthur Tester, who informed that that he was the only one capable of bypassing Bulgarian opposition. Tester asked that they pay him 2,500 lei per child rescued. Benvenisti and Filderman also kept contacts with the semi-legal opposition, represented in the main by the PNȚ. They met with PNȚ leaders Iuliu Maniu and Ghiță Popp, who promised to assist them with preventing the deportation of Bukovina Jews, as well as with asking Antonescu's men to improve the living conditions of those already held in Vapniarka and Grosulovo. Accompanied by Iancu's wife Mella, he also visited Dinu Brătianu of the National Liberal Party. Though noting that he could not hope to persuade the Conducător to improve on his antisemitic record, Brătianu put Benvenisti in contact with his party colleague Ion Costinescu, who was presiding over the Romanian Red Cross and who ""undertook the most energetic efforts toward [the deportees'] repatriation.""Benvenisti believes that, throughout 1943, Richter had remained on his trail. In mid 1942, the chairman of the Central Jewish Office (namely, Henric Streitman) ""though it best to warn me that it would be best for me to leave for Palestine, to save myself, while assuring me that I would get my permit to leave from the Romanian government."" As noted by historian Dennis Deletant, his name surface during an investigation of Zionist escape routes by the German Foreign Ministry, which ""passed this information on to the Romanian authorities as evidence of 'hostile' activities""; Siguranța and Gestapo agents chanced upon letters and receipts which implicated Benvenisti in illegal acts, resulting in his arrest on January 30, 1944. Together with Fischer and Jacques Rosenzweig, he appeared before the Bucharest Tribunal, specifically charged with aiding and abetting Polish Jews in Cernăuți. He was held at the Police Prefecture, where, he claims, the Gestapo became directly involved in securing his indictment. Likewise, ""Lecca and Richter [...] came by once a day [...], asking for new arrests to be made and compiling grounds for accusations against us.""Benvenisti was ultimately released in early March 1944, after Wilhelm Filderman and the Swiss ambassador, René de Weck, had vouched for him. Mella Iancu recounts that she was also involved in bribing Siguranța Commissioner Albert Rădulescu with hundreds of thousands of lei from Zionist Executive coffers, which, she claims, contributed to his leniency on that specific matter. In his official notes, Rădulescu asserted that neither Benvenisti nor his Zionist colleagues posed any danger for Romania's internal order. Benvenisti himself credited his success to his defense team, which comprised Doru Gherson and S. Hart, to Filderman and Zissu, as well as to ""the most progressive left-wing circles""—the trial, he maintained, was one of ""racial persecution"". This account is partly contradicted by Moscovici, who argues that Zissu was entirely opposed to bailing out his adversary. Officially, he and all the other defendants received six-month sentences, but their time in confinement was reduced. Bevenisti complained that his ""five-weeks detention"" was ""succeeded by month upon month of me being tormented with harassment and threats"".Zissu reports that, in the resulting panic following the arrests, Renașterea wanted Benvenisti stripped of any decision-making powers, for which reason Zissu himself was made president of a new, but unrecognized, Zionist Executive. This is partly contradicted by Benvenisti's account, which notes that he willingly resigned ""by the end of 1943, or by the start of 1944"", or ""not long after my liberation"". He took this decision when a group of Romanian and Palestinian Zionists (including Zissu, Entzer, Barlas and Moritz Geiger) expressed their wish to defy the British caps on immigration by fitting illegal transports of Jews. From the moment of his release to April 1946, Benvenisti was largely absent from the Zionist Executive—though he accepted invitations to attend meetings chaired by Zissu, and spoke there on several occasions. He was instead elected chairman of a more centrist political party, the Zionist Democratic Group Klal, which had also rejected Zissu's policies.The period also saw a round-up of the HH by Romanian authorities. As reported by Benvenisti, the Zionist youth had drawn attention to itself in 1942, when members of the Hashomer Hatzair were allegedly caught circulating lei banknotes marked Jos războiul! (""Down with war!"") or Afară cu nemții! (""Out with the Kraut!""). They were indicted for ""communist activities""; in similar vein, Gordonia youths were prosecuted for assisting in the emigration effort. Before being himself arrested, Benvenisti had been approached by Gherș Tabacinic-Sunea and two other young Zionists, who had allegedly asked him to bribe Romanian policemen handling the case. He also appeared as a defense witness in both trials, which took place in April–May 1944. He argued there that all communist propaganda found with the HH was purely for informative purposes, and that Gordonia had official approval for its actions. The Tribunal asked for him to repeat his plea, which ""was unheard of"" in judicial annals. This apparent show of clemency was overturned by the final verdict, which passed harsh sentences on all defendants, including the 12-years-old Bianca Calmy; three HH boys were sentenced to death and subsequently executed. All survivors were pardoned in early 1944 by King Michael I.
Together with Wilhelm Fischer, Benvenisti continued to organize the relief effort for Jewish deportees in Transnistria: ""I was the one providing exact instructions for the HeHalutz personnel who went on illegal trips into Transnistria to provide aid and to attempt the rescue of people wherever this was feasible."" However, ""once my persecution by Richter became more acute, I was removed from the assistance commission, on his express order. [...] Thanks to the continuous interventions I made with the Central [Jewish Office], Zionist representatives were finally accepted on the commissions that had left for Transnistria, which were presided upon by Mr Fred Șaraga."" By February 1944, Benvenisti, Moscovici and Iancu Scarlat were facing prosecution for an alleged participation in forging papers that exempted Isac Juman and other Jews from their labor duties.Both Zissu and Cohen argue that, in May or June 1944, Benvenisti unwittingly jeopardized a major rescue plan for the Hungarian Jews, when he showed up for direct talks with Lecca and Antonescu, without consulting them and other Jewish leaders. These asked for an ""honor jury"" of the Zionist Executive to rule on Filderman and Benvenisti's conduct—its members were Șafran, Poldi Filderman, and Leon Ghelerter. He agreed to appear, and testified that he was only present in Antonescu's office to validate Zissu as the person of contact; Zissu himself continued to allege that this was a lie. At the time, however, Zissu also approached Benvenisti during talks to reestablish the PER as an illegal resistance group—negotiations toward this end were held in the Iancus' home.


=== Communist turn ===
Throughout the first half of 1944, with Soviet troops on Romania's border, it became apparent that Germany could no longer vouch for Romania's survival as an independent country. After his marriage in May, Benvenisti was preparing to join the Hungarian Jewish exodus by embarking with his family on one of the ships for which Zissu had obtained permission to leave Romania. He informed Mihai Antonescu of this during a second meeting in Teodorescu's home, prompting the latter to ask a favor of him: upon  arrival, he was to inform the Western Allies that Romania would surrender, if Britain and the United States agreed to partake in its occupation. The Deputy Premier regarded Soviet occupation as the guarantee of an ""exclusively communist regime"". Antonescu also wanted the Yishuv to know that the regime had been comparatively lenient toward Jews, and that communism would be detrimental to both communities. Benvenisti gave up on his emigration plan when his mother was diagnosed with a heart condition which made it unlikely that she could survive the journey; he also noted that Suzana was depressed by the thought of leaving Romania.Benvenisti claims that, on August 22, 1944, government officials rushed him to the Sturdza Palace on Calea Victoriei, asking him to urgently send a message to the ""world's Jewish organizations"", and, through them, the Churchill war ministry, announcing that Romania was ready to surrender. He reports that he declined, prompting one bureaucrat to comment: ""That Mr [Wilhelm] Filderman is more of a patriot than you are."" These alleged events were closely followed by the coup of August 23, which deposed the Antonescus and denounced the Axis alliance. From that moment on, Zionists were again allowed to organize in the open. Benvenisti returned to public life with an essay detailing his contribution to Jewish life and Zionist politics during the previous three years. It was published over three issues of Viața Evreească weekly, and then as a booklet. Viața Evreească was a joint venture between Benvenisti and Mendel H. Bady, but did not survive for long.Like Cohen, Wilhelm Filderman and Zissu, Benvenisti was reassigned a seat on the WJC Romanian Committee. It elected him a local vice president, alongside Schwefelberg, Eduard Manolescu, and Bernard Rohrlich. The PER was soon reestablished; he and Wilhelm Fischer were co-opted by Zissu to serve as its vice presidents. Benvenisti formed a Mixed Judicial Commission, which represented Zionist and non-Zionist parties and organizations, in a common effort to undo the antisemitic legacy and obtain increased rights for Jews. Together with Wilhelm Fischer and Schwefelberg, he presented WJC demands to Gheorghe Vlădescu-Răcoasa, the Romanian Secretary for National Minorities. Cohen places him among the PER group leaders attending a meeting with PNȚ leaders, including Maniu, ""around October 1944"". The Zionists wanted Maniu's support for overturning all antisemitic legislation; they were largely disappointed, in that Maniu endorsed positive discrimination in favor of the ""Romanian element"". Also according to Cohen, in May–July 1945 WJC pressed for a merger between the PER and the UER, with Zissu as honorary president, Wilhelm Filderman as active chairman, and Benvenisti as co-chairman.The 1944–1947 period brought Romania under institutional control by the Romanian Communist Party (PCR), which presented the Zionists with opposition from the left—manifested as the PCR-affiliated Jewish Democratic Committee (CDE). Benvenisti recounts having been approached by the CDE's original cell, formed around M. H. Maxy and Lică (Abramovici) Chiriță, ""immediately after August 23"". They wanted him to direct ""Zionist elements that are thought of as democratic"" into an umbrella group. The project stalled until 1945, when he realized that Maxy had established the CDE without consulting him at all. In a report presented by the Committee to the Siguranța on June 22, 1946, both Benvenisti (as ""interim president"" of the PER) and Zissu (still the WJC branch leader) were described as ""centrists"". Cohen suspected that Benvenisti embraced the rhetoric of cooperation with ""democratic forces"" (namely, communism) only for tactical reasons, since he would have known these to be incompatible with the Zionist agenda.Benvenisti himself claimed to have embraced a ""left-wing orientation [...] from back during the war."" This was influenced by his contacts with Mella Iancu, a Labor Zionist, and veered into support for a ""people's democracy""; Benvenisti boasted his participation in collecting funds for the International Red Aid. At a March 1945 speech in front of the Zionist group Dor Hadash, he noted that Zionism enjoyed support from the world's ""most radically progressive circles"", variously including the Communist Party USA and the Soviet trade unions; Zionism, he claimed at the time, would solve the ""Jewish Question"", leaving ""fascist circles"" to reveal themselves ""for their true, unmasked, self: enemies of democracy, proving that we Jews were but their mere pretext."" In February 1946, Benvenisti criticized the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry, arguing that Palestinian issues could only be solved with Soviet input. He later explained that he viewed the Soviet government as Zionism and Israel's one true ally, since the ""Jewish bourgeoisie was never fully committed to creating this state [of Israel]."" On May 11, 1946, he was a witness for the prosecution at Mihai Antonescu's trial by the People's Tribunal, where he spoke of deportations in Tansnistria as amounting to an ""extermination regime"", concluding that over 270,000 Jews had been killed under the Antonescus.On May 1, 1946, Benvenisti had been unanimously elected head of the Zionist Executive, taking over from Rohrlich (who had successfully ousted Zissu in autumn 1945). Under his mandate, the Executive embarked on a conflict with the Revisionist Zionists, whom he declared to be dangerously far-right. On July 23, Benvenisti attended a CDE-coordinated meeting of various groups, which focused on discussing the prospects of ""common political action""; he was a representative of the Executive, with the PER represented by Isaia Tumarkin. He was also a delegate at the WJC conferences in Paris (summer 1946), Basel, Karlovy Vary, and Zürich (all 1947). During the first of these, accompanied by the CDE's Maxy, Benvenisti met Mapai's leader David Ben-Gurion and Moshe Sneh of the Haganah. In one account of his meetings, he claims to have only discussed politics with Sneh, telling him of ""the gratitude that Jews in Romania feel toward the Soviet Union"". As he recalls, he repeated these guidelines at Zürich—when he argued that Romanian Jews had had their problems solved by the new regime, and that mass immigration was no longer desired. According to Benvenisti, his report was heard ""with interest"" by the likes of Sneh, Eliyahu Dobkin, and Nahum Goldmann. Elsewhere, Benvenisti acknowledges that his contacts with Ben-Gurion and Léon Blum were centered on obtaining help for more emigration to Palestine. Nominally, he was by then a supervisor of the Zionist press department (which consisted largely of wall newspapers and hectographed bulletins), but delegated this business to Moscovici. The latter supported the Jewish revolt in Palestine, which led him to be investigated by the Allied Commission.On July 7, 1946, the PER had deposed Zissu; a leadership committee took over. It comprised Ebercohn, Wilhelm Fischer, Doctor Harschfeld, Cornel Iancu, Leon Itzacar, Iakerkaner, Edgar Kanner, M. Rapaport, Rohrlich, Leon Rozenberg, Rosenthal, and Tumarkin. After Zissu agreed to relinquish chairmanship on July 21, Benvenisti became interim president, appointing S. Segall as the PER's new secretary. These developments reportedly alarmed Wilhelm Filderman, who asked Cohen to help the Zionist right with resuming control of the PER and curb its infiltration by communism. Zissu discusses Benvenisti's continued Zionism, but views it as entirely in line with the moderate version advanced at the WJC by Chaim Weizmann. He alleges that Cohen and Benvenisti were drawn into an alliance with each other by Zissu's own criticism of Weizmann. He blames them for conspiring to strip him of his editorial position at Mântuirea magazine, which was subsequently assigned to be managed by Cohen. The latter reports that Benvenisti ""kept in contact with the CDE and the UER regarding the party's demands [from the Romanian political establishment]"". Cohen notes having maintained his own grievances against Benvenisti, which led him to resign from his position as general secretary of WJC Romania in early 1947.


=== Zionist ban ===
In preparation for the general elections in November 1946, the CDE, UER, and PER established a ""Jewish Representation"", which ran as a minor ally of the PCR's governing coalition, itself called Bloc of Democratic Parties (BPD). During Benvenisti's visit to Paris, the PER endorsed Rohrlich as its parliamentary candidate—according to Benvenisti's own reading of this event, Rohrlich took the nomination because he was much less friendly toward the CDE than he himself was. Though he resented his colleagues for having upstaged him, he opted to continue as the party chairman. In March 1947, Benvenisti also went public with his critique of BPD Prime Minister Petru Groza, accusing him of tolerating antisemitism and of doing very little towards addressing Jewish grievances. He responded to allegations (denied by Groza) according to which various ministers wanted to make ""the solution of the Jewish problem in Rumania conditional upon securing $100,000,000 from American Jews for the relief of non-Jews in the famine area of Rumania"". According to Benvenisti: ""If there is anybody who must pay a price of reconciliation in Rumania it is not the Jewish people but the Rumanians who partly committed and partly tolerated the crimes against Jews."" As the Siguranța reported, his speech saw ""participants frantically applauding all points that reflected any grievances of the Jewish population.""Groza met with Benvenisti on several occasions, when he repeated reassurances that he would not stand in the way of emigration. As reported by Rabbi Șafran, in April Benvenisti intervened to ask Wilhelm Filderman not to speak at a Zionist rally; shortly after, Filderman defected from Romania, having been informed of his pending arrest. Benvenisti and Șafran now met each other daily, with the former showing himself to be a ""pragmatic psyche, ready to adapt himself to the new realities."" The final days of 1947 saw the PCR and the BPD reestablishing Romania as a communist republic. Benvenisti spoke of the PER as having been voluntarily dissolved at some point in 1947, after talks between himself and CDE man Bercu Feldman. He declared himself opposed to the Zionist Executive's involvement in organizing illegal transports of Jews to Palestine, citing cases in which refugees became victims of human-trafficking cartels and gangs of robbers; he also argued that many Jews could do better in Romanian society than as ""pensioners"" of The Joint. He recalled that he once denounced Ihud members for tolerating clandestine emigration cells, which the party was then forced to purge out of its ranks. During the legislative election of March 1948, he ""supported the election of regime-backed candidates in speeches, articles, and manifestos.""Benvenisti resigned from the Executive on May 30, 1948, leaving it to elect a new leadership. On that occasion, he had attempted to get the Romanian Zionists to express support for collaboration between all Zionist groups and the Maki (Israel's communist party). As Moscovici notes, he was pushed out by the Mishmar faction, who, while espousing a left-wing agenda, was also interested in speeding up mass emigration for Jewish workers. Winning backing from Ihud, they imposed a triumvirate presidency: Iakerkaner, Chaim Kraft, and Simon ""Shmuel"" Zalman. Benvenisti continued to be engaged with the Zionist circles months after that date, and endorsed the notion that a ""small number"" of Jews could still leave Romania. He looked forward to joining them to ""work for the progressive idea"" in Israel, expecting that he would be welcomed into Maki ranks. He had filed a request to emigrate shortly before his resignation.Benvenisti and Isaia Tumarkin still represented the Romanian Jews at the WJC Congress in Montreux (June–July 1948)—they were given approval to leave after first agreeing to be joined there by nine CDE men, including Feldman. News of this agreement infuriated Zissu; he accused Benvenisti of ""national treason"". He alleged that the CDE wished to spy on the WJC for his communist patrons, or, alternatively, that it was interested in forcing Montreux delegates to take a pro- or anti-communist position, which would have compromised the Romanian movement. Both Benvenisti and the other WJC Committee members were reportedly in agreement that it was ""too late"" for the nine delegates to be disinvited. Zissu claims that, upon returning from Montreux, Benvenisti declared his delegation to have been ""the most important and most subtle political act I ever undertook."" Benvenisti himself recalled that his speech at Montreux was about how ""we [the Jews] must stand with the Soviet Union alongside the people's democracies. [...] the Jewish people must reshape its life into a system of productive labor, alongside the Soviet Union."" He reportedly directed the WJC's left-wing in boycotting the American delegation, since it included no Jewish communists.At some point in late 1948, Romania's Minister of Internal Affairs, Teohari Georgescu, informed Jewish allies, including Benvenisti, of his decision to ban all Zionist groups. In their face-to-face meeting, Georgescu reportedly spoke of Zionists, and especially the HH, as a nuisance which ""prevents the people from fitting into society"". In subsequent interrogations, Benvenisti claimed have personally engaged the HeHalutz in order to dismantle their provincial networks, receiving some assistance from Feldman. The period saw a first wave of repression by the new secret police, called Securitate. Interrogated by the latter in 1952, Cohen confessed that Benvenisti helped Zionist prisoners by appealing to members of the PNȚ underground, namely Gheorghe Zane and Emil Hațieganu. In similar circumstances, Benvenisti himself noted that he had maintained only ""very vague and very infrequent"" relations with Zionist activists after their movement had come to be repressed.Benvenisti took pride in observing that the WJC maintained a presence in Romania until June 1950, despite having been chased almost entirely out of the Eastern Bloc. According to Benvenisti, the decision to maintain it in place was taken between himself and Feldman, much to the chagrin of the Israeli Ambassador, Reuven Rubin. He served as WJC chapter president throughout the interval, with Litman as his second-in-command. Moscovici argues that Benvenisti and Feldman hoped to attract communist Jews into that organization, which, in reality, was ""a simple bureau, employing 2 or 3 clerks."" Benvenisti recalled making a single visit to the Israeli Embassy in Bucharest, on Independence Day 1949; here, he conversed with Rubin and his counsel Moshe Averbuch Agamy, informing them of his objections ""as to how the Israeli government has oriented itself"". He also met with Rubin and Averbuch Agamy on another occasion ""early in 1949"", reportedly to inform them that the Romanian state was right to be fully compensated by the Jewish National Fund. He speculated that achieving this would result in the liberation of Zionist political prisoners, including Leon Itzacar. Zissu similarly confirmed that his rival was not involved in the anti-regime underground, though he passed on messages from Zissu to Rubin's subordinate Eliezer Halevy. Also according to Zissu, Benvenisti was tutoring Halevy's children and his dentist Wrankel in Hebrew.


=== Communist imprisonment and release ===
Benvenisti managed to survive a political purge which took place in 1950 at Ilfov's bar association. In March or April of that year, he applied at the Embassy for an extension of his entry visa to Israel, hoping to receive his Romanian passport, allowing him to leave the country. He admitted to have engaged Halevy in conversation on that and several other occasions. Suzana, unemployed by 1947, found work at the WJC and helped her husband with documentation for Averbuch Agamy (though she reportedly regarded Israeli diplomats as ""imperialists""); by 1948, she had switched to a position in the Romanian state bureaucracy, at the Nicolae Bălcescu Cultural Fund, and in February 1949 was working as a typist for the Israeli Embassy. The Securitate was expanding on its actions against the Zionists, with Cohen and Cornel Iancu targeted by June. As the former recalls, they had tried to warn Benvenisti that he could expect the same outcome. Under interrogation, Moscovici alleged that Suzana was passionate about getting Ben-Gurion's government to rescue the Zionist groups, pleading with her superiors at the Embassy to advocate the issue on her behalf.The Benvenistis were living in an apartment on Republicii Boulevard, 37 when Mișu was arrested on July 10, 1950. He was held at the Interior Ministry building to early August, and then moved to ""the basement of a large villa"" until October, and possibly kept in Malmaison prison in October–December. Benvenisti was first interrogated on August 14 by a Securitate team known to have been led by Lieutenant Major Gheorghe Rujan, but whose other members remained entirely anonymous. Comparing these records with parallel testimonies provided by Zionist Smaya Avny-Steinmetz, Wexler and Popov also argue that Benvenisti was tortured ""liberally"" after that date, in what was an attempt to extract his confession to have spied for Israel. They believe that such treatment would explain Benvenisti's subsequent health problems. On September 21, 1950, ""after 73 days of inquiry"", he still maintained that he owed his arrest to ""a slanderous or knavish action by some enemy of mine"".Over the following days, Benvenisti recanted his earlier confessions about his 1949 meetings with Averbuch Agamy, agreeing with the Securitate that these were meant for Zionist purposes: Benvenisti and Mella Iancu were asked to handle Israeli aid for the Romanian Jews; he refused, since he believed the aid was tied to the emigration policy. During these early sessions, Benvenisti was asked about his contacts with Foreign Minister (and communist factional leader) Ana Pauker—possibly because her rivals were preparing to implicate her in the scandal. Benvenisti reported no direct encounters, though he notes that Averbuch Agamy was discussing Jewish emigrations with Pauker. On June 18, 1951, Securitate Lieutenant Aurel Manu, who had been introduced as Benvenisti's second case worker, staged a confrontation between Benvenisti and Lecca. The latter presented a version of wartime events in which Benvenisti was ""not a defender of the Zionists, not of the Jews [at large], but a defender of his own existence and his very own pocket."" This was followed on June 21 by another such confrontation, one between Zissu and Benvenisti. The two men displayed their contempt for each other—though they still presented similarly negative portrayals of Lecca.During December 1951, Benvenisti was moved back to a cell at the Ministry of the Interior. Again interrogated, he agreed with the charge of wartime collaborationism, noting that his actions had been detrimental to the ""working-class people"" of Romania. He fully caved in on January 4, 1952, when he gave a false confession to having spied for international Zionism. He claimed to quote from memory a letter once received from Tabacinic-Sunea, who had fled to Istanbul. As Wexler and Popov note, the supposed document integrated terminology that ""no Western intelligence service would have been caught using"", and contained orders for Benvenisti to send Tabacinic-Sunea newspaper clippings ""which is to say publicized material that anyone would have had access to, in a free country."" Genuine elements in this confession referred to his having sent abroad fragments from the official newspapers (including Monitorul Oficial, Timpul, Curentul and Universul) and photographs by Fred Șaraga, all of which referred to the Bucharest and Iași pogroms of 1941. Benvenisti also claimed that Averbuch Agamy was blackmailing him into spying, by pretending not to care about Itzacar's ultimate fate. In March, when asked to describe his involvement with military intelligence, Benvenisti spoke of his having witnessed the arrival in Bucharest of Soviet-trained units from the Tudor Vladimirescu and HCC Divisions, and of sending Israel information about them being ""very well equipped and highly motivated"". Securitate Colonel Mișu Dulgheru sent this confession to be analyzed by the Bucharest Military Tribunal.Wexler and Popov note that the ""Kafkaesque"" Securitate became invested in presenting Jewish resistance during the Holocaust as in itself evidence of a Zionist spying network. Benvenisti was also able to resist Securitate pressures on at least three counts—he refused to present himself as a paid spy, noting that ""I was a lawyer and made enough money as such""; he also would not incriminate Cohen, and did not confirm the Securitate claim that all Jewish aid societies were foreign spy-rings. By mid-1952, his political friends, including Menahem Fermo, were also picked up, and held together with Benvenisti at Jilava Prison; Zissu was also held there, and, as Fermo reports, would still treat each other as rivals—though they also supported each other by walking hand in hand. Benevnisti alternated between enthusiasm about rebuilding Romanian Zionism and moments of deep depression, in which he contemplated suicide (he and Fermo also talked literature, and in particular Marcel Proust). According to Securitate records, all interrogations ceased from October 1952 to January 1953, which, Wexler notes, was a means of exercising ""psychological pressure"" on Benvenisti. Suzana Benvenisti was tried on November 13, 1953, alongside Litman; she had been implicated in her husband's affairs by Mella Iancu's testimonies. She was convicted to 10 years in prison, prompting Goldman to issue a formal protest on behalf of the WJC. Suzana's absence reportedly left her mother-in-law destitute; she received a modest sum from the Embassy, which Rohrlich was trying to supplement by December 1951.Benvenisti himself appeared alongside Zissu, Cohen and ten others at a trial in March 1954. He was sentenced to lifetime imprisonment and hard labor. In July 1954, as part of a selective release of the imprisoned Zionists, it was announced that Suzana Benvenisti would be retried by a civilian court. The following year, on Yom Kippur, her husband has slipped into a diabetic coma, and was at a high risk of dying. Reportedly, he obtained medical assistance only because of an intervention on his behalf by Groza's Jewish barber, Max Friedman. On April 14, 1956, shortly before a détente in Israel–Romania relations, the Presidium of the Great National Assembly (then under Constantin Pîrvulescu) pardoned Benvenisti and Zissu together. The new Chief Rabbi, Moses Rosen, was among those involved in negotiating emigration waivers for both men. As he himself noted, the two received their Romanian passports during Rosen's meeting with Deputy Premier Emil Bodnăraș, who reportedly exclaimed: ""They wish to leave, so Mazal tov!""—""as if speaking out loud his thoughts: 'there is no downside to their leaving, godspeed to them'.""Benvenisti began a new stage in his life, as an Israeli diplomat integrated with the Jewish Agency for Israel. Known as ""Moshe Benvenisti"", in October 1946 he traveled with Idov Cohen and others to West Germany, where he negotiated compensation rights for Transnistria deportees—based on the claim that ""Bucharest had been the Nazi center from which the persecution of Jews in all parts of Romania was controlled."" Benvenisti supported this claim by adding that ""he himself had negotiated with agents of the Nazi regime in Bucharest"", and ""brought evidence that the Nazis had a direct influence on the persecution of Jews in Romania."" Before his death in 1977, he established a fund for research into Romanian Jewish history—as noted in 2014 by Moraru, ""nothing is known about what came of [it]."" His widow Suzana died at Ramat Aviv in early 1996; she was aged 89. In November of that year, a memorial plaque for both Benvenistis was put up at Beit Ya'akov Yosef (Zvi Gutman) Synagogue in Tel Aviv.

Stockland Townsville,"Stockland Townsville Shopping Centre is centrally located in Aitkenvale within the urban area of Townsville, Queensland, Australia. The shopping centre is Townsville's largest shopping centre.  In 1987 Stockland Townsville opened after a major upgrade to what was previously known as Nathan Plaza (named after the street the centre runs along). In October 2012 Stockland opened a new 2 level Myer department store, a new Woolworths and mini major, Rebel, plus other specialty stores including a 750-seat foodcourt. The centre is also home to Townsville's first Big W store. Stockland Townsville Kmart Centre (formerly Kmart Plaza & Centro Townsville) was acquired in March 2012 and includes Kmart, Coles and 25 specialty stores.


== Further expansion plans ==
Stockland Group has earmarked its Aitkenvale shopping centre for further development after completion of its present $180 million makeover in 2012. Stockland chief executive commercial property John Schroder said the company was moving ahead with design and planning for an additional 10,000-14,000sq m of floorspace in a new building to be developed on nearby 1.8ha landholding. With a major retailer the additional facility would feature a number of mini-major retailers and a food precinct along its frontage to Elizabeth St.  Development of a cinema complex is also being considered, according to John Schroder's statement at the Myer opening in October 2012.  Stockland has submitted a DA in December 2013 comprising an 8 screen cinema complex over 2 levels, a gym, medical centre and up to 6 restaurants & cafés. This is the 1st stage with other stage/s to follow.  Elizabeth Street will end up being part of a town square which is part of the council plan for the area over the next 20 years. It is expected these stages of the expansion will commence from 2020 on-wards.


== Public transport ==
Stockland Townsville is accessible by bus, and is one of the major bus interchanges on the Translink Townsville network. This is located on Ross River Road at the centre entrance. The taxi interchange is located at the main centre entrance as well.

Trying to Find Chinatown,"Trying to Find Chinatown is a 1996 play by American playwright David Henry Hwang. It deals with issues of racial identity by pitting an Asian street musician against a Caucasian man who claims Asian American heritage.
The Caucasian man is on his way to the house his recently deceased father was born in, which he claims is Chinatown.

My Stroke of Insight,"My Stroke of Insight: A Brain Scientistʼs Personal Journey (2008) is a New York Times bestselling and award-winning book written by Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor, a Harvard-trained neuroanatomist. In it, she tells of her experience in 1996 of having a stroke in her left hemisphere and how the human brain creates our perception of reality and includes tips about how Dr. Taylor rebuilt her own brain from the inside out. It is available in 29 languages.


== Critical reception ==
Desmond O'Neill, M.D. writes in the New England Journal of Medicine, that although the account is gripping and insightful, that it is ""burdened by an interpretation of stroke through the narrow lens of hemispheric function."" He also argues that the advice Taylor gives to stroke patients might not be valuable for all stroke patients.Bert Keizer, a Dutch geriatrician, reviewed the book and described it as ""neurosophy"", where the author sees brain neurons as the foundation for religious experience.


== Publication, editions and bestseller status ==
The book was initially released in October 2006 as a paperback by Dr. Taylor through the self-publishing company Lulu. It was then sold to Clare Ferraro at Viking, an imprint of Penguin Random House, in a dramatic auction conducted by Dr. Taylor's transmedia agent and attorney Ellen Stiefler and published in hardcover by Viking on May 12, 2008 (ISBN 0670020745).
The hardcover edition debuted near the top of the New York Times Non-fiction Hardcover Bestseller list. My Stroke of Insight spent sixty-three weeks on the New York Times Bestseller Lists, reaching number 4.The paperback edition was released May 26, 2009, by Plume (ISBN 0452295548) My Stroke of Insight is also available in electronic e-book, large print and audio book forms.


== Ballet ==
Cedar Lake Ballet Company made a ballet about My Stroke of Insight called Orbo Novo.  The piece's title is drawn from a 1493 reference to North America by Spanish historian Pietro Martire d'Anghiera. But the ""new world"" that Cherkaoui is exploring is current theories about the brain, and the text that the 17 dancers speak during the first moments of the 75-minute work comes from My Stroke of Insight, neuroanatomist Jill Bolte Taylor's uncanny recollection of her stroke. The choreography is based on the ramifications of a single resonant idea: the duality between rationality (the left brain) and instinctive, sensual responses (the right brain); between control and the lack of it; between balance and instability, solitude and society.  ""Thus were the dancers speaking Taylor's words (“My spirit soared free like a great whale gliding through the sea of silent euphoria”), while they physically embodied brain waves and misfiring synapses, with a nod, perhaps, to the double helix:  rubbery splayed limbs; über-arched backs; ever-rippling torsos.""      “‘Orbo Novo’ is a humorous and insightful take on (Taylor’s) story,” said dancer Jubal Battisti. “It has a lot to do with the hemispheres of the brain switching between left and right and what that reveals.”

Tiltfactor Lab,"The Tiltfactor Laboratory is a serious game research center located at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. Its work is centered on critical play an approach that uses games and play to investigate and explain ideas. Outcomes from the lab's work range from scholarly papers and conference presentations to video games, urban games, board games, and performances.  Tiltfactor's motto is ""Game Design for Social Change.""
Tiltfactor is engaged in producing games that combat biases and stereotypes against women in STEM; increase systems-level thinking; model effective bystander intervention in cases of sexual assault; facilitate open source metadata gathering for public institutions; create social networks to encourage altruism and prosocial behavior; and inspire new ways of thinking about health care delivery. They develop board games, card games, sports, urban games, and digital games for a variety of platforms, and publish both qualitative and quantitative research results from their controlled empirical studies.
As of September 2012, Tiltfactor is located in the Black Family Visual Arts Center at Dartmouth. Tiltfactor is supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities, Microsoft Research, the American Council of Learned Societies, and the National Science Foundation, among others.


== History ==
In 2003, Mary Flanagan founded the Tiltfactor Lab while a professor at Hunter College in New York City. Tiltfactor was the first academic game research lab in New York and early work included Rapunsel, a video game to teach young girls computer programming developed in collaboration with researchers at New York University. In 2008 Tiltfactor moved to Dartmouth College when Dr. Flanagan accepted her position as Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Professor in Digital Humanities.


== Selected games ==
Tiltfactor develops games in a variety of media for different audiences. Some of their games include:
POX: SAVE THE PEOPLE – a board game for 1 to 4 people. Players take turns vaccinating or curing members of a population against a disease outbreak. Through play, players understand group immunity and the need to vaccinate.
buffalo – a 20-minute party game where the objective is to name-drop faster than your friends and collect the most cards to win. The game was developed as part of a National Science Foundation funded project called “Transforming Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) For Women and Girls: Reworking Stereotypes & Bias.” The two-year grant has allowed Tiltfactor to develop a number of game designs with additional assistance from the National Girls Collaborative Project, a nationwide organization that wishes to promote gender equity within STEM fields.
Awkward Moment – the game puts 3–8 players in awkward social situations. Players gather a hand of reactions cards and together face embarrassing, or stressful events. Players use decider cards to determine the basis for a winning reaction.
ZOMBIEPOX – A zombie version of Pox, Zombiepox spreads as zombies wander through town biting people. Players help the humans escape by vaccinating them, winning the game if the disease can no longer spread and losing if too many people become full-blown zombies.
POX: Save the Puppies – An extension of the POX game model, Save the Puppies is an Android game for 1–5 players in which players fight the spread of a disease that threatens to take over our pet dog populations. The game is based on the way a typical disease spreads, and players must work to contain the spread of infection by either vaccinating or curing puppies. While the game's disease is fictitious, it is based on a very real disease, Canine parvovirus.
Metadata Games – A collection of online casual games designed to help digital archivists organize visual libraries. Players tag photos, helping to increase the usefulness of image libraries.Entangled - a virtual reality video game where players take on the role of Dr. Smith, a physicist in a science fiction world who can manipulate objects in multiple dimensions. The player uses their skills to travel through the same science lab but in many different dimensions, escaping pursuit by a shadowy enemy. Entangled has been played at the 2019 BostonFIG Fest.
The Enchanter - a digital, point-and-click adventure computer game. Players take on the role of Gertie, a potion-making character, in a fictional world where she encounters and overcomes a range of gender-related obstacles.
Replay Health –  a role-playing sport where players must balance performing physical activities to score points with trying to monitor and improve their character's health. The game takes less than an hour to play, and it fosters player empathy and understanding for the many major decision points in the healthcare system.
Leechwyves and Bonesetters – an active roleplaying game in which players combat plague in medieval Europe, play groups work collaboratively to make their fiefdom the wealthiest and least plague-ridden in the land. Players are assigned characters with their own strengths and weaknesses. Each round, they must balance the goal of working their manor lord’s land with the need to visit the leechwyfe or the bonesetter to keep themselves plague-free.
Layoff – players assume the role of corporate management planning jobs cuts. In a mechanic similar to Bejewled, players match identical types of workers in groups in order to lay the workers off and increase profits. Layoff was developed in collaboration with the Rochester Institute of Technology and launched in the spring of 2009 amid significant economic turbulence in the United States. The game garnered significant attention and was played over a million times within its first week.Vexata – Tiltfactor's first board game is designed to help middle school students develop their game literacy. Players move around the board landing on different category spaces that express either positive values such as ""cooperation"" or negative ideas such as ""prejudice."" Each square has a game mechanic associated with it that expresses its particular value or idea. By moving around the game board, players experience and learn how game mechanics can express ideas and values.
Massively Multiplayer Mushu – players use food to explore new neighborhoods, languages and cultures. Players have a number of cards with ingredients written in a variety of languages other than English. To discover what the ingredients are, players must approach strangers and ask them to help translate the ingredients. Points can also be accumulated by interviewing strangers about food-related stories and opinions, and even by convincing a stranger to return to the post-game dinner. MMM and MMS have been played at the 2008 Conflux festival, the 2009 Come Out & Play festival, and on their own.Grow-A-Game – Developed as part of the  Values At Play project, Grow-A-Game cards are a game and game design tool that help novices understand how games express ideas and help designers be more intentional about the ideas their games communicate. Also available for iPad and iPhone.
The Adventures of Josie True – Though its development began in 1999, years before Dr. Flanagan founded Tiltfactor, The Adventures of Josie True has continued to be maintained by Tiltfactor. The game was designed with four goals in mind: to increase the time 9 to 11-year-old girls spend using technology, promote heroes from under-represented groups, increase math and science skills, and change misconceptions about math, science, and technology in order to encourage girls to pursue those fields. Evaluation indicated that it accomplished its goals, effectively changing players' attitudes and increasing their interest in math, science and technology.


== Selected research projects ==
Using the critical play methodology, Tiltfactor investigates games and play culture, uses games and play as research tools, and designs games and playful events based on findings from research. Some of Tiltfactor's research projects include, but are not limited too:

Eurybrachidae,"Eurybrachidae (sometimes misspelled ""Eurybrachyidae"" or ""Eurybrachiidae"") is a small family of planthoppers with species occurring in parts of Asia, Australia and Africa. They are remarkable for the sophistication of their automimicry.


== Etymology ==
The family name is derived from the Greek ευρος (euros) and βραχυς (brachus), meaning ""broad"" and ""short"". This presumably reflects the shape of adults of representative species.


== Description ==
Eurybrachidae generally resemble related families of planthoppers in the Fulgoromorpha. They are moderate-sized insects, generally 1 to 3 cm long when mature, but they are unobtrusive and camouflaged with brown, grey or green blotches, mimicking foliage, bark or lichens. Their mottled camouflage patterns are most intense on the large forewings of many species, hiding the broad and often aposematically colourful abdomen.
The frons of the head is characteristic, being broader than it is long.

			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


== Biology ==
Eurybrachidae generally are sap-suckers of trees or shrubs. In Australia, the genus Platybrachys associates with Eucalyptus trees, while the genera Olonia and Dardus associate with Acacia.
Each eurybrachid female is likely to have an adult lifespan of some months, during which she lays several clutches of eggs. Females of many species deposit the eggs in clusters on bark or the undersides of leaves, placed in a fingerprint sized patch of white waxy material, covered by a white capsule that protects them from many predators. However, small parasitoid wasps are adapted to attack the eggs by piercing the capsules with their ovipositors, and some species of beetles, such as some Coccinellidae will chew through the capsule and eat the eggs if they find a clutch.The nymphs, being less agile than the adults, rely on mimicry, camouflage for direct protection. However, they also secrete honeydew that attracts ants. The ants in turn protect them from wide varieties of predators and parasitoids.
The southeast Asian genus Ancyra is well known for the adult insects having a pair of prolonged filaments at the tips of the forewings; the wings are folded back when the insect is not in flight, so that the tips with their attached filaments are at the posterior end. The tips arise near a pair of small glossy spots; this creates the impression of a pair of antennae, with corresponding ""eyes"", a remarkable example of automimicry. The ""false head"" effect is further reinforced by the bugs' habit of walking backwards when it detects movement nearby, so as to misdirect predators to strike at its rear, rather than at its actual head, and to strike in the anticipated direction of leaping, whereas the insect jumps in the opposite direction, away from the false head and initial direction of movement.
Other genera, including many African, Asian, and Australasian species, have closely analogous habits, but the automimicry occurs in the wingless nymphs instead of the winged adults. The pseudo-antennae of such nymphs are attached to the sub-posterior dorsal surface of the abdomen of the wingtips. The structure is visible in some of the illustrations in this article. The adults lack the pseudo-antennae, as may be seen for example for example in the illustration of Paropioxys jucundus.  When the nymphs with the posterior pseudo-antennae are disturbed they wave them and walk backwards towards the threat in much the same way as the adults of Asiatic species that have filaments on their wingtips. Such nymphs similarly leap in misleading directions when sufficiently alarmed. However, not all species are equipped for that characteristic automimicry; in some genera, such as Eurybrachys, whether this genus is correctly taxonomically assigned or otherwise, the nymphs bear caudal tufts of bristles such as one typically finds in other families of the Fulgoroidea.


== Taxonomy ==
The oldest known Eurybrachid is from the middle Eocene of Messel. The fossil genus Amalaberga is not placeable within the modern classification in two subfamilies Platybrachinae and Eurybrachinae.

== Pest status ==
Most Eurybrachidae are not regarded as pests, but like many families of plant sucking Hemiptera, they do include some species of concern. For example, Eurybrachys tomentosa is regarded as a pest of tropical Asian forestry, causing damage in plantations of sandalwood and Calotropis.

Stephan Roll,"Stephan Roll (pen name of Gheorghe Dinu, also credited as Stéphane, Stefan or Ștefan Roll; June 5, 1904 – May 14, 1974) was a Romanian poet, editor, film critic, and communist militant. An autodidact, he played host to the Romanian avant-garde at his father's dairy shop, publishing his work in short-lived reviews and in two volumes of poetry. As one of the editors of the magazine unu, he turned from Constructivism, Futurism and jazz poetry to the more lyrical format of Surrealism. Roll's political radicalism seeped into his avant-garde activity, and produced a split inside the unu group; Roll's faction discarded Surrealism in favor of proletarian literature, and affiliated with the underground Romanian Communist Party.
An antifascist who supported groups such as Amicii URSS and promoted Soviet viewpoints, Roll worked on various leftist periodicals, including those of the Adevărul group and Cuvântul Liber. He kept a low profile during World War II, when he was employed by the daily Timpul, discreetly expressing his criticism of Nazi Germany, later contributing to the clandestine România Liberă. Reemerging under the Romanian communist regime, he became a propagandist and, in his final years, worked on reducing the avant-garde content of his debut works, republishing them in altered editions. He was survived by his painter wife, Medi Wechsler-Dinu.


== Biography ==


=== Early life and unu years ===
Roll was a native of Prekopana village in the Ottoman Empire's Manastir Vilayet; today, this is Perikopi in the Florina regional unit of Greece. His parents were Bulgarian peasants: Enache Dinu, a komitadji who fled to Bucharest in 1907, and his wife Paraschiva. His formal education consisted of four grades at the Bulgarian school in Bucharest from 1911 to 1915. As his letters show, he always had difficulties writing proper Romanian, and devised his own spelling of various words.Dinu spent his youth in a multicultural environment, spending time in the Romanian Jewish neighborhoods, and acting as the shabbos goy, preserving links with the Zionist A. L. Zissu. From 1915 to 1929, he worked as a shop boy at his father's dairy, Lăptăria Enache (or Secolul), near the Bucharest Bărăția. His links with radical left-wing circles were documented from late 1921, when Siguranța, the Romanian Kingdom's secret police, was informed of his possible connections with the terrorist Max Goldstein.During the 1920s, Enache's shop became a meeting place for avant-garde poets and artists such as Victor Brauner (who painted its exterior), Ilarie Voronca, and Sașa Pană. Inspired by the more senior poet Ion Vinea, the group stated its allegiance to Constructivism, and published in Vinea's Contimporanul. Together with Voronca and Brauner, Roll edited 75 H.P. magazine, which appeared for one number in October 1924. Later, he and Voronca joined Scarlat Callimachi's Punct. He signed his articles with his birth name, and his poetry as Stephan Roll, a pen name he allegedly picked up at random from a Swiss magazine, after noting that he was the only non-pseudonymous writer of his intimate circle.Dinu worked as an editor for Integral magazine (1925–1928), where he also made his debut as a film critic, alongside Benjamin Fondane and Ion Călugăru. While visiting Câmpina in 1927, Roll met the aspiring poet Geo Bogza, who had read his Contimporanul pieces, and helped him to launch another avant-garde periodical, Urmuz (to which he also contributed). They were joined in Bucharest by the draftsman Jules Perahim, who was aged fifteen at the time, and later also by Sandu Eliad and M. H. Maxy.From 1928 to 1932, Roll edited the magazine unu, and, according to Pană, was the ""quicksilver""-like animator of its literary club. However, he also wrote for Meridian and Facla. By 1930, he and his unu colleagues had signed up to international Surrealism, and were especially interested in cultivating its automatic writing technique. As noted by Pană, Roll took this affiliation seriously, spontaneously experimenting with absurdist humor. He ""very seriously"" recounted stories of pseudo-zoology to an audience of fellow tram riders, insisting that giraffes owed their elongated necks to a diet of drain spouts. During that episode, unu hosted outsider literature by Petre Poppescu, a psychiatric inmate, as well as cut-out obituaries from the mainstream press. Also featured were drawings by Brauner with captions by Roll, such as their posthumous homage to Serafina, Roll's she-dog, whom he had trained to lash out at conformist authors who happened to be visiting Enache's dairy. His defense of the avant-garde led him to publish passionate pieces in defense of Bogza, who was facing trial for his highly erotic collection, Jurnal de sex, a ""simulated hymn of voluptuousness and shamelessness, of a sadistic dairy, of spasm and organic inebriation"".


=== Communist schism ===
According to scholar Paul Cernat, Roll and Pană publicized their ""superficial adhesion"" to Surrealism only because it provided expression to their dreams of political revolution. Cernat notes the same for two other unu writers, Miron Radu Paraschivescu and Claude Sernet. Already during the 1930 Bogza trial, Roll drew parallels between the calls for artistic censorship and the rise of fascism. Soon, the unu group severed its links with Vinea and Contimporanul: the latter was becoming more mainstream, more eclectic, and more tolerant of ""reactionary"" figures such as Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Sandu Tudor, and Mihail Sebastian. In unu, Vinea was attacked as an ""Old Man"", his Constructivism denounced as opportunistic and ""utilitarian"". The group won a victory over Vinea by obtaining foreign support: Roll published in Der Sturm an introduction to Romanian Surrealism, followed by samples from Bogza, Fondane, Pană, and other poets. Reportedly, the moderate Der Sturm had to insist that unu radicals grant it this favor.For his closeness to the banned Romanian Communist Party (PCdR), Roll was under constant Siguranța surveillance. He opened the magazine to PCdR cadres, publishing a book of poems by Ion Vitner, which was swiftly confiscated by the authorities. Roll had a difficult relationship with his nominal protege Bogza, offering him advice that Bogza ignored. The dairy shop went bankrupt and was eventually sold to another Bulgarian family, allegedly because Dinu supplied free meals to destitute clients.Over the following months, Romanian Surrealism suffered a crisis, as the left-wing faction sought to expel the apolitical ones from its ranks. By 1931, Roll was writing in unu open praises to ""robust life"" in the Soviet Union, contrasting its five-year plans with the Great Depression. Soon after, Roll made a decisive contribution to excluding Voronca from the unu group for publishing a collection with an ""official"" press and applying for membership in the Romanian Writers' Society. He then attacked Surrealism itself: ""yesterday's metaphysics"", he noted in unu, ""must be channeled into present-day scientific materialism"". In his letters of the period, Voronca noted that Roll worked to destroy his and Bogza's reputation, drawing Pană closer to his communist circle. Bogza, meanwhile, sided with Voronca, which led to a definitive split. At the time, Roll also publicized his love for Marxism in his letters to the Fondane, reproaching him his ""lack of a firm stance"" and ""refuge in an unreal world"". In an early 1933 article for Cuvântul Liber, Roll expressed his support for Louis Aragon, calling Surrealism a ""false avant-garde"" as long as it did not tap into ""the anarchic economic structure of society"".


=== Between Cuvântul Liber and Reporter ===
In December 1932, Pană put out a final, suicidal, issue of unu. Roll, who remained close friends with the avant-garde reporter F. Brunea-Fox, went on to edit the newspapers Adevărul and Dimineața. From 1934 to 1938, he also put out Cuvântul Liber, signing up to the Amicii URSS society, which was a front for the PCdR. In his own definition, Cuvântul Liber stood for ""the progressive left during those years of fascist exacerbation"". However, Răzvan Voncu claims that, going far beyond the antifascist commitment of his unu colleagues, Roll established links with the Soviet espionage and acted as their agent of influence. PCdR records show that he was viewed with suspicion, a ""fractionist"" who supposedly wanted the party leadership purged of its non-Romanian cadres.In 1934, following a clampdown on Iron Guard fascism and the PCdR alike, Roll complained to Fondane that ""all publications are now being sieved through military censorship."" During that year, he wrote in support of the communist unionists who were on trial for the Grivița railway strike, working with the International Red Aid and enlisting support from intellectuals such as Alexandru Ciucurencu and Jószef Meliusz. He also made occasional returns to cultural polemics, issuing a political critique of the Contimporanul artist Marcel Janco, and, befriending folklorist Harry Brauner, was among the first to hear and encourage Maria Tănase, who became Romania's leading recording star.Around 1936, a card-carrying member of the PCdR, Dinu involved himself in rallies supporting jailed communists Iorgu Iordan and Petre Constantinescu-Iași. He was also a contributor to N. D. Cocea's Era Nouă, a PCdR-backed review, introducing the public to revolutionary works by Geo Milev. He later joined Cocea's Reporter magazine, where he contributed the film column, written from a Marxist and anti-consumerist perspective. In 1936, he and Paraschivescu were guest editors at Korunk, the Hungaro–Romanian Marxist review, publishing therein his essay on ""The Formation of Romanian Intellectuals"", and contributions by Tudor Arghezi, Belu Zilber, Ghiță Ionescu, Stoian Gh. Tudor, and Alexandru Sahia.In 1937, he participated in the campaign for free speech mounted by Zaharia Stancu's Azi newspaper, defending the avant-garde's Bogza and H. Bonciu against accusations from the nationalist far-right. Also that year, he founded the satirical review Pinguinul, described by Siguranța as a ""camouflaged communist organ"". Publishing art by Perahim and Brauner, and texts by Bogza, it was forcefully closed down after putting our four issues. For a while, Roll entertained the idea of relaunching it under the name Pitpalacul.From 1938 to 1940, Roll edited Stancu's Lumea Românească newspaper, where he continued to press for antifascism, alongside Bogza, George Macovescu, Petru Manoliu, and various others. Although connected with the PCdR and accepting its instructions, it was more closely aligned with the Radical Peasants' Party. During its brief existence, it published Bogza's counterattack on the traditionalists such as Stelian Popescu, exposing pornographic traits in their own press. Roll carried on with his attack on Surrealism and automatism: having already hosted Soviet attacks on psychoanalysis at Cuvântul Liber, he wrote a critical obituary for Sigmund Freud in Azi (October 1939). It denounced Freudism as the ""opium of the people"", a distraction from ""revolutionary ardor"".


=== World War II and after ===
In 1940, Roll transferred to Mircea Grigorescu's Timpul daily, his main place of employment to 1947. With the start of World War II fascism and Romania's alliance with Nazi Germany, he hid his political commitments. Sometimes with Grigorescu's blessing, he and other crypto-communists (Paraschivescu and Macovescu) published texts that hinted at their support for the Allied Powers. He was in a relationship with Medi Wechlser, a Jewish painter whom he had met ca. 1934. The racial laws prevented them from getting married, and banned Medi from artistic life.During the National Legionary regime, Roll extended his protection to a hunted communist sympathizer, George Ivașcu. In 1943, he became one of the main contributors to Ivașcu's clandestine newspaper, România Liberă, signaling his closeness to the underground Union of Patriots. According to Dinu's own account, the newspaper was planned in his own home, with support from Medi, Macovescu, and Tereza Ungár-Macovescu.In his forties, Stephan Roll emerged as an important figure among communist writers, and, as noted by critic Ion Pop, ""enrolled himself heart and soul in support of propaganda"". Shortly after the pro-Allied coup of August 1944, he rallied with the Romanian Society for Friendship with the Soviet Union, and became co-editor, with Athanase Joja, Simion Oeriu and Petre Pandrea, of its Veac Nou magazine. He wrote enthusiastic reportage pieces of his travels in the Soviet Union, including a chronicle of the Tbilisi—Spartak derby and interviews with homecoming Romanian POWs. His stated conclusion was that the ""Soviet man"" was ""the first-class citizen of the coming world"". With Stancu and Paraschivescu, he was a witness for the prosecution at the trial of journalists who had supported fascism, organized by the Romanian People's Tribunals in 1945. However, there is some indication that Roll secretly resented communist policies, in particular the recruitment drive for party cadres. He is credited as having invented the one-liner: Puțini am fost, mulți am rămas (""So very few we were, so many of us remain"").Between 1947 and 1956, under the early communist regime, he edited Munca newspaper and Gazeta Literară magazine. From 1956 to 1967, he was secretary of the Newspapermen's Union. In the 1950s, he married Medi, with Pandrea as their godfather. Their marriage was childless. Dinu-Roll published his retrospective volume in 1968, Ospățul de aur (""Golden Feast""). Prefaced by Alexandru A. Philippide, it made young writers aware that the journalist and the avant-garde poet were one and the same man. However, the pieces published here were toned down by communist censorship and by Roll's own reservations, and some were heavily retouched.Following the writer's death in 1974, his widow Medi recovered and copied the original drafts of his poems, which were published by Macovescu and Eugen Jebeleanu in Gazeta Literară. Ion Pop resumed the editorial work, and in 1986 produced a new edition that was more faithful to the original formats. The project was again taken up after the 1989 Revolution, and, in 2014, Pop ultimately produced an uncensored corpus of Roll's literary contribution. Continuing to paint, Medi made local history when, upon turning 100 in 2008, she exhibited fresh works of art.


== Literary work ==
Roll's poems successively display echoes of the main currents through which the Romanian avant-garde passed. His early ""integralist"" Constructivism, with its hints of Futurism and Dada, produced manifesto-like poems, odes to modern life, and samples of jazz poetry, as well as an homage to the avant-garde cult figure, Urmuz. According to Cernat, they are ""urban-cosmopolitan poems, abundant in ruptures, arbitrariness, and stridency"". Their ""dynamic"" and ""synthetic"" style drew attention from the modernist critic Eugen Lovinescu, who noted that Roll managed to outdo his Futurist masters in ""virtuosity"".Roll's transition to Surrealism brought his recovery of earlier, more classical, poetic models. At unu, he praised the Comte de Lautréamont, Arthur Rimbaud, and Charles Baudelaire. This influence is seen in the 1929 collection Poeme în aer liber (""Outdoor Poetry"") and the prose poems included in the 1930 Moartea vie a Eleonorei (""Eleonora's Living Death""), both of which came with illustrations by Victor Brauner. These more elegiac poems depict the natural universe with sensory freshness, celebrated for a particular ability for conjuring up images, which have playful, ironic and burlesque touches. One of these pieces is Diana, described by Ion Pop as ""one of his most beautiful"" and as proof of Roll's stylistic debt to Ilarie Voronca:

In its various editions, Ospățul de aur collects both poems and essays about his generational colleagues, written in the same poetic style and brimming with imagery. The posthumous collection Baricada din călimară (""A Barricade in the Inkpot"", 1979) sheds light on his activity in the 1930s as a radical-left journalist.According to critic Răzvan Voncu, he endures in cultural memory as ""a second-shelf author, albeit one whose biography and work contain, in effigy, all defining traits of the interwar avant-garde."" Another reviewer, Doris Mironescu, finds him ""mediocre"" and ""entirely unoriginal"". Contrarily, Marin Mincu pays homage to Roll as Romania's ""most authentic avant-garde writer"", finding him superior to poets Mircea Dinescu and Ana Blandiana.

The first part was serialized in Kodansha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Magazine from September 2007 to March 2009, with its chapters collected in eight tankōbon volumes. The second part, Tobaku Haōden Zero: Gyanki-hen was serialized in the same magazine from July 2011 to May 2013, with its chapters collected in 10 volumes. The story revolves around gambling with high stakes, with focus on competition and rivalry. 


== Plot ==
Zero Ukai, a boy who causes a stir as a so-called ""Robin Hood"" of society, is invited along with his friends to the Dream Kingdom, a part-gambling part-amusement park under construction by the wealthy Muryō Zaizen. Zero and the others are brought together because Zaizen is in search of a ""king,"" in other words his rep player, and he puts all his money on the line in order to succeed in that search, with the reward equaling no less than 100 billion yen. In order to save all the victims of the bank transfer scam with the prize money, Zero takes on the challenge to become the king, but the games are nothing short of the ultimate gambles of life, mind and body.


== Characters ==


=== The Participants ===
Zero Ukai (宇海 零, Ukai Zero)
Portrayed by: Shigeaki Kato
He is 17 years old at the start of the series. When he was in middle school, he was an honor student in the extra-advanced class of Kainan Junior High, being one of the three brightest people in the class. He has a clear mind and good athletic nerves, and he can make an accurate judgment of situations even if put in a tight spot. He has an extremely strong sense of justice and considers his three companions to be one and the same as him, and at the same time, he shows kindness to everyone without regard to his own interests, such as offering timely help to Shirube, who was in a direct confrontation with him.
In the live-action TV series, he is changed into a 27–28 year old cram school lecturer, though much of his characteristics remains the same.
Mitsuru Kubo (久保 ミツル, Kubo Mitsuru)
One of Zero's 'robin hood' companions. At first, he was antagonistic towards Zero for stopping him from committing suicide, but by joining Zero's pact, he comes to appreciate the fact that he has changed his life, which he thought was meaningless. While working as a robin hood, he seems to have developed a strong sense of justice, and he hopes to save all the victims of the bank transfer scam when he gets the bounty as a rep player. He does not appear in the live-action TV series.
Yūki (ユウキ)
Portrayed by: Amane Okayama (as Hiroshi Sashima (佐島 ヒロシ, Sashima Hiroshi) in the TV series)
One of Zero's 'robin hood' companions. He wears glasses and has a sullen but mild-mannered personality. Initially, he shows his selfishness and pretends to be aiming for the top like the other participants, but as he experiences the harshness of the games and the greatness of Zero, he becomes convinced that Zero should be the ""king"". As they continued to play the games, Zero advised him that it was dangerous for them to act together any longer, but they decided to continue because he wanted to see Zero through his fate for as long as possible and help him when he could.
In the live-action TV series, his role is taken over by a character named Hiroshi Sashima, who takes on several traits that originally belonged to Suezaki, such as his father being a diplomat.
Hiroshi (ヒロシ)
Portrayed by: Ryō Katō (as Chikara Manabe (真鍋 チカラ, Manabe Chikara) in the TV series)
One of Zero's 'robin hood' companions. He is noticeably more plump than the rest of Zero's friends and appears to have the strongest selfish desires of them all. Like with Yūki, Zero advised him to leave, and he parted ways with Zero in a half-hearted way, despite the fact that he couldn't survive without Zero's help due to his lack of strength. They later reunited in front of the venue for ""The Lost Ring"".
Sakura Suezaki (末崎 さくら, Suezaki Sakura)
Portrayed by: Kendo Kobayashi
A yakuza who is the president of the bank transfer scam group that has been thwarted by Zero and the robin hoods. He was given the right to participate in the ""test to decide the king"" on Zaizen's whims. Despite playing a comic relief role most of the time, he also plays a major supporting role in giving Zero and the others sparks of inspiration. In the second arc, he teamed up with Zero to act as an intermediary for the games and as a manager, preparing the betting money. He also begins to speak mainly in a Kansai dialect.
Itakura (板倉)
Portrayed by: Shotaro Mamiya (as Seigi Suezaki (末崎 セイギ, Suezaki Seigi) in the TV series)
The member of the bank transfer scam group. He is a shrewd, tall man and intellectual-type gangster who graduated from Keio University, and together with Suezaki, he has obtained the right to participate in Zaizen's test. He is treated as a younger brother figure to Suezaki, but perhaps because of Suezaki's own short-tempered nature, he secretly makes fun of him. He seems to respect those who are competent, and despite his aforementioned background, he truly appreciates the abilities of Zero and Shirube, who are younger than him.
Shirube (標)
Portrayed by: Ryūga Satō
A young boy whose real name and exact age are unknown. He is very intelligent and always maintains a composed attitude. At first glance, he appears to be cold, but deep down he holds a passionate desire to change the world, and he is willing to die to do so. He approaches Zero with a secret plan to defeat Zaizen, and promises to fight with him later on. He believes that it is young people like Zero and him who should lead the way in the times, not old people like Zaizen.


=== The Sponsors ===
Muryō Zaizen (在全 無量, Zaizen Muryō)
Portrayed by: Tomio Umezawa
The president of the Zaizen Group. He is Japan's richest man with more than 3 trillion yen in personal assets alone. Known by his nickname ""Money God,"" he is 81 years old and uses a wheelchair. He was the organizer of the ""test to decide the king"" and scraped together blood relatives and influential people from all over Japan as participants. Seeing Zero and the others' qualities, he rescued them from their predicament, but since Zero was too wary to show his gratitude at the time, Zaizen came to dislike him. He has 365 mistresses tending to him on a daily basis, as well as children and grandchildren. Like Hyōdō in the Kaiji series, he is an extremely vicious sadist who takes great pleasure in injuring and killing disqualified people, and seems to value his innate ""luck.""
In the live-action TV series, he is 71 years old and does not show hostility towards Zero as much as in the original manga.
Toneo Gotō (後藤 利根雄, Gotō Toneo)
Portrayed by: Eiko Koike (as Mineko Gotō (後藤 峰子, Gotō Mineko) in the TV series)
An executive of the Zaizen Group. He is 58 years old and the one who facilitates the test to decide the king. He presides over the Dream Kingdom and asks participants to take part in heinous gambles. However, he has never been unreasonable in his judging and acts fairly. He acknowledges that Zero is the best one of all, monitoring and favoring him over the other participants at the same time.
In the live-action TV series, he was changed to a young woman named Mineko Gotō. Although she acknowledges that Zero is one of the best talents in the world, she tends to dislike Zero to an unusual degree.
Jack (ジャック, Jakku)
An old man who Zero fights against in the finger-cutting gamble. As a child, he suffered a serious injury to the right half of his face, which he hides with half his body and hair. In the case of gambling, he claims to have lost only once out of the many gambles he has participated in, and he faces Zero with absolute confidence, but there is a deep secret behind his win rate. He does not appear in the live-action TV series.
Kotarō Shiroyama (城山 小太郎, Shiroyama Kotarō)
Portrayed by: Yuya Tegoshi
The DJ of the anchor gamble who wears clothes that seem to be of the punk fashion. Despite saying that his real name is ""Kotarō Hill Mountain Williams Harrison Jaguar Satake James Shiroyama,"" his driver's license shows the above name. It is assumed by Zero that one of his parents might be American. Although he treats the participants with a friendly manner, in reality he is an ugly man who cannot hide his disgust at typical moving tales, hoping that the gambling process will destroy the bonds between the participating teams.


=== Gyanki-hen ===
Kyōsuke Yūki (結城 京介, Yūki Kyōsuke)
A collegiate golf champion that Zero has to play against in an early morning golf game. He is a nice young man in public, but he looks down on others deep down.
Elizabeth Junko (エリザベス・ジュンコ, Erizabesu Junko)
The self-proclaimed ""Invincible Poker Queen"" who sends a challenge letter to an underworld gambling contracting site set up by Zero. All her teeth, besides the front teeth, are canine. She is self-confident and only listens to reasons that are convenient to her, and takes great pleasure in pulling out all the teeth of the losers in a ""100-card poker"" game that she devised and crafted to her advantage. Her role as an opponent is replaced with Mineko in the TV drama series.
Naoki Hōjō (宝条 直樹, Hōjō Naoki)
A thirteen year old boy who was present at the scene of the beer-pouring match between Zero and the entertainment company president. Impressed by Zero's tact and sense of justice, he asks him to decipher the cryptogram ""Yukichi's Soliloquy,"" which is believed to belong to his grandfather Kijūrō. He doesn't have any particular talent, but he does have a good sense of things.
Sawako Hōjō (宝条 佐和子, Hōjō Sawako)
The senior managing director of Hōō Corporation, one of Japan's top-class giant corporations. She is Kijūrō's eldest daughter and Naoki's mother. She is unclingy by nature and seems to have little interest in her father's wealth, and is also quite an airhead.
Takamitsu Hōjō (宝条 貴光, Hōjō Takamitsu)
The president of Hōō Corporation, he is Kijūrō's eldest son and Sawako's older brother. He proposes that if Yukichi's soliloquy reveals the location of the hidden fortune, the distribution of the fortune will be first come first served, and he attempts to take all of it by using Hōō's ability to get things done and Tatsuki's intellect.
Tatsuki Hōjō (宝条 龍樹, Hōjō Tatsuki)
Takamitsu's son. He is 13 years old, just like his cousin Naoki, but he is a genius who skipped a grade to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in his third year. He believes that humanity's greatest treasure is its intellect, and he dreams of beating Shirube and Zero, who are considered to be the pinnacle of genius. He hears that Zero is trying to decipher Yukichi's soliloquy, so he joins the competition and confronts Zero.
Okajima (岡島)
The senior managing director of Hōō Corporation. He was called founder Kijūrō's right-hand man, and claimed that ""Yukichi's soliloquy"" might be a sign of an SOS from him.
Kijūrō Hōjō (宝条 喜十郎, Hōjō Kijūrō)
The founder of Hōō Corporation. He had been locked up for three years, but he saw through the fact that the culprit was Takamitsu. His age is in his eighties (the same age as Zaizen), but his physical abilities are unimaginable for his age, such as showing Zero and the others a forward somersault immediately after rescue, and claiming that he can do a backward somersault if he is so inclined. In spite of being a wealthy and eccentric person, he is a good man who is adored by everyone, which is a rarity in Fukumoto's works.
Mitsu Hōjō (宝条 美津, Hōjō Mitsu)
The deceased wife of Kijūrō, the mother of Takamitsu and Sawako and the grandmother of Naoki and Tatsuki. She used to have feelings for Zaizen, but when Zaizen became a billionaire and confessed to her, she was already attracted to Kijūrō.

William Morris textile designs,"William Morris (1834-1898), a founder of the British Arts and Crafts movement, sought to restore the prestige and methods of hand-made crafts, including textiles, in opposition to the 19th century tendency toward factory-produced textiles. With this goal in mind, he created his own workshop and designed dozens of patterns for hand-produced woven and printed cloth, upholstery, and other textiles.


== Embroidered textiles ==
The first textile designs Morris made were created in the 1860s and were for embroideries, expressing his interest in medieval arts and crafts, particularly the medieval wall hangings that he admired as a child. In a collection of essays by members of the Arts and Crafts movement published in 1893, he wrote that one of the aims of embroidery should be simply ""The exhibition of beautiful material. Furthermore, it is not worth doing unless it is either very copious and rich, or very delicate - or both.""His first embroidery designs were primitive, but later, working with his wife Jane, he created a set of wall hangings for his residence in the London suburbs, Red House. One of his designs in this historical style, stitched by Jane Morris, won the Morris company an award in an international competition in 1862. Morris and his workshop began making embroideries for the households of his friends as well as larger panels for some of the many new churches being constructed in England. In these designs, Morris created the decorative elements, while his friend Edward Burne-Jones drew the figures, and a team of embroiderers manufactured the work by hand. Other wall hangings were designed to be sold off the shelf of the new Morris and Company shop on Oxford Street which owned in 1877. Later, he and his daughter May made designs for panels for ""embroider yourself"" kits for cushion covers, fireplace screens, doorway curtains, bedcovers and other household objects. In 1885, Morris turned production of embroidery entirely over to his daughter.

			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


== Furnishing textiles and woven fabrics ==
In the late 1860s Morris began to experiment with a genre, textiles for furnishing or upholstery. His first design was jasmine trail or jasmine trellis (1868–70), based on a similar wallpaper design he had made in 1862. In the 1870s, he expanded his activity in woven furnishing textiles. In 1877, he brought a skilled French silk weaver, Jacques Bazin, from Lyon to London, rented a studio at Great Esmond Yard, and established Bazin and his mechanical Jacquard loom there to make woven wooden fabrics.In 1881, he opened new workshops at Merton Abbey, seven miles southwest of London, for manufacturing printed and woven textiles. The workshops were next to the River Wandle, providing a source of abundant clean water, and also had a grassy meadow where dyed clothes could be dried in the open air. He produced a number of furnishing fabrics there, including the Wey and Wandle designs. 

			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


== Printed textiles ==
Morris made his first experiments with printed textiles for his company Morris, Marshall, Faulkner and Co. beginning in 1868, at about the same time he was starting to make printed wallpaper (see William Morris wallpaper designs). These first textiles were recreations of earlier designs he had made from the 1830s, and were printed for Morris by the workshop of Thomas Clarkson of Bannister Hall, in Lancaster. His next textile was Trellis with jasmine (1868–70). This was printed with synthetic analine dyes. Next he made Tulip and Willow, a design he made in 1873, but he was very disappointed by the result. He blamed the problem on the artificial dyes, and began doing research into the natural dyes which had been used in the 16th century.The Strawberry Thief became one of Morris's best-known designs. It depicted a scene from his own garden, where thrushes came to dine upon the ripe strawberries.

			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
Morris moved with his family to Turham Green in 1872, which created greater space in his house at Queen Square in London where Morris had his workshop. Morris and his assistant John Smith made a series of experiments with indigo and other natural dyes, but were unable to attain colours that satisfied Morris. In 1875, Morris tried working with a commercial printer, Wardle and Company, using wood blocks with a reduced number of colours and modern chemical dyes, This time he was dissatisfied with the lack of quality control by the workers, and the uneven results. He therefore decided to establish his own workshop, where he could control everything.He moved his printing workshop to Merton Abbey Mills, near the Merton Abbey Priory. For printed textiles, the design was traced onto a block of pear wood, and then the wood was sculpted so only the desired surface would touch the fabric. Thin strips of brass were pounded edge-first into the block to make the fine lines. One block was used for each colour of the final fabric, The block was inked by placing into a vat of colorant, and then carefully placed onto the fabric on the table in front of the craftsman. He pounded it with a mallet to impress the colour, then he lifted the block carefully, moved the fabric, re-inked the block, and printed the next section with the same colour. When the first colour was finished, the finished fabric was set aside to dry. If more than one colour was used, once the fabric was dry, a block with the next colour would be inked and carefully impressed over the image left by the first. The same process and the same blocks could be used for making both fabrics and wallpaper. Since fifteen or more colours might be used, It was an extremely laborious and long process, sometimes lasting several weeks, and the cost was higher than that of mechanical printing methods.

			
			
		
		
			
			
		


== Tapestries ==
Morris wrote that making tapestries was 'the noblest of all the weaving arts', and most suitable for his interest in reviving medieval arts and crafts. He set up his first tapestry loom in 1877, and made completed his first tapestry, was 'Acanthus and Vine' in (1879). He wove the tapestry himself, often getting up at dawn to work on a loom in his bedroom at Kelmscott House. His design was modelled after the ""large leaf"" tapestries woven in France and Flanders in the 16th century, and he deliberately gave them a faded appearance to make them look two centuries old. He recorded that it took him five hundred sixteen and one half hours to complete. 
Once he had mastered the technique, he created a full-time tapestry workshop at the Morris and Company house on Queen Square. For most of his tapestries, Morris worked with other artists, particularly Edward Burne-Jones, who designed the figures, Philip Webb, who designed birds and animals, and with his primary assistant and successor as chief designer, John Henry Dearle. Burne-Jones made a drawing of the figures first, which was transformed into a color design by Morris or Dearle. A photographic image was made of he design with figures, to which Morris or Dearle added a floral background, and a border equally filled with designs of trees and flowers. The full scale image was transferred onto cloth by rubbing with a piece of ivory, and then woven on a loom. Large-scale tapestries were made in this way at Merton, mostly by the employment of boys ages thirteen and fourteen, who received shelter, board and a daily wage.The most famous tapestries made by Burne-Jones and Morris were Holy Grail tapestries made for William Knox D'Arcy in 1890 for his dining room at Stanmore Hall  Additional versions of the tapestries with minor variations were woven on commission by Morris & Co. over the next decade.
In addition to full-scale tapestries, the Merton Abbey workshop produced smaller works, designed as coverings for cushions and furniture. Multiple copies were made of some popular tapestries. Ten copies were made of The Adoration between 1890 and 1907. 

			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


== Carpets ==
In March, 1875, Morris became the sole owner of what became William Morris Company, buying out the shares of his partners. He decided to diversify the products by adding carpets, a market that was almost totally dominated by original or imitation oriental carpets. Within three months, he had registered his first design for the Cataline floor cloth, a decorative covering for linoleum floors, a material which had been invented in 1855. By December had registered two designs for machine-woven carpets which he had made by the Wilton Royal Carpet Factory.As usual, Morris set a high goal for himself. His aim, he declared, was to make England independent of the Orient for the provision of hand-make carpets which aspire to the status of art. He made a careful study of techniques and materials, and made a series of experiments. When he moved to Kelmscott House in 1879 he began to produce a series of carpets called Hammersmith. He hired a labor force of young women to work on looms he set up in the former stables and garage of his London residence. He also revived the art of hand-knotting for making small carpets.In the 1880s, in addition to the Hammersmith carpets, Morris created series of designs for machine-made Axminster and Kidderminister carpets, made at the Wilton factory or at Heckmondwike Manufacturing company in Yorkshire. Many of the carpets he designed used the patterns he had invented for printed fabrics, but others, particularly the Hammersmith carpets, resembled the designs he made for his woven textiles. His early carpets sometimes borrowed popular oriental motifs. The designs he made for Axminister and Wilton carpets were less lavish in their ornament and more geometrical, to make them more affordable.In 1881 he moved the workshop to Merton Abbey, where there was space to weave much larger carpets commissioned by his clients. His designs for these large Hammersmith carpets moved farther away from the Oriental influence, and took on a more specifically English style. As with his wallpapers other textiles, his inspirations were most often flowers, plants and animals found in English gardens.One particularly notable design was the Bullerswood carpet, was made in 1889 for the wool trader John Sanderson, who had a country residence called Bullerswood in Chislehurst, Kent. Morris made two versions of the carpet for the house, in collaboration with his assistant John Henry Dearle. Extremely complex, they were virtual anthologies of all of the motifs of Morris. Morris made one carpet for the living room and another for the front hallway. He also strictly supervised the decoration of these rooms, so it would be in harmony with the carpet.

			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


== The William Morris style ==
Morris explained his ideas about textile designs in a group of essays by members of the Arts and Crafts movement published in 1893. In his essay on textiles, Morris wrote: ""The aim should be to combine clearness of form and firmness of structure with the mystery which comes of abundance and richness of detail...Do not introduce any lines or objects which cannot be explained by the structure of the pattern; it is just this logical sequence of form, this growth which looks as if, under the circumstances, it could not have been otherwise, which prevents he eye wearying of he repetition of the pattern.""...Do not be afraid of large patterns; if properly designed they are more restful to the eye than small ones...Very small rooms, as well as very large ones, look best ornamented with large patterns.""
""...As final maxims, never forget the material you are working with, and try always to use it for doing what it can do best: if you feel yourself hampered by the material in which you are working, instead of being helped by it, you have so far not learned your business, any more than a would-be poet has, who complains of the hardship of writing in measure and rhyme.""In the same group of 1893 essays, he expressed his views of tapestry designs. He wrote: ""As in all wall decoration, the first thing to be considered in designing of Tapestry is the force, purity and elegance of the silhouette of the objects represented, and nothing vague or indeterminate is admissible. But special excellencies can be expected from it. Depth of tone, richness of colour, and exquisite gradation of tints are easily to be obtained in Tapestry; and it also demands that crispness and abundance of beautiful detail which was the especial characteristic of fully developed Medieval Art. The style of even the best period of the Renaissance is wholly unfit for Tapestry; accordingly, we find that Tapestry retained its Gothic character longer than any other of the pictorial arts.""In writing about textiles, Morris emphasised the importance of using natural dyes and colours. ""These colours in fading still remain beautiful,"" he wrote, ""and even after long wear, never pass into nothingness, through that stage which of livid ugliness which distinguishes the commercial dyes as nuisances, even more than their short and by no means merry life.""As to colours for carpets, he wrote in his essay on textiles; ""The soft gradations of tint to which Tapestry lends itself are unfit for Carpet-weaving; beauty and variety of colour must be obtained bh harmonious juxtaposition of tints, bounded by judiciously chosen outlines, and the pattern should lie absolutely flat on the ground. On the whole, in designing carpets the method of contrast should is the best one to employ, and blue and red, quit frankly used, with white or very light outlines on a dark ground, and black or some very dark colour on a light ground, are the main colours on which the designer should depend.""

			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


== Legacy ==
William Morris died on October 3, 1896, but the Morris & Co. continued to design and produce textiles he had designed or planned, under the supervision of his chief assistant and Art Director John Henry Dearle. Dearle managed the company's textile works at Merton Abbey until his own death in 1932. The firm was finally dissolved in 1940, but his designs continue to be produced and marketed by other textile firms, including Sanderson and Sons, part of the Walker Greenbank wallpaper and fabrics business, which now owns the. ""Morris and Co."" brand name, and by the department store Liberty of London.

Charlotte Tardieu,"Marie Charlotte Elisabeth d'Arpentigny de Malleville Tardieu (9 September 1829 – May 1890) was a French composer, concert pianist, and teacher who organized chamber recitals throughout Europe. She composed and performed under the names Charlotte de Malleville or Charlotte Tardieu.


== Early life and career ==
Tardieu was born in Roncherolles (today Roncherolles sur le Vivier). She studied music in Rouen with Jean-Amédée le Froid de Méreaux. On March 1, 1853, she married Amédée Eugène Tardieu. They had two sons, André and Jacques, and settled in Paris. André's son, also named André Tardieu, would become the prime minister of France in 1929.Tardieu presented piano recitals throughout Europe, and performed as the soloist in piano concerti by Mozart and Beethoven.

Well-known for her interpretation of Mozart, Tardieu specialized in older music and rarely performing music by contemporary composers other than herself. In 1864, she formed a trio with cellist Alfredo Piatti and violinist Camille Sivori. Georges Onslow dedicated his Septet for Piano and Wind Instruments, Op. 79 to her.From 1849 to 1869, Tardieu organized four chamber concerts a year in the Pleyel and Erard concert halls in Paris, and the Sax concert hall in the Egmont Palace in Belgium. She formed at least one class to study classical piano repertoire with performers Casimir, Dorus, Gouffe, Lebouc, Maurin, and Ney.Tardieu's music was published by Henry Lemoine. Her compositions, all for piano, included:

Berceuse, opus 7
Carillon, opus 6

Musée d'Art Dentaire Pierre Fauchard,"The Musée d'Art Dentaire Pierre Fauchard is a museum of dental history located in the 16th arrondissement at the Académie Nationale de Chirurgie Dentaire, 22 Rue Émile Ménier, Paris, France. It is open Wednesday afternoons by appointment. The nearest métro and RER stations are Porte Dauphine, Avenue Foch, and Victor Hugo.
The museum dates to 1879, when Parisian dentists began to organize a dental school; with it the Musée d'Art Dentaire was established to display old techniques and tools. By 1892, its collection contained around 300 items. In 1937, the museum was renamed the Musée Pierre Fauchard to honor Pierre Fauchard (1678–1761), sometimes called the father of modern dentistry. Since 2003, its collections have been maintained by the Musée de l'Assistance Publique – Hôpitaux de Paris.Today the museum contains over 1,000 items relating to the history of dentistry, including instruments and dental chairs from the seventeenth century to nineteenth century, about 350 items for the cleaning and extraction of teeth, about 200 dental prosthetics, as well as etchings, paintings from the seventeenth century Dutch School, and a library of about 500 antique books including an original edition of Fauchard's ""Le Chirurgien Dentiste"", published 1728. One item of particular note is the magnificent Charles X case, manufactured in the United States in the middle of the 19th century, which contains a total of 130 instruments for the maintenance and extraction of teeth.

"Gálvez, Santa Fe","Gálvez is a city in the center of the province of Santa Fe, Argentina, 81 km (50 mi) south of the provincial capital Santa Fe. It has 18,374 inhabitants per the 2001 census [INDEC].
The original settlement was an agricultural colony called Colonia Margarita, in lands belonging to José Gálvez, then governor of the province, who rented it for farming, mainly to Italian immigrants from Piamonte and Lombardia. The official foundation date, 15 October 1886, is that of the opening of the train station, as is usual in many other towns founded in this period in Santa Fe. The communal institutions were formally created on 12 January 1887, and the town became a full municipality on 19 March 1939. The name of governor Gálvez replaced the original one by a decree of 6 June 1889.
The area of Gálvez has a good precipitation regime and produces diverse crops (wheat, corn, soybean, sorghum, sunflower). Cattle are mostly employed for its milk (the central region of Santa Fe is the most important milk-producing area in Argentina). Local industries include the manufacturing of electric engines and transformers, machine tools, furniture, and dairy products.

On 28 February 2011, the Greek Government enacted Law 3920/2011, which allowed the Attiko Metro Operation Company (AMEL) to merge with the Athens–Piraeus Electric Railways (ISAP) and Tram S.A. to form Urban Rail Transport S.A., or STASY as it is commonly known. The merged company, which came into effect on 17 June 2011 under Ministerial Decree 28737/2637, became a subsidiary of Transport for Athens (OASA). ISAP's headquarters at 67 Athinas Street, near Omonoia Square, became the headquarters of STASY.Three different companies used to operate and maintain the Athens Metro and Athens Tram network before the creation of STASY:

Line 1 of the Metro used to be operated by the Athens–Piraeus Electric Railways (Greek: Ηλεκτρικοί Σιδηρόδρομοι Αθηνών Πειραιώς; ISAP): ISAP was created as a public company on 1 January 1976, to replace the privately-owned Hellenic Electric Railways Company (EIS). ISAP came under the authority of OASA in 1998.
Lines 2 and 3 of the Metro used to be operated by the Attiko Metro Operation Company (Greek: Αττικό Μετρό Εταιρεία Λειτουργίας; AMEL): AMEL was created on 15 February 2001, as an operational subsidiary of public transport developer and constructor Attiko Metro (now Elliniko Metro), instead of OASA.
The Athens Tram used to be operated by Tram S.A. (Greek: ΤΡΑΜ Α.Ε.). Founded in March 2001, Tram S.A. was also a subsidiary of Attiko Metro, instead of OASA.


== Operations ==
STASY is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the Athens Metro and the Athens Tram, including the infrastructure, rolling stock, 59 tram stops and 62 of the 66 metro stations. GAIAOSE owns and maintains the surface section of Line 3 between Doukissis Plakentias and Athens Airport, and the operator of the Athens International Airport manages the Airport station.

It is the turn from the nineteenth to the twentieth century. Countess Thun asked the famous New York detective Nick Carter to travel to Prague, for assistance to solve the strange case of a missing dog. Carter is assisted by Prague police commissar Ledvina. Mysterious murder cases happen during the investigations, done by the malicious botanist Baron von Kratzmar and his carnivorous plant Adela. 
Von Kratzmar kidnapped his victims, bound them and whenever he played a gramophone with the melody ""Schlafe, mein Prinzchen"" (a lullaby by Bernhard Flies but previously associated with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) it is the time for Adela to awaken and eat her victims for dinner. 
Baron von Kratzmar considered himself a misjudged genius and wanted to take revenge on one of his former professors. He called himself ""the Gardener"" a notorious criminal, who Nick Carter thought had died in the swamps years ago. With the help of bizarre inventions, Ledvina and Carter succeed in catching von Kratzmar and delivering him to the legal authorities.

Kara Edwards,"Kara Edwards (born February 17, 1977) is an American voice actress working for the English versions of Japanese anime. She is also well known in the Charlotte, North Carolina area for her past career as a radio host.


== Career ==
Edwards began her broadcast career with a job at Radio Disney out of Dallas, Texas the fall after she graduated from high school. She interned for eight months before landing the more permanent jobs of writer, producer, voice actress and children's voice director.
In July 1997, she became co-host of the Squeege and Kara Show on syndicated Radio Disney with friend and fellow voice actor Kyle Hebert.She did voice-over work in commercials for companies such as Blockbuster, Levi Strauss & Co. and Clinique. During the latter part of her Radio Disney tenure, Edwards voiced in a number of English-language versions of Japanese anime series for Funimation. Her most notable voice role as the child version of Goten and Videl in Dragon Ball Z. In March 2002, Edwards was hired as a producer and occasional ""sidekick"" for the Sander Walker in the Morning radio show on WSSS 104.7 FM in Charlotte, North Carolina.
She stayed in this position until October 31, 2003. After that morning's airing finished, the entire Sander Walker show cast and crew were informed that WSSS was switching its format to Christmas music around the clock and subsequently were all terminated. Edwards was not off the airwaves for long, however. In February 2004, she became the co-host of the Jeff Roper Morning Show syndicated from WSOC 103.7 FM, also out of Charlotte.
In January 2005, Jeff Roper left WSOC to take a morning job at WWNU 92 FM in Columbia, South Carolina.  WSOC management assigned Edwards to take up co-hosting duties with Rob Tanner as part of the new Tanner in the Morning show. The show's mix of regional humor and parodies made it one of the higher-rated morning shows in the Charlotte area's country music radio market and Edwards continued her co-hosting duties for nearly two years.
Although Edwards enjoyed her radio work, she began to feel strongly about voice acting.  In August 2006, Edwards and fellow voice actors Sean Schemmel, Christopher Sabat, and Jason Liebrecht attended the Wizard World Comics Convention in Chicago, Illinois. When Dragon Ball fans waited in line up to five hours to get her autograph, Edwards began seriously considering making voice acting her full-time job.

""I decided then, you know what? This is my passion in life. I always thought radio was the place I should be and pursued it and pursued it. Now I think this is the place I should be.""
A few weeks later, Edwards brought her feelings to WSOC management during a monthly performance strategy meeting and told them of her desire to go into voice acting full-time and leave her position as co-host. WSOC and the Tanner show staff accepted Edwards's decision and her departure was handled amicably.
Since then, Edwards has resided in Dallas doing commercial and documentary voice-over, but occasionally returns to Funimation to reprise her Dragon Ball roles and other anime.


== Personal life ==
Edwards met Charlotte CBS affiliate WBTV meteorologist Chris Suchan; they married in April 2006.  They were later divorced. She gave birth to a child in August 2015.
In 2019, Edwards alleged that voice actor Vic Mignogna had sexually harassed her, citing that he had propositioned her in 2008 and 2010 without her consent. She initially revealed the allegations anonymously through io9 but later testified against him during his lawsuit.In November 2020, Edwards married voice actor Zach Bolton.

It is intended to greatly increase user comfort through the use of lightweight, moisture-wicking, and breathable fabrics. The ACS was created in conjunction with the USMC's Flame Resistant Organizational Gear (FROG). The ACS, in conjunction with the Fire Resistant ACU (FRACU) trousers, provides head-to-toe protection against burns.


== Background ==
Traditionally, flame-resistant uniforms have been reserved for military personnel such as aviators, fuel handlers and combat vehicle crew who were most likely to encounter fuel-related fires. However, the increasing frequency of improvised explosive devices in Afghanistan and Iraq during the 2000s greatly increased the number of troops in need of flame-resistant clothing and uniforms.


== History ==


=== 2000s ===


==== 2007: Introduction ====
In January 2007, the Army began shipping 160,000 flame-resistant Nomex uniforms for soldiers assigned to at-risk convoy operations. However, the Nomex uniforms restricted air movement more than the traditional Cotton/Nylon ACU and were hotter for soldiers to wear. Army equipment officials developed the ACS to provide soldiers with a lightweight, breathable alternative to the Nomex ACU.


=== 2010s ===


==== 2016–2019: Ballistic Combat Shirt ====
Currently the U.S. Army is working on an armored variant of the Army Combat Shirt known as the ""Ballistic Combat Shirt"", which adds ballistic protection to the upper thorax, lower neck, and upper sleeve areas while sacrificing as little arm mobility as possible. This has been desirable due to the increasing prevalence of low-profile body armor which does not support the additional extremity protection the IBA system does, as well as ergonomic issues with the extremity protection that causes soldiers to choose not to use them even when wearing compatible armor. It will begin fielding in 2019.


== Overview ==
Initially, the torso of the shirt was foliage green with the Army Strong logo centered on the chest (removed in later versions); the arms are in the Universal Camouflage Pattern similar to the Army Combat Uniform, with integrated anti-abrasion elbow pads. No-seam shoulders minimize rubbing or chafing against armor. With the adoption of the MultiCam uniform for wear in Afghanistan, there is now a version made with a coyote brown body (Tan 498) and MultiCam sleeves.  When the US Army adopted the Operational Camouflage Pattern starting in 2015, a third variant became available which complies to the US Army uniform regulations code AR 670-1 (Wear and Appearance of Army Uniform and Insignia) with a tan/green body (Tan 499) and sleeves in the OCP pattern. Other features include a double pen pocket on the lower arm, zippered storage pockets on the upper arm, concealable infrared identification tabs, and a place to attach name, rank, and flag on the upper arm. There are two styles of the ACS available for soldiers.  The Type I has a mock turtle neck and the Type II has a Mandarin style collar with a 3/4 zipper on the chest/neck.  The features of all three shirts, besides the collar differences from the two types, are all the same.
The ACS is constructed of three flame-resistant performance fabrics proprietary to TenCate Protective Fabrics or Massif Mountain Gear Company. The shirt’s torso is constructed of two highly breathable flame-resistant fabrics with advanced moisture management capabilities. Both fabrics wick moisture away from the skin and dry rapidly, preventing the fabrics from sticking to the user’s skin and greatly increasing comfort under body armor. The sleeves and side panels of the shirt are constructed of a lightweight, but durable and abrasion-resistant fabric designed to provide extra protection for areas not protected by body armor. All three fabrics feature 4-way stretch for enhanced performance and user comfort.

1969 Michigan Wolverines football team,"The 1969 Michigan Wolverines football team was an American football team that represented the University of Michigan in the 1969 Big Ten Conference football season. In their first year under head coach Bo Schembechler, the Wolverines compiled an 8–3 record (6–1 Big Ten), played in the 1970 Rose Bowl, and finished the season ranked No. 9 in the final AP poll and No. 8 in the final UPI poll.
The 1969 Michigan vs. Ohio State football game was considered one of the biggest upsets in college football history, as Ohio State came into the game with a 22-game winning streak and the No. 1 ranking in the polls. Michigan intercepted six Ohio State passes and defeated the Buckeyes, 24–12, in front of a crowd of 103,588 at Michigan Stadium to win the Big Ten Conference's berth in the 1970 Rose Bowl.  The game was also the first in a series that came to be known as ""The Ten Year War"".
Bo Schembechler suffered a heart attack the night before the 1970 Rose Bowl game against an undefeated (but once tied) USC team.  The Wolverines lost the Rose Bowl in a defensive struggle by a score of 10–3.
Team captain and tight end Jim Mandich was selected as the team's most valuable player and as a first-team All-American.  Defensive back Tom Curtis was also selected as a first-team All-American.  Six members of the team received first-team honors on the 1969 All-Big Ten Conference football team: Mandich at tight end; Curtis at defensive back; Dan Dierdorf at tackle; Guy Murdock at center; Billy Taylor at running back; and Marty Huff at linebacker.  Thirteen members of the 1969 team went on to play professional football, and four players (Mandich, Curtis, Dierdorf and offensive guard Reggie McKenzie) were inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.


== Schedule ==


== Season summary ==


=== Preseason ===
The 1968 Michigan team compiled an 8–2 record (6–1 Big Ten), finished second in the Big Ten, and was ranked No. 12 in the final AP Poll. The season ended with a humiliating 50–14 loss to Ohio State on November 23, 1968. On December 25, the Detroit Free Press reported that Michigan was searching for a new head coach and that Bump Elliott's resignation was imminent. The following day, Michigan athletic director Don Canham hired Bo Schembechler, the 39-year-old head coach at Miami of Ohio, to take over as the Wolverines' head coach. Schembechler had played football at Miami under Woody Hayes and compiled a 40-16-3 record in six seasons as Miami's head coach.Schembechler brought the core of his coaching staff with him from Miami, including Jim Young, Gary Moeller, Larry Smith, Jerry Hanlon, Chuck Stobart, and Dick Hunter. Schembechler also retained three assistants from Bump Elliott's coaching staff: George Mans, Frank Maloney, and Bob Shaw.One of the principal challenges facing the new coaching staff was finding a replacement for 1968 All-American running back Ron Johnson.  The leading candidates were Glenn Doughty and Billy Taylor, two sophomores with zero minutes of game experience at the college level.Another change in 1969 was the removal of Michigan Stadium's natural grass and the installation of 3M's ""Tartan Turf"" playing surface, purchased at a cost of a quarter of a million dollars.Veterans from the 1968 team who returned in 1969 included end Jim Mandich, defensive back Tom Curtis, offensive tackle Dan Dierdorf, middle guard Henry Hill, and fullback Garvie Craw.On September 4, 1969, coach Schembechler announced that Jim Mandich had been elected team captain. Mandich called it ""the greatest honor of my life.""


=== Vanderbilt ===
On September 20, 1969, Michigan played its first game under new head coach Bo Schembechler. The Wolverines defeated Vanderbilt, 42–14, at Michigan Stadium.  Garvie Craw capped a 71-yard drive with a one-yard touchdown run in the first quarter, and Glenn Doughty ran 80 yards for a touchdown in the second quarter. Michigan led, 14-0, at halftime. In the fourth quarter, Mike Keller blocked a Vanderbilt punt, and Marty Huff returned the ball 31 yards for a touchdown. On the next Vanderbilt drive, Tom Curtis intercepted a pass and returned it 45 yards to set up quarterback Don Moorhead's second rushing touchdown. Michigan led, 14-7, at the end of the third quarter, then scored 28 points in the fourth. On defense, Michigan held Vanderbilt to 55 rushing yards.Michigan rushed for 367 yards (209 in the first half) and passed for only 42. Doughty led the way with 138 rushing yards on 15 carries, and Moorhead added 103 yards on 11 carries. Jim Mandich caught two passes to move into second place on Michigan's all-time receptions list with 71.In his first post-game press conference, Schembechler noted: ""We're not a fancy ball club. Secondly, when you can punch the football down their throats, that's what you should do."" Quarterback Don Moorhead added: ""That's Bo's offense -- just basic stuff. We stick it to 'em. It's what he calls grinding meat.""After the game, a crowd of 12,000 participated in a post-game, anti-war rally on The Diag.  David Dellinger, one of the Chicago Eight, was the main speaker at the rally.


=== Washington ===
On September 27, 1969, Michigan defeated Washington, 45–7, before a Michigan Stadium crowd of 49,684—the lowest attendance for a Michigan home game since 1963. In the first quarter, Jim Mandich scored on a six-yard pass from Don Moorhead, but the kick for extra point failed. Moorhead scored on a five-yard run off a broken play in the second quarter, and Moorhead's run for two-point conversion failed.  Michigan led, 12-0, at halftime. Moorhead ran for two additional touchdowns in the third quarter, and runs for two-point conversions failed each time. Michigan added three touchdowns in the fourth quarter, including a 59-yard pass from Jim Betts to Bill Harris.Michigan totaled 581 yards of total offense (362 rushing, 219 passing), breaking a Michigan single-game record of 531 yards set in 1943. Glenn Doughty and Moorhead led the team on offense. Doughty rushed for 191 yards on 29 carries.  Moorhead rushed for 128 yards and completed 14 of 19 passes for 160 yards. After the game, Schembechler explained his increased reliance on the passing game: ""Washington is a very tough inside team. We felt we had to go wide and throw the football."" On defense, Tom Curtis and Barry Pierson intercepted two passes each.


=== Missouri ===
On October 4, 1969, Michigan, ranked No. 11 in the Coaches Poll, lost to Dan Devine's No. 9 Missouri Tigers by a 40–17 score before a crowd of 64,476 at Michigan Stadium. On offense, Michigan was limited to 82 rushing yards and 99 passing yards. Starting running back Glenn Doughty had 72 rushing yards on 22 carries but suffered an ankle injury. Quarterback Don Moorhead totaled minus 22 rushing yards. The Wolverines were also stymied by mistakes, as they turned the ball over five times on four fumbles and an interception. They also had a punt blocked, gave up seven quarterback sacks, and were penalized 11 times for 78 yards. After the game, coach Schembechler said: ""You can't turn the ball over time and again, time and again, and win football games. That was the worst performance by one of my teams in years -- and I haven't had a punt blocked in six years. . . . I didn't know what one looked like.""


=== Purdue ===
On October 11, 1969, Michigan, unranked after its loss to Missouri, upset previously unbeaten No. 9 Purdue, 31–20, before a crowd of 80,411 at Michigan Stadium.  Michigan had previously lost five games in a row against the Boilermakers dating back to 1962.On offense, Michigan struggled on the ground, gaining a season low 123 net rushing yards (50 by Billy Taylor, 41 by Glenn Doughty). Doughty re-injured his right ankle in the third quarter, opening the door for Billy Taylor to take over as Michigan's No 1 running back in the second half of the season. Quarterback Don Moorhead picked up the slack, completing 15 of 25 passes for 247 yards. Tight end Jim Mandich caught 10 of Moorhead's passes for 156 yards and a touchdown.Purdue outgained Michigan by a total of 416 yards to 370. Purdue quarterback Mike Phipps came into the game as the national leader in total offense and a leading candidate for the Heisman Trophy. He rushed for a touchdown and completed 22 of 44 passes for 250 yards and two touchdowns. Purdue fullback John Bullock also stood out with 84 rushing yards and 81 receiving yards. However, Michigan's defense intercepted four of Phipps' passes (three by Marty Huff, one by Tom Curtis) and recovered three Purdue fumbles (one of the fumbles by Phipps).The game also featured Bo Schembechler's first major run-in with Big Ten Conference officials.  When Michigan's middle guard Henry Hill assisted an injured teammate (Cecil Pryor) off the field, an official thought Hill was being illegally substituted into the game and threw a flag. Schembechler rushed onto the field to confront the official and was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct. The dual penalties gave Purdue the ball at Michigan's one-yard line, setting up the first Purdue touchdown.


=== Michigan State ===
On October 18, 1969, Michigan lost to Duffy Daugherty's Michigan State Spartans by a 23–12 score in front of a crowd of 79,368 in East Lansing. Led by halfback Don Highsmith (134 rushing yards and two touchdowns on a Big Ten record 30 carries) and quarterback Bill Triplett (143 rushing yards and a touchdown on 18 carries), the Spartans outgained the Wolverines on the ground by totals of 348 yards to 176. On being told after the game that his team had allowed 348 rushing yards, coach Schembechler replied: ""That's terrible . . you can't win a football game that way, not unless you're scoring 30 or 40 points.""Forced to throw after Michigan State took a 23–3 lead, Michigan quarterback Don Moorhead completed 13 of 35 passes for 164 yards.  Tight end Jim Mandich caught nine of Moorhead's passes for 118 yards. Glenn Doughty rushed for 89 yards and a touchdown on 26 carries, but he also fumbled for an 11-yard loss, missed a block leading to a quarterback sack, and was tagged with a safety after he caught a kickoff at the one-yard line, stepped back into the end zone, and downed the ball for what he thought was a touchback. In the fourth quarter, Spartan punter Pat Miller took an intentional safety rather than punting from the end zone.


=== Minnesota ===
On October 25, 1969, Michigan defeated Minnesota, 35–9, in the annual Little Brown Jug game, played before a crowd of 44,028 in Minneapolis. Michigan's offense sputtered in the first half, as Ted Killian missed two field goal attempts, and the Wolverines trailed, 9–7, at halftime.
The Wolverines rebounded in the second half, scoring 28 unanswered points. With Glenn Doughty sidelined due to ankle and thigh injuries, Billy Taylor started his first game as Michigan's tailback. Taylor totaled 151 rushing yards on 31 carries and scored Michigan's first three touchdowns. Quarterback Don Moorhead had 61 rushing yards and a touchdown and completed eight of 12 passes for 92 yards. Michigan totaled 285 rushing yards and 103 passing yards. On defense, the Wolverines limited the Gophers to 75 rushing yards, 182 passing yards, and three field goals, and intercepted two Minnesota passes. Middle guard Henry Hill led the defense with eight solo tackles and three assists.After the game, coach Schembechler called the game ""our greatest win of the year.""


=== Wisconsin ===
On November 1, 1969, Michigan defeated Wisconsin, 35–7, in the rain before a homecoming crowd of 60,438 at Michigan Stadium. Michigan scored all of its 35 points in the first half.  Billy Taylor, playing in place of the injured Glenn Doughty, rushed for 142 yards, including touchdown runs of 37 and 51 yards in the first quarter. In the second quarter, Barry Pierson added a 51-yard punt return, Tom Curtis intercepted a pass at Michigan's eight-yard line and returned it 27 yards, and Jim Mandich scored on a 12-yard pass from Don Moorhead.


=== Illinois ===
On November 8, 1969, Michigan defeated Illinois, 57–0, before a crowd of 35,270 at Memorial Stadium in Champaign, Illinois. The Michigan Daily reported that the 57-point margin ""the worst drubbing either school has received in this long and fabled rivalry that dates to 1898."" Michigan totaled 524 yards of total offense (328 rushing and 196 passing).After a scoreless first quarter, Michigan's Tim Killian kicked a 28-yard field goal in the second quarter. Tailback Billy Taylor then scored on an 84-yard touchdown run. Taylor totaled 155 yards on 13 carries, all in the first half. Fullback Garvie Craw scored four touchdowns, two in the second quarter and one each in the third and fourth quarters. After the game, coach Schembechler said: ""Garvie Craw is a strong runner. His average per carry is very low, but he always has the tough yardage to get.""Backup quarterback Jim Betts was responsible for three fourth-quarter touchdowns, on passes to Craw and John Gabler and the other on a quarterback sneak. Betts tallied 157 yards of total offense (106 passing yards and 51 rushing yards). Defensive back Bruce Elliott, the son of former Illinois coach Pete Elliott and a graduate of Champaign Central High School, concluded the scoring on a 40-yard interception return for a touchdown with 39 seconds remaining in the game.Despite the impressive win, coach Schembechler was characteristically guarded in his post-game press conference: ""We didn't play well. The defense was not sharp in the first half and neither was the offense.""


=== Iowa ===
On November 15, 1969, Michigan defeated Iowa, 51–6, in Iowa City. Michigan set three Big Ten Conference single-game records with 524 rushing yards, 673 yards of total offense, and 34 first downs.  Running back Billy Taylor led the attack with 225 rushing yards and two touchdowns on 21 carries, all in the first three quarters. Adding to the attack were Glenn Doughty (100 rushing yards), Don Moorhead (90 passing yards, 80 rushing yards), Bill Harris (80 receiving yards), Garvie Craw (51 rushing yards), and Jim Betts (50 rushing yards). Iowa's only touchdown was scored with 22 seconds remaining in the game.Asked after the game whether Michigan could beat Ohio State, Iowa coach Ray Nagel replied: ""They can beat anybody in the country.""


=== Ohio State ===

On November 22, 1969, Michigan, ranked No. 12 in the AP Poll, upset Woody Hayes' Ohio State Buckeyes, 24–12, before a crowd of 103,588 at Michigan Stadium. Ohio State entered the game ranked No. 1, riding a 22-game winning streak, and favored by 17 points. Ohio State running back Jim Otis rushed for 144 yards and a touchdown on 28 carries, but quarterback Rex Kern completed only six passes for 88 yards, and Michigan intercepted six Ohio State passes. Michigan defensive back Tom Curtis intercepted two passes and set an NCAA career record with 431 interception return yards.

Fullback Garvie Craw scored two touchdowns, and tight end Jim Mandich caught six passes for 78 yards. Neither team scored in the second half.


=== 1970 Rose Bowl game ===

On January 1, 1970, Michigan, ranked No. 7 in the AP Poll, lost to John McKay's undefeated No. 5 USC Trojans, 10–3, before a crowd of 103,878 in the 1970 Rose Bowl game in Pasadena, California. Michigan coach Bo Schembechler was hospitalized with a heart attack four hours before the game began.  Defensive coordinator Jim Young served as the acting head coach.The teams traded field goals in the first half, and USC took the lead with three minutes remaining in the third quarter on a 33-yard touchdown pass from Jimmy Jones to Bobby Chandler. USC's ""Wild Bunch"" defense held Michigan 162 rushing yards and 127 passing yards.In the fourth quarter, Michigan quarterback Don Moorhead led three drives into USC territory. On the first drive, Michigan took the ball to USC's 13-yard line, but Moorhead's pass on fourth down slipped through Garvie Craw's hands. On the next drive, Michigan drove to USC's nine-yard line where Craw was stopped on a fourth-and-one run. On the final drive, Moorhead threw 12 passes and converted twice on fourth down before time expired. The loss was Michigan's first in five Rose Bowl games.


=== Award season ===
In January 1970, the American Football Coaches Association selected Bo Schembechler as the Major College Coach of the Year. Schembechler was still in the hospital at the time of the award ceremony and quipped: ""I may well be the only coach to win this award who failed to show up for his final game."" Schembechler returned to Ann Arbor on January 19 following his discharge from the hospital.Two Michigan players received first-team honors on the 1969 All-America team:

1969 Football Team – Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan Athletics History","The 1969 Michigan Wolverines football team was an American football team that represented the University of Michigan in the 1969 Big Ten Conference football season. In their first year under head coach Bo Schembechler, the Wolverines compiled an 8–3 record (6–1 Big Ten), played in the 1970 Rose Bowl, and finished the season ranked No. 9 in the final AP poll and No. 8 in the final UPI poll.

Yaqub Ibn as-Sikkit,"Abū Yūsuf Ya‘qūb Ibn as-Sikkīt (ابو يوسف يعقوب ابن السكيت) was a persian philologist tutor to the son of the Abbasid caliph Al-Mutawakkil and a great grammarian and scholar of poetry of the al-Kūfah school.  He was punished on the orders of the caliph and died between 857 and 861.


== Life ==
He was the son of al-Sikkīt, a philologist of the Kūfī school of grammar, a man of science, and an associate of the scholars al-Kisā’ī and al-Farrā’. Where the father excelled in poetry and linguistics, the son excelled in grammar. His father originated from the village of Dawraq, Ahwaz Khuzestan (Iran),Ya‘qūb was a scholar of Baghdād, which followed the Kūfī school tradition in grammar, Qur’anic science and poetry. He studied and recorded the pure Arabic language from the Desert Arabs.  He tutored the sons of al-Mutawakkil, who were Al-Muntasir and Al-Mu'tazz.
Ya‘qūb’s surname was Abū Yūsuf and his son, Yūsuf, was a court companion and personally close to the caliph al-Mu‘taḍid.He was a disciple of Abū ‘Amr al-Shaybānī, Muḥammad ibn Muhanna, and Muḥammad ibn Subh ibn as-Sammāq. He taught the philology of al-Asmaʿi, Abū Ubaidah, and al-Farrā’.Isḥāq al-Nadīm records that he was a pupil of Naṣrān al-Khurāsāni.  Naṣrān had transmitted the poetry of al-Kumayt with ‘Umar ibn Bukayr and Ibn al-Sikkīt, who had memorised Naṣrān's books had a bitter disagreement about Naṣrān‘s teachings with the Kūfī scholar, al-Ṭūsī. The account of al-Sikkīt, related by al-Nadim through the classical isnād source-system, cites the narrator-chain of Abū Sa‘īd,  Abū Bakr ibn Durayd and al-Riyāshī, in an account illustrative of the active intellectual exchange between the two rival schools of Baṣrah and Kūfah in the 9th century.  A group of wārraqūn of al-Kūfah gathered for a reading aloud by a warrāq of al-Baṣrah, of Ibn al-Sikkīt’s Book of Logic. Al-Riyāshī was at the event and attested that Ibn al-Sikkīt had told him, that he had learned the vernacular dialects of Southern ‘Irāq from Ḥarashat al-Ḍibāb and Aklat al-Yarābī, and they had derived theirs from the people of al-Sawād. He mentions examples of words such as “akalah al-kuwāmīkh” and “al-shawārīz.""The tests of rivalry between schools is illustrated in another account given by al-Nadim, told as a kind of cautionary tale. When al-Athram, a young scholar from al-Baṣrah, challenges Ya‘qūb ibn al-Sikkīt, a senior scholar of al-Kūfah school, on a verse by the poet al-Rā’ī, he clearly breaks the etiquette code that always ranks seniority above juniority.

Rex Garvin,"Rex Garvin (July 24, 1940 – December 2, 2013) was an American rhythm and blues singer, songwriter, keyboard player and arranger. His writing credits include the 1957 US chart hit ""Over the Mountain; Across the Sea"", by Johnnie and Joe, and his own 1966 recording ""Sock It To 'Em J.B."", later recorded by The Specials.


== Life and career ==
Garvin was born in Harlem and raised by foster parents in the Bronx. He took piano lessons as a child. In 1954, he helped form The Hearts, a female vocal group with whom he sang bass, played piano and wrote and arranged songs. Managed by neighbor Zelma ""Zell"" Sanders, The Hearts' first record ""Lonely Nights"" was issued on the Baton label in early 1955 and reached No. 8 on the Billboard R&B chart. He remained involved with the group as their pianist, arranger, musical director and (in their own word) ""maestro"" through various personnel changes during the 1950s, later explaining that he did so ""mainly to meet girls"". Members of The Hearts later performed as The Jaynetts.
At the same time, Garvin became Sanders' main assistant at J&S Records, which she set up in 1956, and he was responsible for the label's typical full, bottom-heavy piano-laden arrangements. The label's greatest successes came with the duo Johnnie and Joe, whose biggest hit ""Over the Mountain, Across the Sea"" (#8 Pop and No. 3 R&B in 1957) was written by Garvin, who sang harmony vocals on the song and was credited as bandleader. The duo comprised Garvin's friend Joe Rivers, and Sanders' daughter Johnnie. The song was covered in 1963 by Bobby Vinton, whose version reached No. 21 on the Hot 100.Garvin's own recording career started in 1957, with ""My Darling Dear"". In 1959, his vocal duet with Marie Knight as Marie and Rex on ""I Can't Sit Down"" reached No. 94 on the Billboard pop chart. He formed his own group Rex Garvin and the Mighty Cravers in 1961, releasing their first single ""Go Little Willie""/""Emulsified"", on Epic Records; the single was reissued two years later by Okeh. The group toured widely on the ""Chitlin' Circuit"".Although Garvin had little commercial success, he released a string of records through the 1960s in a variety of styles, including ""Oh Yeah!"" (on the Scatt label, an offshoot of J&S, 1962), ""Soul Food"" (on Keynote, 1963), ""Sock It To 'Em J.B."" (originally on the Like label, 1966), ""I Gotta Go Now (Up on the Floor)"" (Like, 1967), and ""You Don't Need No Help (You Can Sock It to Yourself)"" (WSJ Sound, 1969). Several of these recordings have been anthologized in recent years, particularly on Northern Soul compilations. ""Sock It to 'Em J.B."" had a double meaning, being a tribute to James Bond performed in the style of James Brown; it was issued as a single in the UK as well as the U.S., and later was covered by British band The Specials on their album More Specials in 1980 (a cover which lent the song a potential triple meaning, as it was also a form of homage to drummer John Bradbury). Rex Garvin and the Mighty Cravers – comprising saxophonist Clayton Dunn and drummer Pete Holman, together with Garvin on keyboards – also released an album, Raw Funky Earth on the Tower label in 1968. Their last record release was ""Strange Happenings"" on the Chieftain label in 1971.He left the Mighty Cravers and quit the music business in about 1975. He moved to Atlanta, Georgia, but continued to play occasional gigs until 1985. In 1990, ""Emulsified"" was covered by Yo La Tengo on their album Fakebook. Garvin died in Atlanta in 2013, aged 73.

Frank Parlato Jr.,"Frank Parlato Jr. (born April 25, 1955) is an American publisher. He publishes the Frank Report, Artvoice and the Niagara Falls Reporter. Parlato is widely credited for bringing attention to the NXIVM cult when he published the article ""Branded Slaves and Master Raniere"" on June 5, 2017.


== NXIVM Relationship and Federal Case ==
In 2007, Parlato was hired to work for NXIVM as a publicist. He was fired the following year, and went on to blog about NXIVM on his own website, the Frank Report. In 2019 he received wide media coverage for his efforts to bring down the NXIVM cult.In 2015 Parlato was federally indicted on 19 counts, including fraud, money laundering and conspiracy related to his management of the One Niagara Center in Niagara Falls, New York. In 2018, prosecutors dropped the portion of the charges against him that related to defrauding Seagram's heirs.The Buffalo News, noting the changes in the US DOJ WDNY superseding indictment, reported that Seagram's heir Clare Bronfman went from the accuser in Parlato's case to the accused when she was arrested in 2018, noting also that Parlato broke major stories that led to her arrest.Parlato and the US Government reached a plea deal on August 5, 2022.  Frank Parlato pleaded guilty to a single count of failure to file an IRS form in 2010 for the receipt of more than $10,000 in cash. On July 31, 2023, Parlato plead guilty to one count of felony tax evasion was sentenced to five months of home detention.


== The Frank Report ==
The Frank Report began publishing blogs and stories on Nov. 30, 2015 – 10 days after Parlato was indicted. One of his first blogs on The Frank Report detailed Parlato's indictment, some of which were “fueled by Clare Bronfman & NXIVM’s legal team” after he left the cult. A common tactic NXIVM used was to go after defectors with an onslaught of civil & criminal charges, often smearing and bankrupting their targets which Frank was originally hired to be a part of.The Frank report has published thousands of articles about NXIVM, DOS, Keith Raniere, and other issues including cults, criminal justice, and legal journalism.


== NXIVM, DOS, and Cult Reporting ==
In 2019, Parlato was the lead investigator and consulting producer of the two-hour Investigation Discovery documentary The Lost Women of NXIVM.He appeared in five episodes of HBO's docuseries The Vow: ""Building Character"", ""Class 1 Data"", ""Blame & Responsibility"", ""The Wound"" and ""The Fall"". Parlato also appeared in episode four of Seduced: Inside the NXIVM Cult.In both docuseries, Parlato is credited with helping women who the cult called ""slaves"" escape and ending the practice of human branding within the cult subgroup called DOS.
In the Starz TV docuseries Seduced, Inside the NXIVM Cult, India Oxenberg credits Parlato for preventing ""slaves"" from being branded and required to have sex with NXIVM leader Keith Raniere. In the final episode of Seduced, ""Exposed"", Oxenberg said, ""As soon as the [Frank Report] posts started coming up, there were a ton of questions and a lot of chatter. My slaves left immediately after that. And none of them had to complete the seduction assignment or be branded. That was a huge relief.""Her mother, Catherine Oxenberg, who first revealed the existence of DOS to Parlato, confirmed that Parlato's stories prompted women to leave the group. In Seduced, she says that as a result of seeing Parlato's blog, ""A lot of DOS slaves started to defect.""Catherine Oxenberg told Gretchen Carlson, on the Lifetime special Beyond the Headlines: Escaping the NXIVM Cult about Parlato's work to expose the group that branded and blackmailed women and whose leaders were convicted of racketeering, sex trafficking, state law extortion, and sexual exploitation of a minor:Several former leaders of DOS blame Parlato for destroying their sorority and the NXIVM community, blaming him for writing ""distorted and highly-biased"" stories based on the ""skewed narrative"" of a few whistleblowers, including Sarah Edmondson. Parlato's stories ""effectively ended DOS. Everything ceased.""Actor Sam Rosenthal played Parlato in the A&E TV drama Escaping the NXIVM Cult: A Mother's Fight to Save Her Daughter in what was a fictionalized presentation based on the true story of Parlato's efforts to take down a vicious cult leader. 


== Other reporting ==
Prior to his investigative work on NXIVM, Parlato, through his publication the Niagara Falls Reporter, reported extensively on the no-bid contract that the Maid of the Mist Steamboat Company enjoyed while running boat cruises on the American and Canadian sides of the falls. He reported that the Niagara Parks Commission circumvented efforts by Ripley's Entertainment and Alcatraz Media from bidding on the boat tour concession while secretly approving a 25-year renewal of the Maid of the Mist Steamboat Company's license, while cutting its payment to the parks commission. In a series of articles, Parlato revealed that on the New York side, Maid of the Mist Steamboat Co. was operating rent free, and that the company tried to trademark the name 'Maid of the Mist' despite its use in tours and ferries since 1846.At one time, Parlato owned the One Niagra Building and took issue with having to pay taxes while the Seneca Nation, a sovereign tribe, did not. He accused Senecas of ""sucking the life out of Niagra Falls"". Parlato sold the building and moved on while the Seneca remained.The stories were ""hard-hitting and effected change"". The Ontario Parliament ordered the Maid of the Mist lease canceled and the boat tour put out to tender. The result was a winning bid by Hornblower Tours that was $300 million higher than the Maid would have paid had its lease not been canceled.Responding to critics who said he and his Niagara Falls Reporter publication had an unconventional style, Parlato told the Buffalo News, “We don’t follow anybody’s rules; we follow our own rules.”


== Federal prosecution ==
Following a four year investigation, Parlato and business partner Chitra Selvaraj were federally indicted in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York in November 2015. Charges included fraud, money laundering, and tax evasion relating to Parlato's ownership and management of the One Niagara Building (former headquarters of Occidental Petroleum).The matter was still in pretrial phase, with Parlato released on bond, when he was summoned by the federal court in Buffalo to appear November 2021 following an alleged incident in Florida with a girlfriend involving ""battery, false imprisonment, and witnessing tampering"". The event was investigated as a bail violation. The arrest warrant was rescinded, and the Court ordered Parlato undergo an anger management evaluation.Parlato accepted a plea agreement in August, 2022, pleading guilty to the willful failure to file an IRS Form 8300 (26 U.S.C. § 7203 and § 6050I) when he accepted a cash rent payment of $19,000 from commercial tenants of the One Niagara Building. The agreement also requires Parlato forfeit $1,000,000 originally seized during the investigation and to pay over $180,000 in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service. A sentencing date has been postponed several times, most recently to July 31
, 2023.

Legions of the Nile,"Legions of the Nile (Italian: Le legioni di Cleopatra, French: Les légions de Cléopâtre, Spanish: Las legiones de Cleopatra) is an Eastmancolor 1959 Italian-French-Spanish historical epic adventure film written and directed by Vittorio Cottafavi.


== Plot summary ==
A traveler from Greece to Alexandria seeks an audience with Cleopatra and employment as a gladiator at the time of the Roman conquest of Egypt.
Marcus Antonius, a renegade Roman who is in bondage to his mistress, also lives in the palace of Queen Cleopatra. Augustus wants to give him the opportunity to be reconciled with his country of origin. To this end, he instructs the warhorse Curridio to persuade Antonius to return to his homeland. When Curridio arrives in Alexandria, he poses as a Greek. As soon as he stops at the first tavern he comes across, he makes the acquaintance of the hard-drinking athlete Gotarze. The two are equally sympathetic and form friendships with each other.
Curridio acquires 12-year-old Rais and his older sister Marianne on the slave market. Although the girl is extremely attractive, her owner initially has no spare eyes for her. One night, Curridio sees the dancer Berenice, who immediately sets his heart on fire. He still has no idea that she is none other than the queen herself.
He only becomes aware of this when he has used a trick to overpower the palace guards and penetrated the sacred rooms. Because Cleopatra admires his daring, she now demands his love.
When Curridio gains access to the palace for the second time, he finds the renegade Antonius. But he rejects the offer of mediation and declares that he wants to fight Augustus. Curridio's fatality is that the conversation has been overheard. Now he is in great danger, but thanks to his friend Gotarze he is able to save himself at the last moment. However, little Rais paid for his courage with his life. Then Curridio learns how much he has been deceived by Cleopatra. Deeply hurt, he confronts her; but she has nothing but scorn for him and commands his death.
In the ensuing battle Augustus is victorious. After Cleopatra turned away from Antony, he committed suicide. The queen then drives eight horses to meet the victorious Caesar. But her art of seduction leaves him cold. Back in her palace, she too takes her own life.
Gotarze had managed to save Curridio a second time. He now bids farewell to his friends and returns to his homeland with Marianne, whom he has since learned to love.

Tangasseri,"Tangasseri or Thangassery (Thangi) is a heavily populated beach area on the shores of the Arabian Sea in Kollam city, Kerala, India.


== Location ==
Tangasseri is located about 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) from the city centre and 71 kilometres (44 mi) from Thiruvananthapuram, the state capital. Archaeologists recently discovered Chinese coins and other artefacts along the coast, which reveal the historic background of the location. Kollam Port makes Tangasseri an important place on the world maritime map.


== History ==
In 1502, the Portuguese were the first Europeans to establish a trading centre in Tangasseri and the area soon became a major centre for the pepper trade. Tangasseri's St Thomas Fort, built by the Portuguese in 1517, was destroyed in the subsequent wars with the Dutch.In 1661, the Dutch took possession of the city. The remains of both the Dutch and Portuguese forts can still be seen in Tangasseri. In the 18th century, the kingdom of Travancore first conquered Kollam, followed by the British in 1795. Tangasseri remains an Anglo-Indian settlement in character, though there are few Anglo-Indians in the population. Tangassery was a part of Malabar District during British Raj. The Infant Jesus Cathedral in Tangasseri an old Portuguese-built church, remains as a memento of Portuguese rule. The old cathedral was demolished and replaced by a new cathedral at a cost of around ₹4.5 crore (US$560,000); it was consecrated and blessed on 3 December 2005. The metallic cross on the top is one of the largest crosses in India.


== Importance ==
Tangasseri is a picturesque seaside village with a three kilometre long beach on which stands a 144 feet tall lighthouse—a silent sentinel warning seamen since 1902 of the treacherous reefs. There are also ruins of Portuguese and Dutch forts and 18th century churches. The fishery harbour at Tangasseri is a basin for traditional fishermen, achieved by the construction of two breakwaters. The length of the main breakwater is 2100 m and of the leeward breakwater 550 m. This provides sufficient beach length for landing facilities for all operational craft. Tangasseri is home to Kerala's oldest schools, Mount Carmel Convent Anglo-Indian Girls High School and Infant Jesus School Kollam.
The State Government of Kerala had submitted a proposal for constructing a sheltered lighterage Port at Thangassery by converting the Thangassery cove into an artificial harbour The Thangassery cove is about 45 miles to the South of theAshtamudi Lake inlet which was proposed to be developed as a Ashing harbour under the Norwegian-Indian  Fisheries Community Development Project Hie proposal to convert the Thangassery Cove into an artificial harbour involved the construction canal connecting the proposed port with Ashtamudi Lake.
In the meantime, another suggestion was made for developing Thangassery Cove as a fishing-cum-commercial port, if it was found impracticable to develop the Ashtamudi lake inlet. Model expenments in respect of both the scheme were carried out at the Poona Research Station.
The Government of Kerala was asked on the 7th January, 1959 to examine the reports submitted by the Poona Research Station and to work
out comparative costs of both the schemes m the light of the recommendations made m the Reports and forward their proposal to the Government along with a statement showing the comparative costs for the two schemes These are awaited A provision of Rs 42 5 lakhs has been proposed for development works at 
Thangassery in the Third Plan

La Salle Causeway,"The La Salle Causeway is a causeway that allows Highway 2 to cross the Cataraqui River (the southern entrance of the Rideau Canal) at Kingston, Ontario. The causeway separates Kingston's inner and outer harbours. Construction of the causeway was completed on April 15, 1917.Three bridges are incorporated into the causeway, the centre one being a Strauss trunnion bascule lift bridge, which was designed by Joseph Strauss, who designed the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.
The La Salle Causeway was named after René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle. who oversaw the construction of Fort Frontenac in 1673 at what is now the western end of the causeway.


== History ==
The first attempt at transportation across the river was a cable-operated scow type of ferry that began operating in 1786. Two rowboats were often available for use as well.In 1826, the Cataraqui Bridge Company was formed to build a wooden bridge ""1800 feet long by 25 feet wide and built on stone piers"" (549 × 7.6 m). The Cataraqui Bridge was opened in 1829. Tolls were collected from a toll booth on the west end of the bridge, and since pedestrians were charged a penny, the bridge was popularly known as the ""Penny Bridge."" A drawbridge allowed larger vessels to pass through but was eventually replaced by an easier-to-operate swing bridge.
In 1917, the Penny Bridge was replaced by the causeway which included three bridges: two bridges at each end of the causeway, and the centre lift bridge.  Only the original centre lift bridge remains since the steel bridges at the east and the west ends of the causeway were replaced with concrete bridges in 1962 and 1993, respectively.

Pelo then moved back to Queensland, originally signing a short-term deal with the Burleigh Bears club in the Queensland Cup in the hope of securing a longer-term deal with the Gold Coast Titans in the National Rugby League (NRL).
During the end of the 2006 season, the Gold Coast club displayed interest in Pelo, selecting him in several early trial matches and a sevens competition but ultimately he was unsuccessful in securing any deal with the club so began to look abroad. For the beginning of the 2007 season Pelo signed a deal with the French club Catalans Dragons.
He was named in the France training squad for the 2008 Rugby League World Cup.He was named in the France squad for the 2008 Rugby League World Cup.He switched codes for the 2010/11 season, playing for Montpellier Hérault RC.In December 2011 he trialled with the Canberra Raiders with the hope of gaining a first-grade contract after the departure of Daniel Vidot to the St. George Illawarra Dragons.

"Rio Cinema, Dalston","The Rio Cinema is a Grade II listed independent Art Deco cinema in Dalston, east London. It is a popular independent cinema located on Kingsland High Street, with a history stretching back over 100 years. The Rio added a second screen in the unused basement space in December 2017.The Rio was named one of London's best cinemas by the Daily Telegraph and best cinema bars by the Evening Standard.


== Programming and events ==
The programme usually includes one main feature film each week, chosen by Executive Director Oliver Meek and head projectionist Peter Howden. These range from arthouse to blockbusters. There is usually a Saturday late show, Bargain Mondays, Tuesday discounts for Hackney Library Card holders, and regular Parents and Babies screenings. The Rio also works with programming partners such as the East End Film Festival, The London Feminist Film Festival, Doc'n Roll and the Fringe! Gay Film Fest.
It also hosts film festivals including the annual Turkish Film Festival, which began at the cinema in 1994.
As a charity, the cinema undertakes cultural outreach through cut-price tickets for the children's and community screenings, schools events, and a monthly classic matinee for over-60s. Every year hundreds of school children attend film screenings and educational events at the Rio Cinema.
The building is open 364 days a year, with over 1300 screenings annually. The stalls on the ground floor seat 188, and the circle (open on busy days) seats 214, the new second screen in the basement seats 28 with a wheelchair space.


== History ==


=== Kingsland Palace & Kingsland Empire ===
The building was originally an auctioneer's shop, converted into the Kingsland Palace in 1909 by owner Clara Ludski. It was one of five cinemas in Dalston and an immediate hit.
Its success led to properties either side being bought up, and the architect George Coles was commissioned to design a new single-screen picturehouse. Construction began in 1913, and the Kingsland Empire opened in 1915.
The Kingsland Empire's style was 'late Edwardian neo-classical'. There was a two-level tea room, domed tower, and an elaborate auditorium featuring five side arches and a proscenium with double Ionic columns either side, topped by a frieze. English Heritage say that the original Kingsland Empire was ""more theatrical in planning and decoration than most cinemas of that date"".


=== 1930s Art Deco ===
In 1933 the cinema was purchased from Clara Ludski by London & Southern Cinemas Ltd, and in 1936 by Capital & Provincial News Theatres (who became at that time the Classic Cinema chain..
The building was refurbished in Art Deco style by cult architect FE Bromige in 1937 and reopened as the Classic  Cinema Dalston, within the shell of the earlier cinema. The ceiling and upper walls of the earlier auditorium survive, only accessible from the roof. As many cinemas were remodelled with the arrival of sound in the 1930s, nowhere else are two very different auditoria found one within the other. According to English Heritage, this is ""an exceptionally rare survival"". The exterior has remained almost unchanged since the thirties.
F E Bromige achieved a remarkable sense of rhythm and movement through simple means in his few cinemas, all in North London, and he has emerged as a specialist cinema architect of rare originality.


=== 1940s to early 1970s ===
The Classic sustained bomb blast damage during the Blitz in 1941 when a high explosive bomb fell across the street in Birkbeck Mews. In the early 1950s the cinema received a makeover with simplified signage and neon, in 1958 it became the Classic Cartoon Theatre, and in 1960 it became the Classic Continental showing foreign language films, and its next guise was as a Tatler Cinema Club in 1971 screening uncensored adult films with live striptease burlesque acts on stage.


=== 1976 to present day ===
In 1976 the cinema came under independent cooperative management. Since 1979 it has been run as a not-for-profit registered charity with an elected board of local people who act as volunteer trustees. The current chairman of the board is Patrick Lyons.
The blue and pink Art Deco interior was restored in 1997, remaining faithful to Bromige's design, and the building became Grade II listed in 1999. Elain Harwood of English Heritage called the cinema a 'remarkable' work of ‘sweeping curves’.
The bus stop outside the building was renamed as 'Rio Cinema' in 2012 after thousands of people successfully petitioned Transport for London.
Local people were warned  to 'use it or lose it' as box office revenues declined in 2013. Over £4000 was raised, and the cinema seems determined to live on.In August 2016 it was announced that a second screen would be added in the basement space of the Rio, opening in summer 2017.
In 2017 the cinema successfully raised £125,000 to restore the art deco exterior and build a second screen in the large basement space, the second screen seating 28 opened in December 2017.
In May 2019, the cinema opened a new bar in the basement space, next to the second screen. The bar was named the Ludski Bar, in tribute to Clara Ludski, the original owner of the cinema.

She worked on the parasites that feed on small freshwater crustaceans (Daphnia), using them as a ""model system for understanding host-parasite interactions in general"". She found that ecological context was important when gauging epidemic size, and that when some parasites are ""battling an epidemic of a deadly parasite, less resistance can sometimes be better than more"". In 2012 she won the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers, which was presented to her by Barack Obama.Duffy joined University of Michigan in 2012. Her research concentrates on rapid evolutionary responses in novel host-parasite associations. She is currently researching the influences of food webs and eco-evolutionary dynamics on host-parasite interactions and multi-host, multi-parasite interactions. Duffy is concerned about cuts to basic research funding.


=== Public engagement ===
Duffy established the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB) Mentor Match, which pairs undergraduate students from minority-serving institutions with mentors to help with graduate school and fellowship applications. Duffy created Diversity EEB, a list of ecologists / evolutionary biologists who are women or from a group traditionally underrepresented in the sciences to help people identify scientists who might diversify seminar series or for award nominations.

Streetwise (1998 film),"Streetwise (originally titled as 24/7) is a 1998 hood-action-crime thriller film written and directed by Bruce Brown in his directorial debut, and stars Tim Taylor, Kurt Matthews, Jerry Cummings, D.C. Scorpio and Sidney Burston. Streetwise also stars Taraji P. Henson making her acting debut in a featured film.The film is set in the Anacostia neighborhood of Southeast, Washington, D.C. during the crack epidemic of the late-1980s and early-1990s. Streetwise follows the lives of three brothers as they pursue different methods trying to make it out of their drug-infested neighborhood that's surrounded by poverty, neglect and drug-related violence. In 2004, a sequel was released, called Divided City.


== Plot ==
Eric Walker (Tim Taylor) along with his oldest brother Donte Walker (Kurt Matthews) and their friend Loco (D.C. Scorpio) are drug dealers who have a small-time operation selling crack on the corners of Talbert Street in their Anacostia neighborhood in Southeast, D.C. On the street corners, they have to worry about muggers such as 11:30 (a mentally-deranged stick-up kid who's served time in St. Elizabeths Hospital and who's fascinated with killing street thugs and then hurrying home to watch the aftermath on the 11:30 nightly news.)
Eric's youngest brother Michael (Jerry Cummings) is different from the older brothers and is more focused on perfecting his skills in hip-hop and go-go music, along with having dreams of receiving a major record deal. Their mother (Henri Edmonds) is very protective of Michael and doesn't want him going in the same direction as his two older brothers (Eric and Donte) who have become entrenched in the extremely violent drug-infested streets, during a time when D.C. was labeled the ""Murder Capital of the United States"". As a result, she keeps him on a very tight-leash, so overbearing that Michael feels like he's imprisoned.
Tammy (Taraji Henson) is an unmarried single-mother working as a hairdresser at ""Hair Quarters"", who neglects her young son. Instead, she parties heavily at the clubs and dates drug hustlers promiscuously. She doesn't believe there are any good men left in the world, and has chosen to live for the moment.
Her mother (Bunny Dorsett) encourages Tammy to straighten up her life and provide motherly guidance for her son; else she'll report her to the Child Protection Services for child neglect. Tammy eventually turns away from the fast-paced chasing-drug hustler's lifestyle and seeks counseling from the Max Robinson Community Center after thinking long about her mother's advice.
Since ""streetlife"" is what Donte knows best, he wants to leave the 'nickel and dimes' dealings and use his street knowledge to maximize their presence beyond their neighborhood and into other profitable neighborhoods in the city (including Raymond's lucrative territories in Northwest, D.C.) Donte is irritated by outsiders like Raymond (Sidney Burston), a drug lord who comes into their neighborhood and make millions of dollars selling crack off of their street corners. Donte convinces Eric and Loco that it's time to go big and expand their footprint into Raymond's territory.
In time, Donte has an unexpected run-in at a crack-house with Raymond's girlfriend Tiffany (an all-girl's prep school educated drug-addict). She came looking for cocaine, since Raymond refused to give her any. Donte offers to provide her cocaine in exchange for sex, which she agrees. After sex, Donte tries to get inside information of Raymond's drug operation. Tiffany instead gives up Raymond's daily whereabouts, including the weekly haircuts every Wednesday at 10:00 AM at Charlie's barbershop.
Donte uses the information to attempt an assassination of Raymond. Donte and Loco go to kill Raymond at the barbershop. However, they mistakenly kill the wrong person. Raymond (who was in the backroom witnessing) recognized Donte and immediately plans retaliation for ""The Walker Boys"". Members of his crew kidnap Michael and bring him to Raymond, where he's executed. This enrages Donte and Eric as they seek vengeance against Raymond, which climaxes into an all-out bloody street war between Donte, Raymond, and other neighborhood rivals.


== Cast ==
(All cast members were credited as ""The Players"")


== Production ==
Streetwise was filmed in and around the Washington metropolitan area, but primarily in the Anacostia neighborhood of Southeast, Washington, D.C. Several iconic landmarks are featured throughout the film, including the Barry Farms Dwellings (where the Walker family lived), The Awakening sculpture (when it was located in Hains Point), the graffiti Wall of Sheridan Terrace, the Cadillac Motel (in Brandywine, Maryland), Anacostia Park and the Big Chair. Several well-known locals made cameos throughout the film, including James ""Jas Funk"" Thomas (of the go-go band Rare Essence), Tony ""Big Tony"" Fisher (of the go-go band Trouble Funk), the radio personality Konan (credited as ""CJ""), and DJ Kool.
Although Brown chose fictional characters, comparison could be drawn between Raymond and Rayful Edmond III (a legendary drug lord in D.C.), who was as ruthless in real life as that of Raymond. However, Edmond's final fate was abated by prison instead of death.


== Release ==
Streetwise screened for a few months exclusively at the ""AMC Rivertowne Commons 12 Theatre"" in Oxon Hill, Maryland before being released on VHS in 1998, and released on DVD in 2004 through Maverick Home Entertainment.


== Soundtrack ==
The original soundtrack for Streetwise was released on Capital City Records and included original musical performances by Drama City, Inner City Groove, Junkyard Band, Rare Essence, Triple Threat, and Trouble Funk. The album is currently out-of-print.

The rich get richer and the poor get poorer,"""The rich get richer and the poor get poorer"" is an aphorism attributed to Percy Bysshe Shelley. In A Defence of Poetry (1821, not published until 1840) Shelley remarked that the promoters of utility had exemplified the saying, ""To him that hath, more shall be given; and from him that hath not, the little that he hath shall be taken away. The rich have become richer, and the poor have become poorer; and the vessel of the State is driven between the Scylla and Charybdis of anarchy and despotism."" It describes a positive feedback loop (a corresponding negative feedback loop would be e.g. progressive tax).
""To him that hath"" etc. is a reference to Matthew 25:29 (the parable of the talents, see also Matthew effect). The aphorism is commonly evoked, with variations in wording, as a synopsis of the effect of free market capitalism producing excessive inequality.


== Predecessors ==
Andrew Jackson, the seventh President of the U.S. (1829–1837), in his 1832 bank veto, said that ""when the laws undertake ... to make the rich richer and the potent more powerful, the humble members of society ... have a right to complain of the injustice to their Government."" The phrase also has connections to Martial's epigrams. In one of his epigrams, he states, ""You will always be poor, if you are poor, Aemiliane. Now money is given to none except the rich.""
The phrase also resembles two Bible verses from the Gospel of Matthew:

For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath ...For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.


== ""Ain't We Got Fun"" ==
The phrase was popularized in 1921 in the wildly successful song ""Ain't We Got Fun?"", and the phrase is sometimes attributed to the song's lyricists, Gus Kahn and Raymond B. Egan.
The line is sometimes mistakenly attributed to F. Scott Fitzgerald. It appears in The Great Gatsby, as ""the rich get richer and the poor get—children!"" The character Gatsby orders the character Klipspringer, sitting at the piano, ""Don't talk so much, old sport... Play!"" and Klipspringer breaks into the Whiting, Kahn and Egan song.


== In economics ==
Thomas Piketty's book Capital in the Twenty-First Century (2014) presents a body of empirical data spanning several hundred years that supports his central thesis that the owners of capital accumulate wealth more quickly than those who provide labour, a phenomenon widely described with the term ""the rich-get-richer"".


== In modern politics ==
In the United States, the phrase has been used frequently to describe socioeconomic trends under the Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush presidencies, and in the United Kingdom to refer to the Thatcher era. In 1990, Thatcher responded to a question posed in the House of Commons by the Liberal Democrat MP Simon Hughes about wealth inequality in the UK by saying ""he would rather that the poor were poorer, provided that the rich were less rich. ... What a policy. Yes, he would rather have the poor poorer, provided that the rich were less rich. That is the Liberal policy."" It has also been used in the UK to refer to the 2010–2015 coalition and 2015–2016 governments led by David Cameron.


== Other uses ==
In statistics, the phrase ""the rich get richer"" is often used as an informal description of the behavior of Chinese restaurant processes and other preferential attachment processes, where the probability of the next outcome in a series taking on a particular value is proportional to the number of outcomes already having that particular value.  This is useful for modeling many real-world processes that are akin to ""popularity contests"", where the popularity of a particular choice causes new participants to adopt the same choice (which can lead to the outsized influence of the first few participants).
Product recommendations and information about past purchases have been shown to influence consumers choices significantly whether it is for music, movie, book, technological, and other type of products. Social influence often induces a rich-get-richer phenomenon (Matthew effect) where popular products tend to become even more popular.

Monkman Pass,"Monkman Pass, in the Canadian Rockies, is southwest of Tumbler Ridge and northeast of Hansard. Found in the Hart Ranges, some consider this mountain pass as the southern limit of the informal grouping known as the Northern Rockies, although those are occasionally reckoned as extending farther southeast to Mount Ovington or even to Mount Robson.
The pass is at the head of the Murray River and south of the height of land at the head of the Parsnip River.Monkman Pass forms part of Monkman Provincial Park. Like the park, Monkman Lake, Monkman Creek and Monkman Falls, it was named after Alexander Monkman.


== History ==


=== Discovery ===
By the 1920s, Monkman Pass had been a First Nations travel route for some 300 years.
Alex Monkman was a pioneer trader and trapper in the Peace Country. According to his account, while on a westward trapping and hunting trip in the 1921/22 winter, he realized he had crossed the continental divide through a lower pass, either on locating a spike from the 1904 Grand Trunk survey, or on meeting trappers who had canoed from the Fraser River.St. Pierre Gauthier (c.1850–c.1930), is also claimed as the discoverer. With a skilled eye for topography, he was reputed to be an expert trail locator. Of French-Cree ancestry, he spoke some English but was otherwise illiterate. Supposedly, after leading Monkman to the pass, the latter, being literate and well known, assumed the credit.Hank Munro, a leading trapper in the area, was acknowledged by George Woosley as the true discoverer. Allegedly, Munro informed Monkman of its existence when railway fever was gripping the region.


=== Railway proposal ===
During the early 1900s, grain and cattle from the Peace Country in Alberta and B.C. were primarily exported to the west coast by way of Edmonton—a circuitous 1,441 miles (2,319 km) by rail to Vancouver, which by a direct route would be only 733 miles (1,180 km). By 1920, grain prices were low and freight rates high, and many settlers, who had been attracted by repeated government assurances that a line would be built imminently, were forced to abandon their holdings.
Monkman reported his findings to the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) and the Canadian National Railway (CNR), and guided reconnaissance engineer E. Murray Hill through the pass in 1923. When CNR president, Sir Henry Thornton, visited the Peace Country in 1924, he promised to build a railroad westward when the region produced tonnage equal to 10 million imperial bushels (360,000 m3) of wheat. That volume surpassed within two years, no railway materialized.
The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTP) surveys during 1904–06 examined a Wapiti Pass line southwestward to Hansard, as did the 1920s surveys through Monkman Pass, with the latter offering a superior grade west of the Canadian Rockies. Via the CNR at Hansard would be 150 miles (240 km) shorter than either the Pine or Peace passes for shipping Peace wheat, and would require less than 160 miles (260 km) of new track to connect with the CPR controlled Edmonton, Dunvegan and British Columbia Railway. However, a branch line northwest from Brule, Alberta was the CNR preference.The CNR, reliant upon an unenthusiastic parliament for funding, and satisfied with their Yellowhead crossing, and the CPR leaning toward the Pine or Peace, Monkman Pass presented a compromise proposal that connected CNR tracks to the west with CPR tracks to the east. If a further line through the mountains were economically viable, railway survey engineers favoured the Monkman route, because of lighter snowfall and no chance of slides in a 0.25-mile (0.40 km) wide pass at its narrowest.Bypassing their farms, this option drew protest from the northern Peace. Residents unfairly compared this choice to the then Pacific Great Eastern Railway (PGE), which ""started nowhere, ended nowhere, and served no settlers"". For nearly 100 miles (160 km) of the Monkman route, there were neither mines, good agricultural land nor timber belts. The Brule branch, or a modified alternative through Obed, Alberta, equally lacked appeal.The respective cost estimates were: Obed $13,336,000; Monkman Pass $16,092,000; and Pine Pass $21,472,000. In terms of cost benefit, the federal government favoured Monkman, but the CNR and CPR chose Obed. For all participants, delay, not construction, was their prime objective. The exercise created some uncertainty as to whether the PGE would build through the Monkman Pass or follow its earlier surveys north toward the Pine or Peace passes. In 1928, the PGE conducted a joint survey with the CNR and CPR of these three possible routes. Meanwhile, British capitalists were considering building a Monkman line independent of the CNR or CPR. 
During 1930, one of the four CPR survey parties in the Canadian Rockies examined the Monkman, but unspecified doubts harmed its ranking. When a boat freighting supplies to this survey camp capsized in the McGregor River, one of the two occupants drowned.Though the Peace Pass was favoured, the projected traffic did not warrant the expenditure, but the railway companies were open to the federal government constructing a line. By 1937, the volunteer work on the Monkman road renewed a vision for a rail line. Politicians lamented that if the existence of the Monkman Pass had been known earlier, it could well have become a rail route, but the GTP rationale makes the claim questionable. The slump in the Asian wheat trade in the 1930s terminated any national interest.In 1953, a storm of protest erupted from the northern Peace when B.C. and Alberta discussed the possibility of routing the proposed PGE line through the Monkman Pass. In 1958, the PGE opened a Pine Pass link from Prince George to Dawson Creek, where the line connected with the Northern Alberta Railways. One reason for this choice was that the Monkman option would have delayed the opening until 1960.By the late 1970s, a railway line through the Monkman Pass area was foreseen as part of developing the Tumbler Ridge coal deposits. Reversing an agreement for the CNR to build the line through the pass, the B.C. government opted for the more expensive alternative of a BC Rail Tumbler Ridge Subdivision, passing 30 miles (48 km) northwest of the pass. Having five times the length of tunnelling and worse grades, this choice repeated the fiascos of the Dease Lake and Fort Nelson extensions. Although BC Hydro had previously decided not to dam the McGregor River, the government had apparently not ruled out this option. Consequently, the alternative proposal via Hansard had assessed this possibility.Sharp curves and long unventilated tunnels were a feature of the line built. Channeled away from live overhead wires, water pouring from the roof of one tunnel section beneath a lake was called the ""carwash"". With coal mines closing between 2000–03 on the Tumbler Ridge Subdivision, the government did not recover its $400 million capital investment before progressively abandoning parts of the route. After temporarily recommissioning the line, a loaded 13-car coal train derailed in 2007, as did a 15-car loaded train in 2014. The line abandoned in 2014, CNR continued to transport coal over a circuitous route, until the whole line reopened after a six-month rehabilitation in 2017.


=== Highway Proposal, Construction Progress & Impact ===
In 1925, the Surveyor General released a report on constructing a wagon road. After frustration in not securing a direct rail link, the Peace Country newspapers launched a campaign to build a highway from Prince George via Hansard and the Monkman Pass to Beaverlodge, Alberta. Ideal for tourism, transporting produce would be limited, because weather conditions would restrict its use to four or five months a year. The Wapiti Pass, an alternative route, suffered the same deficiency.A 1933 petition signed by affected residents urged the federal government to provide a highway. Parliament debated the proposal of building through either the Peace, Pine, Wapiti or Monkman passes. Tired of waiting, a group gathered at a 1936 meeting in Arthur Smith's farmhouse near Lake Saskatoon, Alberta. They formed the Monkman Pass Highway Association to construct a 132-mile (212 km) road between Rio Grande, Alberta, and the highway at Hansard, following the route previously surveyed by the railways. Arthur became publicity director. A dirt road already existed from Beaverlodge to Rio Grande.This route (newspaper overview map) would be cheaper than the circuitous Turgeon Highway, which was under construction, but progressing slowly. Federal funding for both highways was highly unlikely. Initially, the Yellowhead Highway Association believed the proposal equally jeopardized their potential funding for linking Longworth with McBride, but ultimately lent their support. The Monkman team persevered with their lobbying of the federal and provincial governments, maintaining the position that all such projects were worthy of support. George Richardson (see #Oil & Natural Gas Development) drove cattle through the pass in 1937.Work commenced from Rio Grande in June 1937. The 20-man crew each volunteered two weeks labour, after which they were eligible for an additional two weeks at $1 a day plus board. The Alberta government loaned used tents, and citizens donated tools, stores, labour and money. The route would reduce the auto journey from the Peace Country to Vancouver by 900 miles (1,400 km). By mid-August, the 65-mile (105 km) Beaverlodge-Stoney Lake section was passable by vehicle. For the 47-mile (76 km) Stoney Lake-McGregor River portion, packhorses were needed. For the 20-mile (32 km) McGregor River-Hansard balance, an advance party led by Alex Monkman had blazed a trail. The Rio Grande-Stoney Lake road was not initially suitable for a car, but a truck with some help up gullies and stream banks could achieve five mph (8 km/h). By yearend, newspapers across Canada had published maps of the proposed highway, but politicians remained focused upon the Turgeon highway. Fundraising efforts continued and further branches of the association formed. The B.C. government provided no financial support, nor did Ottawa, but some politicians voiced their approval.In the summer, a 250-man Alberta crew recommenced the work, keeping connected to the Finlay Forks radiotelephone station by a portable radio transmitter. A four-man B.C. team surveying a Herrick River-Hansard route through the McGregor River country experienced a narrow escape from wildlife. When a party of four, guided by trapper Martin Framstad, carried a symbolic 50-pound sack of Marquis Wheat (grown on Arthur Smith's farm) across the pass, it was the first commercial produce to come directly overland from the Peace Country. Their travails included four days of driving rain, and nearly drowning on the north fork of the swift McGregor River. At this point, they abandoned their packhorses and carried everything on their backs for the final 10 miles (16 km), emerging at the CNR line three miles (4.8 km) east of Hansard.By July, in addition to loaning camping equipment, the Alberta government had provided slip and Fresno scrapers and plows for the 15-mile (24 km) section within that province. While the Rio Grande-Stoney Lake section awaited final grading, the next 20 miles were passable by truck and a pack trail existed for the remainder. Proceeding from Hansard, by month end, the three-man-slashing crew had created a 10-foot wide trail for five miles (8 km). Meanwhile, Rio Grande-Kinuseo Falls was passable by truck. A 60-foot length bridge across the river was under construction. Three weeks later, the western end was at the six-mile (10 km) mark, with a trail for the 8–10 miles to the McGregor/Herrick crossing. Funding limited the crew size and progress. 
In mid-September, the ""Pathfinder"" car (a 1927 Model T Ford, modified as a light truck fitted with a ruckstel axle to improve gearing), headed westward with a set of replacement parts. Meanwhile, reporters from two national newspapers journeyed the route, completing the final section from the McGregor to Hansard by boat. Expected in Prince George by early November, the ""Pathfinder"" had struggled through days of one-foot deep snow, before Francis Murphy's 16-man and four-horse team reached Henry Hobi's cabin at the junction of Moose Creek and Herrick River. Having covered 39 miles (63 km) from Kinuseo Falls, they met Ole Hanson, who had waited weeks with his boat. The local trappers had cut four miles (6.4 km) of virgin bush and assisted the hauling. After transporting out the sick passengers, the frozen river prevented the boat's return. The planned ferrying of the vehicle down the McGregor River to Hansard postponed indefinitely would undermine the publicity opportunity. Both Canadian and international newspapers had widely reported the roadbuilding effort.In June 1939, repairs began on the 75 miles (121 km) of completed road, with the Alberta government assuming responsibility for the section within its border. The federal government agreed to match any funds the B.C. government spent on the road, but the latter, regarding the road primarily a federal responsibility, made no financial commitments. Although originally proposing a regular service to Monkman Lake, the specially equipped tractor busses only ran as far as Kinuseo Falls. Leaving Beaverlodge at 8 am, they arrived at the falls the next morning. That summer, an eight-man crew continued tackling the Hansard end of the road. The endeavour continued during the earlier months of World War II, but afterward ceased beyond maintaining the eastern section.
The lodge at Kinuseo Falls, and the lodge, general store and restaurant at Stony Lake, which sprang up, received considerable patronage. Attempts to revive efforts for a connecting highway continued. With the Alaska Highway a reality, Monkman Pass again became a contender for the highway link with Prince George. Although surveyed, it lost out to Pine Pass. As the war progressed, the lodges closed. Following the war, the B.C. government prohibited any further work on the road. 
While making a Beaverlodge-Hansard hike in the summer of 1951, a trio's encounter with fellow beings was limited to a few First Nations campers at Stony Lake and Henry Hobi at his Fontoniko Creek cabin. By 1956, The Hansard-Grande Prairie route was one of a series of isolated locations in need of pioneer roads to access natural resources. The next year, Ferry Strobl of Pine Pass was one of a party of three local men who visited the abandoned ""Pathfinder"". Following an intense 1961 air and land search, a long overdue father and his two young sons, attempting to reach Hansard, were rescued five miles (8 km) south of Monkman Lake. In 1967, a 17-member team, including Gerry Stojan, one of the original drivers, retrieved the ""Pathfinder"", bringing it first to Prince George to complete its historic journey. It continued to Grande Prairie for restoration and display in the Grande Prairie Museum.In 1976, Wayne Monkman, in the footsteps of his grandfather, Alexander Monkman, led a nine-member attempt to cross the pass in four-wheel-drive trucks. Travelling from the west, the deep muddy logging roads delayed their progress. When their permit to cross the salmon-spawning Fontoniko Creek expired, the expedition prematurely ended. Government officials denied a further request to access the area from the east. When a fuel tanker overturned the following year, 2,000 gallons of spilled diesel exploded, killing the driver.Despite widespread local support, the government opposed a road through the pass as part of developing the Tumbler Ridge coal deposits, possibly owing to a potential McGregor dam (see #Railway Proposal). Rejecting the $100-million Monkman option, the province spent $94 million on a Chetwynd-Tumbler Ridge highway, but the region continued to lobby for a Monkman link.


=== Aircraft ===
In 1938, United Air Transport (UAT) began flying their Prince George-Edmonton route via Monkman Pass. The next year, UAT, renamed Yukon Southern Air Transport (YSAT), introduced a direct Prince George-Grande Prairie route over the pass.In 1965, when Prince George lumber executive Ross Davis’ light plane went missing on a flight from Grande Prairie to Prince George, it prompted a 10-day aerial search in the pass area. Six weeks later, the apparent sighting of wreckage triggered a resumption of the search, but this was determined to be just a patch of ice. The following month, a helicopter pilot made a chance discovery of the Cessna 180 wreckage in a lonely wind swept canyon near the pass. Accompanied by two police officers, this pilot recovered the body. The same year, a solo pilot, flying from Grande Prairie to Chetwynd, became lost overnight in a blinding snowstorm in the Monkman Pass area. Low on fuel, the Cessna 180 safely landed on a small airstrip.In 1974, a Piper Apache made an emergency landing onto the frozen Monkman Lake. Spending 24 hours in the crashed plane, the three occupants suffered from minor to serious injuries.


=== Oil & Natural Gas Development ===
Premier Pattullo, a prospector for oil during the late 1930s, adopted an obstructive exploration policy while in government, which motivated the oil companies to help fund the Liberal party defeat in the 1941 provincial elections. His successor, Premier Hart, offered 160 acres on which to drill. His informing lessees they could sell the gas, but any oil would be the property of the province, crushed any incentive to invest.In the 1920s, while George Richardson was homesteading near Monkman Pass, an old prospector insisted fossils indicated the presence of oil, but the evidence was largely ignored. The natural gas seeping from the ground, which attracted clawing bears, had no immediate value. Using the partially built road to access the area, a syndicate led by George made a major oil discovery in 1952, which attracted the attention of oil companies and news reporters. Stanolind Oil struck oil in 1956, but no B.C. wells had moved from the drilling stage to production. The following year, Richfield Oil Corp. abandoned a runaway gas well after spending over $2 million, because of equipment losses and misinterpreting seismograph findings.During the 1960s, as one of three possible routes for the Taylor-Kamloops oil pipeline route, the pass was rejected because its inaccessibility would hamper maintenance. Under contract to the Peace River Petroleums and Central del Rio consortium, Gray Oil Co. drilled for natural gas two miles (3.2 km) south of Stony Lake in Grizzly Valley, near the abandoned Richfield well. Gray Oil also drilled nine miles (14 km) south of Stony Lake for a Peace River Petroleums, Richfield, Central Del Rio, Northwest Pacific Development and Grizzly Valley Gas and Oil Co., consortium. The area represented the biggest gas-bearing anticline ln Western Canada.One well produced eight million cubic feet of sweet gas daily, but alone was insufficient to build a pipeline. Further unsuccessful and productive wells were drilled. A planned natural gas pipeline to Northwood pulp mill in Prince George was scrapped. To survive financially, Peace River Petroleums entered a partnership with Imperial Oil, which assumed all drilling costs, but the former was soon delisted from the Vancouver Stock Exchange for failing to file relevant statements.The switch to natural gas encouraged exploration in the 1960s, but drilling intensified owing to the 1973 oil crisis. Another exploding natural gas well was capped within days. The Alberta and Southern group sought to connect the Monkman field to their Alberta pipeline network. In 1993, BP Canada found huge gas reserves in the Monkman Pass area. In 2008, Spectra Energy connected the Grizzly Valley to its pipeline network, but five years later, the company deactivated segments of pipeline in response to falling production.

Bryan Autoplane,"The Bryan Autoplanes were a series of three experimental roadable aircraft.


== Development ==
Leland Bryan built his roadable aircraft in the town of Milford, Michigan. As a roadable aircraft the aircraft was required to be registered by both the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) and the Michigan Motor Vehicle Administration (MMVA), with road propulsion provided by propeller thrust.


== Design ==
The Bryan Model I was built with a welded steel tube fuselage frame, wings from a Briegleb BG-6 primary glider and a Crosley automobile engine, which was later replaced by a 40 hp Continental.The Model II autoplane featured an extended Erco Ercoupe center-section, with a pusher engine at the rear of the fuselage nacelle, with twin tail booms supporting the tail section. The Ercoupe landing gear was used for the roadable operations, reaching up to 60 mph on the road. For storage and road transport the wings folded at two hinge lines.


== Operational history ==
The Model I was approved for limited flight, in the experimental category. by the CAA, managing to accumulate 500 miles of road driving, and flying for the first time in 1953. The improved Model II achieved 80 hours of flight time and 4000 miles of road travel before a road accident. During repairs the Model II was rebuilt with two-seats becoming the Model III Autoplane, with a Continental A75 engine and convertible top motors, from a Chevrolet Corvair, to extend and fold the wings. After accumulating 70 hours of flight time and 1000 road miles, the Model III crashed during a flyby at the 1974 Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) airshow, at Oshkosh, Wisconsin, when an inadequately secured wing section parted company killing the designer. At the time of his death Leland Bryan was in the process of designing the Model IV Autoplane, based on a Rutan VariViggen.

The Men Who Make the Music combines concert footage from Devo's 1978 tour with music videos and interstitials featuring a vague story about Devo's rocky relationship with ""Big Entertainment"". The majority of this story line is contained in a long segment called ""Roll Out the Barrel"" or ""Rod Rooter's Big Ream""/""Rod's Big Reamer"". This particular segment was shown as an intermission during Devo's 1979 tour and audio recordings appear on bootlegs from this tour. Part of this film also appears on The Complete Truth About Devolution. The other interstitials involve General Boy (Robert Mothersbaugh, Sr.) discussing Devo's influence on the world and their philosophy. Members of Devo also make speeches during these interstitials.

Northwest Arkansas National Airport,"Northwest Arkansas National Airport (IATA: XNA, ICAO: KXNA, FAA LID: XNA) is in Northwest Arkansas in Benton County, Arkansas, United States, 15 nautical miles (28 km; 17 mi) northwest of Fayetteville and 10 nautical miles (19 km; 12 mi) northwest of Springdale.  It is often referred to by its IATA code, which is incorporated in the airport's logo as ""Fly XNA"".
It sees year-round, daily nonstop jets to major cities such as Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis/St. Paul, New York City, and Washington D.C. Much of its business is attributable to the presence of the world's largest company by revenue, Walmart, in nearby Bentonville, as well as Tyson Foods in Springdale. It is also frequently used by athletic teams at the University of Arkansas traveling to away games and Razorback opponents visiting Fayetteville. 
Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 547,871 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 530,087 in 2009 and 549,195 in 2010. It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2019–2023, in which it is categorized as a small-hub primary commercial service facility.


== History ==
XNA opened in November 1998. It replaced Fayetteville's Drake Field as the region's main airport with scheduled airline passenger flights. By the early 1990s, Drake Field had become too small to accommodate the growing traffic that the expanding region was generating.


=== Expansion ===
In 2007, airport officials announced the construction of a new concourse costing between $20 million and $25 million.  The new facility, east of the upper concourse, has allowed the airport to increase its number of airplane parking positions from twelve to twenty. Building the new facility took over three years.The airport completed a ticket counter expansion in 2010. The airport has completed a $21 million expansion to the upper-level concourse that includes the state's first moving walkway. With the walkway, it is anticipated to take about three minutes to get from security to the last gate. The addition adds 51,000 square feet (4,700 m2) and twelve upper-level gates to the east side of the airport.The airport was previously known as Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport. It adopted the name Northwest Arkansas National Airport in December 2019. Airport officials attributed the change to perception, saying that the new name would help attract more airline service.On September 23, 2021, it was announced that Board members took the first steps toward adding a new, second concourse. The board voted to have staff negotiate with Fentress Architects for conceptual drawings for the first phase of Concourse B. The design work will cost about $185,000.The new concourse would allow the airport to use its boarding gates more efficiently. The Board are contemplating bringing some gates on Concourse A back into use for certain aircraft sizes and redesigning others. Phase One would include an elevated walkway, a hold room for passengers and a covered walkway out to a ground-level loading area onto the aircraft. Construction of the project is estimated to cost roughly $35 million to $50 million. Longer range plans call for building out Concourse B to roughly match Concourse A.


=== Runway ===
The original runway built in 1998 required complete reconstruction in 2011, following the discovery of alkali-silica reaction (ASR) in its Portland cement concrete. Since the runway was the only one at the airport, a temporary runway was necessary to maintain service during reconstruction. Stimulus funds of $9 million ($12.3 million in today's dollars) from the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) allowed XNA to accelerate the alternative runway construction project. Upon completion of the alternate runway in 2012, all aircraft operations were shifted to the new surface and demolition and replacement of the primary runway began.


=== Access Road ===
A proposed access road connecting the airport with the new Springdale Bypass (US-412) was part of a ½ cent statewide sales tax continuation amendment. This was passed by voters on November 3, 2020. As of February 10, 2021, three alternatives were brought to public comment with a live meeting scheduled March 2, 2021.


== Facilities ==
The airport covers 2,184 acres (884 ha) at an elevation of 1,287 feet (392 m). It has two runways, 16R/34L and 16L/34R. 16L/34R is 8,801 feet long by 150 feet (2,683 x 46 m) wide and 16R/34L is 8,800 feet long by 150 feet (2,682 x 46 m) wide.In the year ending May 31, 2021, the airport had 28,440 aircraft operations, average 78 per day: 45% airline, 9% air taxi, 30% military, and 15% general aviation. In May 2021, eight aircraft were based at the airport:  one single-engine, three multi-engine, and four jet.

Cash return on capital invested,"Cash return on capital invested (CROCI) is an advanced measure of corporate profitability, originally developed by Deutsche Bank's equity research department in 1996 (it now sits within DWS Group). This measure compares a post-tax, pre-interest cash flow to the gross level of capital invested and is a useful measure of a company’s ability to generate cash returns on its investments.
In principle, this ratio is similar to the ROE ratio, but CROCI is calculated on a cash basis and on an EV-basis, taking into account assets funded by all the company's security-holders.


== Formula ==
CROCI is calculated as the internal rate of return in a particular year of a company's gross post-tax cash flows after investing the gross capital invested over the total asset life of the firm. In principle, this should be equivalent to the ratio of the free cash flow of that year to the net capital invested, provided depreciation is calculated economically and the only capex is for maintenance.


== Uses ==
The (CROCI – WACC) spread is a key measure of shareholder value creation and competitive advantage. If the spread is positive, a company creates value and destroys it otherwise.
The CROCI/WACC ratio is basically the same metric signaling value creation or destruction. If the ratio is higher than 1, a company creates value, and it destroys value if the ratio is below 1.
CROCI can be compared to a company's economic price to book (broadly equivalent to a company's Tobin's Q) to calculate an Economic P/E.

Health in Tuvalu,"As in much of Oceania, obesity is a major health issue in Tuvalu with 65% of men and 71% of women being overweight.  In 2012 the birth rate on the islands was estimated at 23 per 1,000 people and life expectancy was 65.The cuisine of Tuvalu is based on the staple of pulaka, taro, breadfruit, bananas and coconut and the many species of fish found in the ocean and lagoons of the atolls. The Tuvaluans benefited from the canned food supplied by the American forces during the Second World War, although the change in diet continued after the war, which resulted in long-term impacts on health. Tuvaluans adopted a diet that includes high levels of corned beef, rice and sugar, consumed even when fish and traditional vegetables are available. The change of diet to include more processed foods is believed to contribute to increasing levels of diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases among Tuvaluans.


== Medical problems in Tuvalu ==
In the 19th and 20th century, after the beginning of commerce with Europe and the United States, the primary medical problem in the islands was tuberculosis. Tuberculosis has  declined from an average 36 cases per year to 19 per year from 1975 to 2009.  In 2016 the incidence of tuberculosis was reported as continuing to decline with average of 15 new cases of sputum positive infections every year.Since the late 20th century the biggest health problem in Tuvalu, and the leading cause of death, has been heart disease, which is closely followed by diabetes and high blood pressure. In 2016 the majority of deaths resulted from cardiac diseases, with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and cerebral-vascular disease among the other causes of death.In 2014, the World Health Organization confirmed an outbreak of dengue fever in Tuvalu. The illness has re emerged in several Pacific Island countries after a period of twenty years. A further outbreak of dengue fever occurred in 2019, from 25 March to 5 July 496 suspected and 226 confirmed cases were reported. 54 cases required hospitalisation from which 2 children died.


== Healthcare ==
The Princess Margaret Hospital on Funafuti is the only hospital in Tuvalu  and the primary provider of medical services. The Tuvaluan medical staff at the hospital in 2011 comprised the Director of Health & Surgeon, the Chief Medical Officer Public Health, an anaesthetist, a paediatric medical officer and an obstetrics and gynaecology medical officer. Allied health staff include two radiographers, two pharmacists, three laboratory technicians, two dieticians and 13 nurses with specialised training in fields including surgical nursing, anaesthesia nursing/ICU, paediatric nursing and midwifery. It also employs a dentist. The Department of Health also employs nine or ten nurses on the outer islands to provide general nursing and midwifery services.


== Non-government organizations ==
There are no private formal medical services available in Tuvalu.
Non-government organizations provide health services, such as the Tuvalu Red Cross Society; Fusi Alofa (the care and rehabilitation of disabled children); the Tuvalu Family Health Association (training and support on sexual and reproductive health); and the Tuvalu Diabetics Association (training and support on diabetes).

Des Walker,"Desmond Sinclair Walker (born 26 November 1965) is an English football coach and former player who played as a defender.
At club level he played in seven cup finals for Nottingham Forest at Wembley, winning five of them. He was Forest's player of the year three times. On four straight occasions at Forest he was selected for the PFA Team of the Year. At Sheffield Wednesday he picked up another club player of the year accolade. He played in twenty seasons of senior football. All but the last three of those were in the top flight in either England or Italy.
He played 59 times for England, which included the nation's run to the semi-finals of the 1990 FIFA World Cup.


== Club career ==


=== Nottingham Forest ===
Walker was spotted playing locally in London and was signed by Forest in 1980 as an apprentice. He had previously been part of the youth system at Tottenham Hotspur, but was released after a disagreement with their former manager Bill Nicholson where he refused to get a haircut. Known for giving opportunities to youth players, Forest manager Brian Clough, trying to rebuild the side after the break-up of their European Cup-winning team, gave Walker his début in March 1984 at the age of 18. Forest finished third and qualified for the UEFA Cup. In Walker's nine seasons of first team football at Forest, they finished in only three different league positions - third (three times), eighth (four times) and ninth (twice).
In 1987 Walker earned the first of his club player of the year awards at Forest.
Forest won the Football League Centenary Tournament in April 1988 (their first senior trophy since 1981). They finished third in the league in 1988. That form also carried them to the semi-finals of that season's FA Cup with Walker in outstanding form.
Forest won the 1989 Full Members Cup beating Everton 4–3 in the final after extra time. They won a second cup that season, the League Cup with a 3–1 victory at Wembley over Luton Town.
With Forest now chasing a unique cup treble tragedy struck a week after the League Cup triumph. Forest and Liverpool met for the second season in a row in the FA Cup semi-finals. The Hillsborough disaster claimed the lives of 97 Liverpool fans. When the rescheduled game took place Forest struggled as Liverpool won 3–1. Forest finished third in the First Division for a second successive year. However they were unable to compete in the UEFA Cup as English clubs were still banned from European competitions following the Heysel Stadium disaster. Walker was named in the PFA Team of the Year for the first time.
Walker won his second League Cup winner's medal when Forest retained the trophy in 1990 with victory over Oldham Athletic. He earned his second Forest player of the year accolade. He was also selected for the PFA Team of the Year for the second successive season.
Despite English clubs being re-admitted to Europe for the 1990–91 season, places in the competition were initially limited, and 1990 League Cup winners Forest were not included; the only UEFA Cup place that season went to league runners-up Aston Villa. Walker was now aged 25, and despite playing for one of England's most successful clubs, he had not yet been given a chance to prove himself in European competition.
Walker scored an own goal in the 1991 FA Cup Final as Forest lost 2–1 to Tottenham Hotspur. Roy Keane played in central midfield for Forest; years later in his autobiography, Keane admitted he should not have declared himself fit to play as he had not recovered from injury. Yet again Walker missed the chance of playing in Europe. The otherwise excellent consistency of his form earned him a third successive selection for the PFA Team of the Year.
On New Year's Day 1992, Walker scored his only goal in professional football, the equaliser in a 1–1 draw against Luton. That season Forest won the Full Members Cup for a second time beating Southampton 3–2 after extra time. Forest reached another League Cup final but lost to Manchester United. Forest had now played in seven domestic cup finals at Wembley in five seasons, winning five of the finals. Walker signed off from Forest as their player of the year for the third time in six seasons. He also earned a fourth successive selection for the PFA Team of the Year. One other player was selected in the same four PFA Teams of the Year, Walker's teammate Stuart Pearce who earned selection five seasons in a row.


=== Sampdoria ===
After the Euro 1992 finals, Walker was sold for £1.5 million to Italian side Sampdoria, who were coached by Sven-Göran Eriksson at the time. Sampdoria had been runners-up in the 1992 European Cup Final in the season prior to Walker's arrival, however they finished sixth in Serie A, nor did they win the 1992 Coppa Italia; thus they did not take part in any UEFA competitions in Walker's only season with the team. Although much was expected of Walker upon his arrival in Italy, he endured a difficult season, and did not perform well; moreover, Sampdoria finished the season placed seventh in Serie A, failing once again to qualify for European competitions, and also suffered a second–round elimination in the Coppa Italia. Despite playing 30 of Sampdoria's league games, however, he was largely played out of position at full back. He stayed just one season before returning to England.


=== Sheffield Wednesday ===
Walker joined Sheffield Wednesday for £2.7 million in 1993. He made more than 300 appearances for the club under eight different managers in eight years. He quickly became a favourite of the fans earning their player of the year award at the end of his first season. He also picked up the captain's armband. His time at Sheffield Wednesday brought mixed fortunes, although he played in the overwhelming majority of the club's games following his arrival.
In that first season, Wednesday finished seventh in the Premier League, but were defeated in what was effectively their last chance of silverware in February. They suffered a hefty defeat at the hands of Manchester United in the semi-finals of the League Cup. In 1994–95, Wednesday finished in 13th and 15th in 1995–96. Wednesday were never in any acute danger of relegation on either occasion. In the 1995–96 season, Wednesday played four games in the group stage of the Intertoto Cup.
The 1996–97 season began brilliantly for Wednesday topping the Premier League at the end of August. However they were unable to keep up their excellent form. They finished the season in seventh as they had three seasons before. They also had the best FA Cup run in Walker's time their reaching the last eight. In the next two seasons Wednesday finished 16th and 12th respectively in the top division.
They were then relegated in 1999–2000. Walker played in seven seasons of top-tier football with Wednesday to add to his nine at Forest and one with Sampdoria. In a disappointing 2000–01 season in the 24-team second tier Wednesday finished 17th. Amid Sheffield Wednesday's growing financial strain associated with their fall from the top league, Walker was released from his contract in 2001.
In 2007, he came out top alongside Peter Swan in a poll to find Sheffield Wednesday's two greatest ever centre backs on the website Vital Football.


=== Return to Forest ===
He briefly trained with his ex-Forest teammate Nigel Clough at Burton Albion (where he was manager) and a short stint in the US playing for the MetroStars in their 9/11 benefit matches against D.C. United. Forest manager, Paul Hart then asked if Walker could train with Forest, who were now struggling in the second tier of English football. In July 2002, Walker signed for Forest on a permanent basis.Walker made almost 60 more appearances in his second spell for Forest, and left the club at the age of 38 with a total of 354 appearances and one goal. His final competitive appearance for Forest came against Wigan Athletic on 7 August 2004.On 16 May 2005, a testimonial match was held in his honour – this drew 13,886 spectators with guest appearances from Stuart Pearce, Ian Wright, Emile Heskey and Nigel Clough. Controversy was caused when the player was arrested several hours later for being drunk and disorderly. He became first team coach at Forest afterwards but left in January 2005 when Gary Megson was appointed as manager.


== International career ==
Walker made his international debut as a substitute for Tony Adams in a game against Denmark in 1988. It was not long before Walker was a regular starter in the side against competition from Adams, Terry Butcher and Mark Wright.


=== 1990 World Cup ===
At the 1990 FIFA World Cup, Walker started all seven of the games in which England would play, gaining international acclaim. Playing in a three-man defence alongside Wright and Butcher, Walker shrugged off knocks and fatigue to enjoy a superb tournament, which ended when England were knocked out in a penalty shootout by West Germany in the semi-finals. Rob Bagchi, writing for The Guardian in 2010, praised his performances, arguing that Walker's ""speed, anticipation and mastery of the fair tackle were reminiscent of Bobby Moore.""


=== Euro 1992 ===
Walker subsequently became England's defensive lynchpin after Butcher's retirement, continuing to feature regularly after Graham Taylor had taken over as manager. As an almost ever-present during a period when England played a relatively large number of internationals, Walker became the fastest player in history to reach 50 caps, a feat he accomplished in just over four years from 53 internationals played by England.
Walker travelled with the England squad to the 1992 UEFA European Football Championship in Sweden but England failed to progress beyond the group stages. Walker's trademark excellent defending made him one of the few bright spots of the England performance.


=== World Cup 1994 qualification ===
On 28 April 1993, in a 1994 World Cup qualifier, England were leading 2–1 against the Netherlands. With four minutes remaining the exceptionally-paced Marc Overmars became the first person in Walker's then 52 internationals to beat the defender for speed. With little choice, Walker fouled Overmars. Peter van Vossen scored the resulting penalty and the game ended 2–2.A month later on 29 May in Chorzow, Walker was again beaten in a foot race. Poland's Dariusz Adamczuk got to the ball first and with one touch lobbed Chris Woods to score.
Four days later, on 2 June 1993, England's hopes of qualifying were dealt a further blow during a 2–0 loss away to Norway. Walker's defensive authority was compromised by Taylor's imposition of an untested wing back system. Walker was largely at fault for the first goal. After committing a foul near the corner flag Walker began to argue with the referee. He was caught out with a quick free kick leading to a cross for Øyvind Leonhardsen to score.Walker played in a three-game Summer tour of the host nation of the following year's finals, USA. He then missed other crucial qualifiers, a 3–0 win over Poland and a decisive 2–0 loss against the Netherlands in Rotterdam. Walker played in England's last qualifier in the group in November 1993. San Marino scored the fastest ever goal in a World Cup qualifier, after just eight seconds, capitalising on an under hit backpass from Stuart Pearce. England won 7–1 but failed to qualify (they had needed to win by seven clear goals and hope that the Netherlands lost in Poland, but the Netherlands won 3–1 so England's result was academic). This was Taylor's last match in charge of England, and although he was a member of Taylors successor (Terry Venables) early squads, he never played for the national team again.In total, Walker made 59 appearances for England, scoring no goals.


== Playing style ==
Described as a ""stopper,"" Walker was a pacey and hard-tackling central defender, with a good physique and excellent anticipation, who was regarded for the consistently high quality of his defending through the first half of his playing career. Defensively he was among the best markers and timers of the tackle of the television era in English football. His speed allowed him to repeatedly recover difficult situations for his teams. Gary Lineker named Walker in the best One to Eleven that Lineker played beside during his career. Lineker said of him, ""Des wasn't the greatest footballer in the world but he was unbelievably quick and had a brilliant defensive mind. Brian Clough used to stick him on me when we played – he always put him man-to-man which was quite unusual in those days – and he used to sing that song 'You'll never beat Des Walker!' – he used to drive you mad when you were playing against him!""At set pieces for his teams, Walker would stay back to provide defensive cover rather than supplement the attack, reflected in the fact that he only scored once in around 800 senior games.
He played in 20 seasons of senior football, with all but the last three of those in the top flight..He played in seven cup finals with Nottingham Forest at Wembley, winning five. Perhaps a more useful indication of the consistency of his excellence are the individual accolades he collected when at his peak: in the last six seasons of his first spell at Forest he was Player of the Year three times, in the last four of those seasons he was selected for the PFA Team of the Year each time, on his return from his season in Italy he was Sheffield Wednesday's player of the year in his first season there, and following his full international debut in 1988 he became the quickest player to collect 50 full England caps, taking just over four years to do so.
Walker rarely missed matches. He incurred a remarkably low number of bookings during the first 10 years of his career, despite often dispossessing opponents with sliding challenges from all directions. While not being the tallest centre-back he could leap to beat the tallest forwards in the air, and his pace meant even the quickest and most skilful forwards very rarely beat him.

Carl Torbush,"Carl William Torbush Jr. (October 11, 1951 – November 5, 2023) was an American American football and baseball coach. He served as the head football coach at Louisiana Tech University in 1987, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1997 to 2000, and East Tennessee State University (ETSU) from 2013 to 2017, compiling a career college football record of 31–48. Outside of football, Torbush was the head baseball coach at Southeastern Louisiana University from 1977 to 1979, tallying a mark of 75–58. Torbush retired from coaching in December 2017.


== Early life ==
Born in East Spencer, North Carolina, Torbush relocated with his family to Knoxville, Tennessee, at age 11. He attended Austin-East High School in Knoxville, where he played in multiple sports. He received athletic scholarship offers from various Division I schools, but decided to walk-on at the University of Tennessee. After having no playing time as a freshman, he transferred to Carson-Newman College in Jefferson City. As a senior at Carson-Newman, he received first-team NAIA All-American honors in both baseball and football. Torbush graduated from Carson-Newman in 1974.After college, Torbush coached briefly at Carter High School in Knoxville. In February 1975, he signed with the Kansas City Royals. Following his one-season professional baseball career, he went to Baylor University to begin his collegiate coaching career. He received his master's degree in physical education and health from Baylor in 1976.


== Assistant coaching ==
Torbush began his career as an assistant coach for the Baylor Bears, and later coached for the Southeastern Louisiana Lions, the Ole Miss Rebels, the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs, the Alabama Crimson Tide (where he was the defensive coordinator under Dennis Franchione from 2001 to 2002), Texas A&M Aggies, and the Carson-Newman Eagles.
Torbush was part of some mild success at Ole Miss, where he was defensive coordinator from 1983 to 1986. The 1986 season saw Ole Miss compile an 8–3–1 record including a season-ending 20–17 win at the Independence Bowl over Texas Tech. The 1986 Rebel defense allowed opponents an average of less than 13 points per game and statistically ranked as the best defense in the Southeastern Conference. It was after that 1986 season that Torbush was hired away to become head coach at Louisiana Tech.
Torbush stepped down as defensive coordinator at the University of Kansas on May 31, 2011, due to low grade prostate cancer. He was set to begin his second season in this role. In January 2012, Torbush was introduced as the linebackers coach with Liberty University.

Under Torbush, the team recorded a 3–8 season in 1987 highlighted by the defense and a win over Kansas.


=== North Carolina ===
After only one year as head coach at Louisiana Tech, Torbush joined the UNC coaching staff in 1988 as defensive coordinator and linebackers coach. He was the only member of Mack Brown's original coaching staff to stay throughout Brown's 10-year tenure. He recruited and coached many defensive standouts; his 1995, 1996 and 1997 units led the nation in total defense three years in a row and were often regarded as the best in the country. Torbush was a 1997 finalist for the Broyles Award, given annually to the nation's top assistant coach. During his time at UNC, at least one of his linebackers went pro every year. Among his more notable players were Julius Peppers, Brian Simmons, Greg Ellis, and Dré Bly.
After the 1997 season, Brown announced he was moving to the University of Texas at Austin. He left the team immediately, and Torbush was named to replace him. He coached the team in the 1998 Gator Bowl, capping off one of the Tar Heels' best seasons ever. The Tar Heels finished with an 11–1 record, only the third 11-win season in school history. They also finished sixth in the AP Poll and fourth in the coaches' poll—their highest ranking in the major media polls in half a century. North Carolina credits the 1997 regular season to Brown and that Gator Bowl to Torbush.
Despite the loss of most of the team's defensive stars of the last three years, the Tar Heels were expected to pick up right where they left off in 1998. However, they never really recovered from an unexpected loss to Miami (Ohio) to open the 1998 season, in which they barely managed to qualify for the Las Vegas Bowl. The next year was an unmitigated disaster. The team was riddled with injuries, the most devastating one occurring when quarterback Ronald Curry tore his Achilles tendon. The Tar Heels were so thin at quarterback that they were forced to convert safety Antwon Black to quarterback, but he was lost after two games to mononucleosis. After starting the season 1–1, the Tar Heels didn't win another game until beating NC State in November. They finished 3–8—UNC's first losing season since Brown's two consecutive 1–10 seasons in 1988 and 1989. School officials actually planned to fire him after the season, but an outpouring of support from players and fans led to a change of heart. He was, however, forced to fire several members of his staff, including offensive coordinator Steve Marshall, who had been criticized for being too conservative in his play calling.
The Tar Heels rebounded to finish 6–5 in 2000, although Torbush was fired at the end of the season.


=== East Tennessee State ===
Torbush established the newly restarted program at East Tennessee State, which had last played in the 2003 season. The Buccaneers signed their first class in 2014, redshirting all players, and began a year of practice in preparation for the 2015 season, when the team competed as an NCAA Division I FCS independent. In the 2016 season they joined the Southern Conference. On December 8, 2017, Torbush announced his retirement from coaching. In his time as ETSU head coach, he had an overall record of 11–22 record with 4–12 mark in SoCon play. Overall, he finished with a 31–48 career head coaching record.


== Illness and death ==
In May 2011, Torbush was diagnosed with prostate cancer, and underwent surgery to treat it. He made a recovery and later returned to coaching. In 2023, Torbush was diagnosed with ALS. He died on November 5, 2023, at the age of 72.

David Ramsay (trader),"David Ramsay (c. 1740 – c. 1810) was a controversial figure born in Leven, Scotland, who served as a cabin boy in the British Royal Navy, participated in the siege of Louisbourg in 1758 and later acted as a courier, translator and fur and alcohol trader, in part of the lower Great Lakes region consisting of present-day southern Ontario, Canada, and western New York state.
Several conflicting images emerge of Ramsay regarding his conduct amongst the native people of the region while engaged as a trader. One cluster of accounts preserved in the 18th and 19th century oral tradition of Loyalist settlers in the area around Long Point, Ontario, draws mostly on stories told by the wife of local settler Frederick Mabee in the early 19th century and portray Ramsay as a quintessential ""pioneer hero"" figure who strikes out at local natives only in preservation of his life and property, against the onslaught of the local Ojibwa people who sought to harm him without cause.
Another perspective, derived from native oral accounts in the early 19th century by missionary Peter Jones, present a decidedly different version of Ramsay's activities in Upper Canada. This latter version is also more in keeping with Ramsay's own legal declaration on May 15, 1772, at Fort Niagara, after he surrendered himself to British colonial legal authorities.
In this account, Ramsay confessed that in March 1772, on the banks of Kettle Creek north of the present day community of Port Stanley, Ontario, ""in defense of his life"", he had killed an Ojibwa man named Wandagan, as well as two women who were also present while other natives were absent from the camp. Ramsay also admitted that he had scalped all three adult individuals involved and also kidnapped two local children who were in the company of the natives, one aged twelve, removing them to the Long Point area.
The following month he claimed to have been approached by local Ojibwas in the vicinity of Long Point, and after lying to them regarding the origin of the children, who he claimed were ""English"", was taken prisoner, tied up, and placed by the fire. Ramsay stated in his declaration that he then managed to release his bonds, and proceeded to kill four adult natives and a child before making an escape. In all cases Ramsay maintained that he had acted in defense of his life and property and that he had initially been accosted by the Ojibwa on Kettle Creek when he had refused them a share in his cache of trade alcohol.
British colonial Superintendent of Indian Affairs at the time, Sir William Johnson, who had read Ramsay's declaration and conferred with local native informants, believed that Ramsay's actions were not in self-defense, but rather constituted homicide and concluded that the murders and scalpings were ""inexcusable and the circumstances of his being able to do all this, is an evident proof that he was not in the danger he represents and that the Indians were too much in the liquor to execute any bad purpose."" Ramsay's actions, in particular his scalping of his victims which according to Ojibwa custom constituted an act of war, precipitated a crisis in relations between British colonial authorities and the regional native population. Johnson attributed the killings to the ""private act of a villain"", not official British policy, and achieved an 
at least temporary resolution to the situation, by distributing a 
shipment of gifts to native leaders in the area. Johnson also ordered the recall of all regional traders to local military posts until further notice and called for a redistribution of British troops in the region in the face of potential open conflict. He further ordered the transfer of the prisoner Ramsay to Montreal for a criminal trial. Johnson stated that he believed that Ramsay deserved ""capital punishment"" for his actions, but believed that a fair trial was unobtainable under the circumstances and personally did not ""think that [Ramsay] will suffer, had he killed a hundred."" Johnson's prediction held true and despite Ramsay allegedly bragging about the killings while under guard in Montreal and indicating that he would repeat his actions upon release, received no punishment, at least partly due to the prosecution providing no native witnesses.
There is some evidence to suggest that Ramsay, later in life, modified his attitude toward native people and is known to have acted on their behalf in several matters pertaining to issues between them and the colonial government. Almost nothing is known about Ramsay in later life, apart from his possession of a large tract of land in Upper Canada and his ownership of a trading ship in the port of New York. Ramsay disappears from the historical record circa 1810.


== David Ramsay In local legend ==
A number of regional legends, traceable to stories told by white settlers in the mid to late 19th century in southern Ontario, have arisen surrounding the figure of David Ramsay. In one such tale, Ramsay is presented as a fur-trader who manages to evade natives along the north shore of Lake Erie with a boat loaded with gold, which he purportedly buries in a ridge at Long Point, planning to dig it up when the natives were no longer a problem.
According to the tale, Ramsay died before retrieving it, forgot all about his cache, or most likely forgot exactly where it was buried. A deacon named John Troyer learned of the legend, and reputedly using divination, acquired knowledge of its exact location. Troyer purportedly invited an 11- or 12-year-old boy, Simpson McCall, to help him claim the treasure. McCall's parents refused, fearing the Deacon's reputation. In one version of the tale excerpted from the Niagara Falls Evening Review of October 19, 1922, Troyer and the boy, in this variant referred to as his ""son"", go in quest of the treasure:
""They went to Long Point, arriving just enough before dark to locate the spot where the treasure was. Then they waited until exactly midnight, and then started a procession, Deacon Troyer holding the open Bible before him, and his son following with a lighted candle, with spades, picks, etc. They dug down, and presently the pick struck metal. They got the pick under the lid of the box and pried it up. And then, at that moment a black shape rose up and assumed the form of a black dog, growing bigger and bigger, and they dropped the Bible and candle and rushed for the canoe, and never had any curiosity to return to the spot.""
This failed reclaiming story was purportedly told by Troyer to McCall, and McCall to J. H. Coyne, who made it public in an address at an Ontario Historical Society meeting in Norfolk County. This meeting was reported a few days later in the Niagara Falls Evening Review.

WNT4,"WNT4 is a secreted protein that, in humans, is encoded by the WNT4 gene, found on chromosome 1. It promotes female sex development and represses male sex development.  Loss of function may have consequences, such as female to male sex reversal.


== Function ==
The WNT gene family consists of structurally related genes that encode secreted signaling proteins. These proteins have been implicated in oncogenesis and in several developmental processes, including regulation of cell fate and embryogenesis.


=== Pregnancy ===
WNT4 is involved in many features of pregnancy as a downstream target of BMP2.  For example, it regulates endometrial stromal cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation.  These processes are all necessary for the development of an embryo.  Ablation in female mice results in subfertility, with defects in implantation and decidualization.  For instance, there is a decrease in responsiveness to progesterone signaling.  Furthermore, postnatal uterine differentiation is characterized by a reduction in gland numbers and the stratification of the luminal epithelium.


=== Sexual  development ===


==== Early gonads ====
Gonads arise from the thickening of coelomic epithelium, which at first appears as multiple cell layers.  They later commit to sex determination, becoming either female or male under normal circumstances.  Regardless of sex, though, WNT4 is needed for cell proliferation.  In mouse gonads, it has been detected only eleven days after fertilization.  If deficient in XY mice, there is a delay in Sertoli cell differentiation.  Moreover, there is delay in sex cord formation.  These issues are usually compensated for at birth.WNT4 also interacts with RSPO1 early in development.  If both are deficient in XY mice, the outcome is less expression of SRY and downstream targets.  Furthermore, the amount of SOX9 is reduced and defects in vascularization are found.  These occurrences result in testicular hypoplasia.  Male to female sex reversal, however, does not occur because Leydig cells remain normal.  They are maintained by steroidogenic cells, now unrepressed.


==== Ovaries ====
WNT4 is required for female sex development.  Upon secretion it binds to Frizzled receptors, activating a number of molecular pathways.  One important example is the stabilization of β catenin, which increases the expression of target genes. For instance, TAFIIs 105 is now encoded, a subunit of the TATA binding protein for RNA polymerase in ovarian follicle cells.  Without it, female mice have small ovaries with less mature follicles.  In addition, the production of SOX9 is blocked.  In humans, WNT4 also suppresses 5-α reductase activity, which converts testosterone into dihydrotestosterone.  External male genitalia are therefore not formed.  Moreover, it contributes to the formation of the Müllerian duct, a precursor to female reproductive organs.


==== Male sexual development ====
The absence of WNT4 is required for male sex development.  FGF signaling suppresses WNT4, acting in a feed forward loop triggered by SOX9.  If this signaling is deficient in XY mice, female genes are unrepressed.  With no FGFR2, there is a partial sex reversal.  With no FGF9, there is a full sex reversal.  Both cases are rescued, though, by a WNT4 deletion.  In these double mutants, the resulting somatic cells are normal.


=== Kidneys ===
WNT4 is essential for nephrogenesis.  It regulates kidney tubule induction and the mesenchymal to epithelial transformation in the cortical region.  In addition, it influences the fate of the medullary stroma during development.  Without it, smooth muscle α actin is markedly reduced.  This occurrence causes pericyte deficiency around the vessels, leading to a defect in maturation. WNT4 probably functions by activating BMP4, a known smooth muscle differentiation factor.


=== Muscles ===
WNT4 contributes to the formation of the neuromuscular junction in vertebrates.  Expression is high during the creation of first synaptic contacts, but subsequently downregulated.  Moreover, loss of function causes a 35 percent decrease in the number of acetylcholine receptors.  Overexpression, however, causes an increase.  These events alter fiber type composition with the production of more slow fibers.  Lastly, MuSK is the receptor for WNT4, activated through tyrosine phosphorylation.  It contains a CRD domain similar to Frizzled receptors.


=== Lungs ===
WNT4 is also associated with lung formation and has a role in the formation of the respiratory system. When WNT4 is knocked out, there are many problems that occur in lung development. It has been shown that when WNT4 is knocked out, the lung buds formed are reduced in size and proliferation has greatly diminished which cause underdeveloped or incomplete development of the lungs. It also causes tracheal abnormalities because it affects the tracheal cartilage ring formation. Lastly, the absence of WNT4 also affects the expression of other genes that function in lung development such as Sox9 and FGF9.


== Clinical significance ==


=== Deficiency ===

Several mutations are known to cause loss of function in WNT4. One example is a heterozygous C to T transition in exon 2.  This causes an arginine to cysteine substitution at amino acid position 83, a conserved location.  The formation of illegitimate sulfide bonds creates a misfolded protein, resulting in loss of function.  In XX humans, WNT4 now cannot stabilize β-catenin.  Furthermore, steroidogenic enzymes like CYP17A1 and HSD3B2 are not suppressed, leading to an increase in testosterone production.  Along with this androgen excess, patients have no uteruses.  Other Müllerian abnormalities, however, are not found.  This disorder is therefore distinct from classic Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome.


=== SERKAL syndrome ===
A disruption of WNT4 synthesis in XX humans produces SERKAL syndrome. The genetic mutation is a homozygous C to T transition at cDNA position 341.  This causes an alanine to valine residue substitution at amino acid position 114, a location highly conserved in all organisms, including zebrafish and Drosophila.  The result is loss of function, which affects mRNA stability.  Ultimately it causes female to male sex reversal.


=== Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser Syndrome ===
WNT4 has been clearly implicated in the atypical version of Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser Syndromefound in XX humans.  A genetic mutation causes a leucine to proline residue substitution at amino acid position 12.  This occurrence reduces the intranuclear levels of β-catenin.  In addition, it removes the inhibition of steroidogenic enzymes like 3β-hydroxysteriod dehydrogenase and 17α-hydroxylase.  Patients usually have uterine hypoplasia, which is associated with biological symptoms of androgen excess.  Furthermore, Müllerian abnormalities are often found.

Greenland Representation to the European Union,"The Representation of Greenland in Brussels is the official representative office of Greenland to the European Union. The Representation of Greenland to the EU was established in 1992 in connection to the Royal Danish Embassy in Belgium. Greenland Representation is located together with The Royal Danish Embassy, and the Mission of the Faroes to the European Union.
As the Government of Greenland delegate, the Minister Counsellor is credentialed to Belgium and maintains The Government of Greenland relations with the EU institutions.


== Greenland Treaty ==

A referendum was held in 1982 and a sparse majority voted in favour of withdrawal from the European Community. Between 1982 and 1984 the terms were negotiated and on February 1, 1985, Greenland formally withdrew. A Treaty on Greenland's withdrawal from the Community was made – the Greenland Treaty – declaring Greenland as a “special case”.
This ""special case"" provided a fisheries agreement between the parties in which the European Community and later the European Union kept its fishing rights and Greenland kept its financial contribution as before the withdrawal. It also gave Greenland tariff free access of fisheries products to the EU as long as there exists a satisfactory fisheries agreement. Greenland is furthermore associated with the EU through its placement in the Overseas Country and Territories Association Decision.


== The Partnership Agreement 2014–2020 ==
Focus in the Joint Declaration of the Partnership Agreement is the objective to further strengthen the relations and cooperation between the EU and Greenland on different areas ranging from research, sustainable development over industry and education and training and in a long-term perspective.
The focal sector of the Partnership Agreement period 2014-2020 is education and training. In order to develop this specific sector with regards to a sustainable human development in an era of globalisation.
It is reflected in the Partnership Agreement that the relationship between Greenland and the EU is mutually beneficial. Furthermore, the overall goal is to diversify Greenland's economy.

Xerox 820,"The Xerox 820 Information Processor is an 8-bit desktop computer sold by Xerox in the early 1980s. The computer runs under the CP/M operating system and uses floppy disk drives for mass storage. The microprocessor board is a licensed variant of the Big Board computer.


== 820 ==
Xerox introduced the 820 in June 1981 for $2,995 with two 5+1⁄4-inch single-density disk drives with 81K of capacity per diskette, or $3,795 with two 8-inch drives with 241K capacity. To beat the IBM PC to market, Xerox created little of the computer's design; it is based on the Ferguson Big Board computer kit and other off-the-shelf components, including a Zilog Z80 processor clocked at 2.5 MHz, and 64 KB of RAM.Xerox chose CP/M as its operating system because of the large software library—The 820 is compatible with all Big Board software—and sold a customized version of WordStar for $495, although by 1982 the company offered the standard version for the same price.By 1984, surplus 820 mainboards were available from Xerox for about $50 each, and one of these could be combined with other surplus components to build a working system for a few hundred dollars.


== 820-II ==


=== Overview ===
The Xerox 820-II followed in 1982, featuring a Z80A processor clocked at 4.0 MHz. Pricing started at US$3,000 (equivalent to $9,100 in 2022).Hardware: The processor board is located inside the CRT unit, and includes the Z80A, 64 KB of RAM and a boot ROM which enables booting from any of the supported external drives in 8-bit mode.
Screen: The display is a 24-line, 80-character (7×10 dot matrix) white-on-black monochrome CRT, with software-selectable variations such as reverse video, blinking, low-intensity (equivalent to grey text), and 4×4-resolution graphics.Communication ports: These include two 25-pin RS-232 serial ports (including one intended for a Xerox 620 or 630 printer or compatible, and one intended for a modem), and two optional parallel ports which can be added via an internal pin header, usable with a Xerox or other cable.
Keyboard: A bulky 96-character ASCII keyboard with a 10-key numeric keypad and a cursor diamond which otherwise defaults to Ctrl-A to Ctrl-D. It also includes HELP and LINE FEED keys, and is attached to the back of the CRT unit by a thick cable.Software: A typical 820-II comes with CP/M 2.2, diagnostic software, WordStar, and Microsoft's BASIC-80 programming language.


=== Expansion ===
The Xerox 820-II is different from the 820:

the 820 mainboard has a floppy disk controller (Western Digital FD1771) but no hard disk controller or any expansion bay capabilities, whereas
the 820-II mainboard has no built-in disk controller nor a built-in processor expansion capability (these are required to be on expansion bay cards; there are two different expansion bay connectors, one which accommodates one of several disk I/O boards, and one which accommodates a processor board—the processor board was the taller of the two).The Xerox 820-II's disk I/O capability is on one of two different cards:

a floppy disk I/O card, which can control external 8"" or 5.25"" floppies, or a mixture of these, as configured by special external cables, and
a SCSI hard disk/floppy disk I/O card, which can control one external 8"" hard drive and one to three external 8"" floppy drives (these being either single- or double-sided, and either single- or double-density).The 820-II has a processor expansion capability, which optionally supports a 16-bit Intel 8086 processor card with its own 128 KB or 256 KB of RAM (the 16-bit processor card uses the on-mainboard Z80A for all peripheral I/O operations, therefore the 8086 behaves more like a co-processor).
The 820-II's 16-bit processor card features a true 16-bit 8086 processor, not an 8/16-bit 8088 processor as on the contemporary IBM PC.
The 16-bit processor card is, however, limited to 128 KB of DRAM (256 KB, maximum, if incorporating a rather rare RAM ""daughter"" card).
Flipping the 820-II's console between 8-bit and 16-bit modes on an 820-II which is equipped with the optional 16-bit processor card is accomplished by a keyboard control command.
Xerox 820-II component parts were available from Xerox outlet stores at quite reasonable prices, and it was not uncommon to convert surplus (but new) 128 KB 16-bit processor cards to 512 KB by the substitution of sixteen 41256 DRAM chips for the card's usual sixteen 4164 DRAM chips (both are 16-pin DIPs—pin 1 is unused on a 4164 and becomes A8 on a 41256), plus the addition of two ICs (one 74F02 and one 74F08, or two user-modified PALs) for controlling the 41256's 9th address row and column (not found on 4164s), thereby achieving a four-times increase in RAM without the use of a ""daughter"" card (which can only achieve a two-times increase in RAM).
A simple modification to the 820-II's BIOS initialization code was developed to move the BIOS image up to the top of the 512 KB RAM area, thereby giving the applications maximum contiguous RAM. Otherwise, the 512 KB of the converted processor card is segmented into a lower 128 KB segment, and an upper 384 KB segment, but CP/M-86 was designed to handle such segmented RAM, so this BIOS modification is optional, although desirable.
Unlike much later processors from Intel, and others, which offers both segmented and ""flat"" addressing, the 8086 (and the 8088) offers only segmented addressing, with each segment limited to 64 KB. By effective utilization of the four available segment registers, Code, Data, Stack and Extra, the 512 KB address space possible with the modified 820-II 8086 processor card can be very effectively managed, although in 64 KB chunks. If each data area is identified with its segment and its offset, possibly starting with zero offset, then there is little penalty associated with such segmented addressing, just as long as each individual data area does not exceed 64 KB, and most such data areas were intentionally designed so as not to exceed 64 KB.


=== Disk storage ===
Much CP/M software uses the Xerox 820's disk format, and other computers such as the Kaypro II are compatible with it. The CRT unit contains the processor, and a large port on the back connected via heavy cable to a disk drive, allowing a wide variety of configurations. Disk drives can be daisy-chained via a port on the back.

Reference: 820-II Operation Manual


=== The Basic Operating System (BOS) monitor ===
The system can function to a limited extent without having to load a disk operating system: the system monitor in ROM allows, at boot-up, a variety of uses via one-letter commands followed by attributes.
A user normally uses the ""(L)oad"" command to load a bootstrap loader (i.e., for CP/M) from a floppy or the fixed disk. One can also access a ""(T)ypewriter"" mode for direct interface with the serial printer port and basic typing on screen. ""(H)ost terminal"" allows the 820-II to interface as a terminal via either of the serial ports, as specified, at up to 19.2 kbit/s.
For low-end system operations, a user can manually read or write to memory, execute code at a particular location in memory, read from or write to the system ports, or even read a sector from a disk. Further, (documented) calls to BOS subroutines allows a skilled user or program to restart the system, perform disk operations, take keyboard input, or write to the display.

== Model 16/8 ==
The Model 16/8, introduced in May 1983, has dual CPUs, an 8-bit Z80 and 16-bit Intel 8086, which can be booted jointly or separately. The operating system is 8-bit CP/M-80 and 16-bit CP/M-86, and the computer was supplied with the WordStar word processor and dBase II database management system. It has double 8"" floppy disk drives, a 12"" monochrome monitor and a daisywheel printer. Later in 1984 double 5.25"" floppy disk drives, a portrait-size blue monitor, and a laser printer were offered.  The Model 16/8 is also called a Xerox 823.
Flipping the 8/16's console between 8 bit and 16 bit modes is accomplished by a simple keyboard control command.


== Reception ==
The 820 was codenamed The Worm because Xerox saw Apple Computer as its main competitor; InfoWorld reported that Apple delayed and redesigned a computer under development to better compete with the 820. While less expensive than dedicated word processors such as the Xerox 860, the 820 was expensive and slow compared to personal computers; one month after its release, the $1,795 Osborne 1—faster, portable, and with bundled software worth more than $1,000—appeared, while Xerox charged $200 for the required CP/M software. The 820 did not use Xerox PARC's sophisticated technology that influenced the Apple Macintosh.InfoWorld in 1982 stated that ""The considerable virtues of the Xerox 820 lie mostly in its use of the Big Board design—its faults are, to a large extent, Xerox's own, and in no small measure due to its rush to get the system to market"" before the IBM PC. The reviewer criticized the keyboard's contact bounce, slow disk access, and ""pieced-together ... minimal"" documentation, and warned customers against the Xerox-customized WordStar. He reported that three of the four computers' disk-drive units his company had purchased had problems, and ""strongly recommend an 820 owner get a service contract"". The reviewer concluded that while the 820 ""could be a fine office computer, its faults are so egregious that they indicate a basic lack of attention to detail on the part of Xerox"". While noting the 8"" model's low price and Xerox's strong field service and ""prestige nameplate"", and expressing hope that the company ""gets it act together"" and fix the keyboard and other problems, he suggested that potential customers consider building a similar computer at a lower price around the Big Board.Xerox was the second Fortune 500 company after Tandy Corporation, and first major American office-technology company, to sell a personal computer. It had experience with large customers, unlike Apple or Tandy. InfoWorld's reviewer stated that he and his colleagues were glad when Xerox announced the 820, because ""at last a recognized business-equipment manufacturer had brought out a standard CP/M"" computer at a low price; dealers reportedly were also pleased to sell a computer from a well-known company. The Rosen Electronics Letter also unfavorably reviewed the 820 in June 1981, however, describing it as a disappointing, ""me too"" product for a leading technology company like Xerox. In November it stated that the new IBM PC was much more attractive; ""we think the bulk of the sales will go to IBM"". They did choose the PC, introduced one month after the 820; Yankee Group said after the latter's discontinuation that it ""sort of got blown away right then and there by the IBM announcement"". Xerox hoped to sell 100,000 820s in two years, but reportedly failed to do so in four; Micro Cornucopia reported in October 1983 that a dealer had thousands of 820 motherboards for sale for $39.95. Xerox discontinued the 16/8 and 820-II in early 1985; InfoWorld's article stated that ""few will notice [their] demise"". Yankee Group predicted that the company would introduce its own PC clone.

Sébastien Loeb,"Sébastien Loeb (French pronunciation: [sebastjɛ̃ lœb]; born 26 February 1974) is a French professional rally, racing and rallycross driver. He is the most successful driver in the World Rally Championship (WRC), having won the world championship a record nine times in a row. He holds several other WRC records, including most event wins, most podium finishes and most stage wins. Loeb retired from full time WRC participation at the end of 2012. He currently drives part time in the WRC for M-Sport Ford World Rally Team, and full time in the World Rally-Raid Championship (W2RC) for Bahrain Raid Xtreme.Originally a gymnast, Loeb was a four time Champion of Alsace and one time champion of the French Grand East. He switched to rallying in 1995 and won the Junior World Rally Championship in 2001. Signed by the Citroën World Rally Team for the 2002 season, he and co-driver Daniel Elena took their maiden WRC win that same year at the Rallye Deutschland. After finishing runner-up to Petter Solberg by one point in 2003, Loeb took his first drivers' title in 2004. Continuing with Citroën, he went on to take a record ninth consecutive world title in 2012. Loeb is a tarmac expert, having won all but three of the WRC rallies on that surface in which he has participated between 2005 and 2013. In 2018, Loeb won the Spanish round of that year's championship, in a rare entry six years after his retirement as a full-time WRC driver.Loeb made his debut at the Dakar Rally in 2016 and has participated in it every year bar 2020. He has a best finish of second in 2017, 2022 and 2023. Besides his success in rallying, Loeb is a four-time winner at the Race of Champions, after taking home the Henri Toivonen Memorial Trophy and the title ""Champion of Champions"" in 2003, 2005, 2008 and 2022. In 2004, he won the Nations' Cup for France with Jean Alesi. In 2006, he finished second in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Loeb was named the French Sportsman of the Year in 2007 and 2009, and made knight of the Legion of Honour (Légion d'honneur) in 2009. In 2012, he won the rallycross final in his first appearance at X Games XVIII. The same year, Loeb founded his own motorsports team, Sébastien Loeb Racing; which participates in various racing series. The following year, he participated in the FIA GT Series for Loeb Racing and scored four wins and finished fourth overall. In 2014 and 2015 he had a successful stint in the World Touring Car Championship, scoring six wins in total and with a best finish of third overall in both seasons. From 2016 to 2018 he also participated in the FIA World Rallycross Championship, with two wins and a best position of fourth overall.
In 2021 he tested the Ford Puma Rally1 car several times, before joining the M-Sport Ford WRT for a part-time drive in the 2022 WRC season. He took his 80th WRC victory at the 2022 Monte Carlo Rally, barely a week after finishing second at the 2022 Dakar Rally. Loeb later also won the 2022 Extreme E Championship alongside Cristina Gutiérrez; for Lewis Hamilton's Team X44. Loeb has also competed in other motorsports like the GT World Challenge Europe, the Porsche Supercup, the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the Andros Trophy and other racing categories across many disciplines. Loeb is the only racing driver to win an event in four different FIA-affiliated world championships since winning the Andalucía Rally in 2022.


== Career ==


=== Rallying ===


==== Early career ====
Loeb initially competed as a gymnast and became a four-time Alsatian champion, once champion of the French Grand East, and fifth in the French championship. He broke off school in 1992 but resumed taking classes in 1994, aiming at vocational training in electrical engineering. On 12 September 1994, in parallel with his classes, he started working as an electrician at the Socalec company near Haguenau Airport, where he was the oldest apprentice and already noted for his daring/reckless driving style. On this level, he could count on the understanding of his boss, who was himself fascinated by speed and owned a Ferrari Testarossa 512 TR.In 1995, at age 21, he quit his job and classes and definitively turned his attention to racing. In 1998, he started entering events in the French Citroën Saxo Trophy series, winning the title in 1999. Guy Fréquelin, Citroën Sport's team principal, would serve as Loeb's mentor as he entered the Junior World Rally Championship in 2001, becoming the series' first champion by winning five of the six events. The only event he didn't win this year was Rallye Sanremo: for this event, he was elected as a driver for the WRC championship, driving a Citroën Xsara WRC alongside Philippe Bugalski and Jesús Puras. In only his third rally with a World Rally Car, he surprisingly hounded Peugeot tarmac specialist and eventual victor Gilles Panizzi to the finish, and ended up second.


==== 2002–03 ====
The 2002 season was Loeb's first as a WRC driver with the Citroën Total World Rally Team, although the team only participated in seven rounds in the build-up to their full entry the following year. Loeb started the season by provisionally winning the Monte Carlo Rally, after racing under appeal due to a two-minute time penalty incurred by an illegal tyre change during the second day. Citroën considered the penalty too severe but later withdrew the appeal, and Subaru's Tommi Mäkinen then took a record fourth consecutive Monte Carlo win. Loeb later took his maiden victory at the Rallye Deutschland in Germany, edging out Peugeot's Richard Burns.
In 2003, his first full season in the championship, Loeb won three WRC events, Monte Carlo, Germany and Sanremo, before losing to Petter Solberg in the Wales Rally Great Britain, also losing the championship to him by just one point. Loeb was asked by his team not to chase Solberg at all costs so that he didn't jeopardise Citroën's lead in the constructors' championship. Loeb's reputation grew as he defeated his more illustrious teammates – Carlos Sainz and Colin McRae – over the course of the season.


==== 2004 ====
In the 2004 season, Loeb dominated the WRC scene in a similar way to Michael Schumacher's domination of Formula One the same year, by winning six events and taking six runner-up spots to securely give him the drivers' title, 36 points clear of second-placed Solberg. His six WRC victories tied the record for victories in one season with fellow Frenchman Didier Auriol, who won six events in 1992. He was also responsible for Citroën's second manufacturers' title in a row.
Originally known as a tarmac specialist, 2004 was the year Loeb proved himself capable of winning on other surfaces as well. He won the snow-based Swedish Rally, becoming the first non-Nordic to win the event. On gravel, he triumphed in the Cyprus Rally, Rally of Turkey and the Rally Australia. On tarmac, he continued his success in Monte Carlo and Germany.


==== 2005 ====
In 2005, with victory in the ninth round in Argentina, Loeb became the first to win six consecutive rallies, beating Timo Salonen's record of four from 1985. Having already won the season-opening Rallye Automobile Monte Carlo, he also became the first to win seven in a season, beating his (and Didier Auriol's) own record of six wins in a season. Loeb was in a position to clinch the title while leading the Wales Rally Great Britain, but after it was announced that the last two stages of the rally would be abandoned due to the death of Markko Märtin's co-driver Michael Park in an accident on stage 15, Loeb deliberately incurred a two-minute penalty to drop him to third place and avoid retaining his title in such circumstances. He went on to secure the title by finishing second to Peugeot's Marcus Grönholm at the next rally in Japan.
Loeb eventually extended his win record to ten and won the title with a 56-point margin, breaking a 25-year-old record; Walter Röhrl's margin over Hannu Mikkola in 1980 was 54. Loeb set several other records during the season as well. He won all twelve stages in the 2005 Tour de Corse in France, which marked the first time a driver had won every stage of a WRC rally. Loeb's twelve podium and thirteen points-scoring finishes in a row were also new records in the series.


==== 2006 ====
Citroën's parent company, PSA Peugeot Citroën, pulled both manufacturers out of the WRC at the end of 2005, but Citroën planned to return in 2007 with the C4 WRC, and developed the car during 2006. Loeb was closely involved with this as he was guaranteed the leading role in the team at the comeback. In the meantime, a 'gap year' beckoned in the privateer ranks, namely with Citroën-sponsored Kronos Racing entered as the Kronos Total Citroën World Rally Team.
In order to score on the first round in Monte Carlo, Loeb was initially forced to activate the SupeRally rules for retiring competitors, having spun off the road on day one. Although he did manage to fight his way back to second place, it was the first time he had ever been beaten to the finish (namely by fellow double world champion Marcus Grönholm) on these roads in the Xsara WRC. This outcome was mirrored on the following month's Swedish Rally, with Grönholm again the man to whom Loeb was forced to give best, placing the duo in an early runaway 1–2 position in the points standings.

But the Frenchman's bridesmaid status was not to last, and racking up a triumph on the ensuing Rally Mexico – the first of five on the trot that season – propelled him into a championship lead he was never to lose. He tied Carlos Sainz's record number of 26 individual rally victories in August with a fifth consecutive victory in Germany. With his subsequent victory in Japan, the world record of 27 victories and counting eventually became his. His victory in Cyprus put him on the verge of a third consecutive World Rally Championship title.
Shortly after, Loeb broke his right humerus in a mountain-biking accident near his home in Switzerland, causing him to miss the last four rallies of the season (Turkey, Australia, New Zealand and Wales). In spite of this, Loeb had accumulated such a huge point lead before Turkey that Marcus Grönholm's failure to finish third or better in Australia handed Loeb the 2006 championship crown by one point. He received the news at home via an Internet video link to the rally HQ. Due to the time difference, he made do with early morning coffee instead of the customary champagne, calling the whole experience ""strange"".
In 2022 on the WRC Backstories Podcast with Becs Williams, Loeb revealed that he even considered to co-drive for Colin McRae for the rest of the season due to the injury. As co-drivers themselves scored points, Loeb could have possibly scored points for himself as a driver to try and win the title. The plan never came to fruition though as Grönholm's crash meant Loeb won the title anyway.


==== 2007 ====
For 2007, Loeb returned as an official Citroën driver, with the new Citroën C4 WRC. He won the 75ème Rallye Automobile de Monte-Carlo, the first race for the new C4, following that with a solid second place after Grönholm, in Sweden, to set a two-point lead over the Finn after two of 16 rounds. At the first Rally Norway, Loeb went off and lost eight minutes during SS12 while chasing Grönholm and the leader, Mikko Hirvonen. On the next stage, he made another mistake and lost nine minutes. He eventually finished 14th in the rally and dropped to third in the championship standings. He won 8 of the 18 stages in this rally. Loeb won the next rally, the 21º Corona Rally México, 55.8 seconds clear of Grönholm.
He then followed this success with his third and fourth season victories on the Portuguese and Argentinian rallies. Characteristically, he was once more to be found in the lead on the seventh round, the Rally d'Italia in Sardinia. On new stages on the final leg to those of the previous year, however, Loeb was once more to lament error and the surrender of probable victory, this time after crashing and breaking his car's suspension in a ditch. He left the lead in the hands of Grönholm, who won to propel himself seven points ahead of Loeb at the top of the championship standings. A second loss to the Finn in as many years on the Acropolis Rally then extended the deficit to nine points over the championship's summer break.
Loeb occupied his recess by, amongst other engagements, competing in the Shell Donegal International Rally on 15, 16 and 17 June, partially as preparation for the coming Rally Ireland World Championship round that November. He scored a comprehensive victory, albeit only after being given a scare by the pace of tenacious private Subaru-driver Mark Higgins, who had a 45-second lead at the end of day one. Punctures afflicted upon his rival eventually settled the contest.
Ambitions of finally scoring victory on Rally Finland proved once more unrealised, with Loeb relegated to third place behind the pacy natives Grönholm and Hirvonen. Rallye Deutschland, as was traditional, differed somewhat. At the scene of his first victory and on a rally where he had never subsequently lost, Loeb was left unexpectedly to fend off the challenge not of the Finn, but of a privateer, his one-time teammate and championship returnee François Duval. He eventually triumphed and reduced some of his championship points deficit.

A very close battle on the gravel stages of Rally New Zealand ended with the second closest win in WRC history – Loeb finished only 0.3s behind his main rival. The next two rounds allowed the French driver to regain some points, as he won both tarmac events – Rallye Espana, where his teammate Dani Sordo took second place and two points from Grönholm, and Rally France.
Rally Japan was another dramatic event – Loeb got the chance to take the lead in the Championship after Grönholm's early mistake, but he was unable to, as his co-driver's mistake caused the C4 to go off the road on one of the stages of second leg. Both drivers ended with no points after finally retiring from the event. In Ireland, during 1st Rally Ireland almost the same happened – Marcus Grönholm overcooked a slippery right corner on one of the early stages, trying to keep a fast pace, and had to retire from the rally. Loeb made use of his rival's mistake and, by making no major mistakes, although having some suspension-related problems with keeping pace at the beginning, he added 10 points to his account, moving ahead of the Finnish driver just one round before the season's end. In Wales he was not fighting for the win, focusing mostly on securing his advantage, finishing the event third – on 2 December 2007 Loeb became World Rally Champion for the fourth time in a row.


==== 2008 ====
Loeb started the 2008 season with a record fifth win in Monte Carlo. On the second rally of the year, 2008 Swedish Rally, he crashed out during day one. Although he re-joined the rally to collect manufacturers' points, the team later decided to retire him due to a damaged engine. After winning in Mexico and Argentina, Loeb had a crash with Conrad Rautenbach on a road section in Jordan, from which he could only recover to take tenth place in the rally. He went on to win two events, and then finish close third to the Ford factory team duo Mikko Hirvonen and Jari-Matti Latvala at the Rally of Turkey.
Loeb later notably won the Rally Finland ahead of Hirvonen. This was the fourth time in the event's 58-year history that a non-Nordic driver won the rally, after Carlos Sainz in 1990, Didier Auriol in 1992 and Markko Märtin in 2003. This started a string of five victories for Loeb. In Germany, New Zealand and Spain, Citroën also took double wins as his teammate Dani Sordo took three runner-up spots in a row.

Going into the penultimate round of the season, the 2008 Rally Japan, Loeb led Hirvonen by 14 points and needed a third place to secure the world drivers' title. Finishing behind Ford's Hirvonen and Latvala, Loeb broke Juha Kankkunen's, Tommi Mäkinen's and his own record of four titles and became the first five-time world champion in rallying.After clinching the World Rally Championship, Loeb edged out Latvala to take his first Wales Rally GB win, a feat which also helped secure his team their first manufacturers' title since 2005, from 2006 and 2007 victors Ford.


==== 2009 ====
Loeb started the year by winning Rally Ireland for the second time since 2007. He then won his first Rally Norway ever, after a fierce battle with Mikko Hirvonen, lasting throughout the very final stage. Being first on the road through all three days, Loeb kept his lead, in the end winning with 9.8 seconds over Hirvonen. Loeb continued his good form by winning over Hirvonen in Cyprus, marking his career 50th victory, and in Portugal. His victory in Argentina, the fifth in a row in this country, was also his fifth victory in a row since the start of the season.
At the Rally d'Italia Sardegna, Loeb had a puncture after going off the road and dropped from third to fourth. Although he passed Petter Solberg for the final podium spot, he still finished fourth due to a time penalty for a safety rule violation; co-driver Daniel Elena had unfastened his safety belts before the crew stopped the car for a tyre change. At the Acropolis Rally, Loeb crashed out from third place. On Rally Poland's return to the WRC, Loeb had another crash but he continued in the event under superally rules. After team orders issued for the Citroën Junior Team drivers and a late mistake by Ford's Jari-Matti Latvala, Loeb found himself seventh but had lost the championship lead to Hirvonen by one point.By winning the Rally Catalunya, Loeb reduced the deficit to Hirvonen in the title race before the final event of the year; once again trailing by a single point. The Frenchman gained the championship by winning the final event of the year, the Rally GB. Victory was secured partly due to an incredible performance over SS8 and SS9, where in the course of only two stages Loeb extended his lead in the rally over Hirvonen from 2.4s to 25s.


==== 2010 ====
The 2010 WRC season started with the snow-based Swedish Rally, where Loeb finished second behind Ford's Mikko Hirvonen. He went on to take a clear championship lead by winning the following three gravel events: Rally México, Jordan Rally and Rally of Turkey. In New Zealand, Loeb finished third in a tight battle that saw the top five finish within 26 seconds of each other. In Portugal, Loeb narrowly lost the win to his countryman Sébastien Ogier of the Citroën Junior Team, who took his debut win in the World Rally Championship. In the following Rally Bulgaria, a new event in the series and the season's first tarmac rally, Loeb won while Citroën scored the WRC's first 1–2–3–4 in seventeen years.At the 60th Rally Finland, Loeb beat Citroën privateer Petter Solberg to the final podium position, behind Ford's Jari-Matti Latvala and Ogier. He went on to win the Rallye Deutschland for the eighth time in a row, marking the first time a driver has won a WRC rally eight times. After a fifth place in Japan, Loeb secured a record-extending seventh consecutive World Rally Championship title by winning his home event, the Rallye de France. As the Rallye de France–Alsace had replaced the Tour de Corse as the French round of the WRC, Loeb ended up clinching the title on a final stage that was held in his home town of Haguenau, Alsace.During the course of the season, he was on the podium of all events but one (Japan where he finished fifth), and ended up the season with a record 105 points over runner-up Jari-Matti Latvala.


==== 2011 ====
The 2011 season brought a new generation of World Rally Cars. Now at the wheel of a Citroën DS3 WRC, Loeb started his year by finishing sixth at the Rally Sweden. He went on to win in Mexico for the fifth time in row, after teammate Sébastien Ogier crashed out from a narrow lead. In Portugal, Loeb finished second to Ogier and took his first Power Stage win, collecting three more points from the final stage. At the Jordan Rally, held during the Arab Spring, the entire first day was cancelled. Loeb placed third behind the closest-ever finish in the history of the World Rally Championship. He then beat Ford's Mikko Hirvonen to the win at the Rally d'Italia Sardegna.
In Argentina, Loeb won after a tight three-way battle, taking the lead from Ogier on the final stage and finishing 2.4 seconds ahead of Hirvonen. At the next event, the Acropolis Rally in Greece, Loeb had to settle for second behind Ogier. In the high-speed Rally Finland, he beat Jari-Matti Latvala to become the first non-Nordic driver to win twice in the event's 60-year history. In August, Loeb signed a two-year contract extension with Citroën. At the Rallye Deutschland, Loeb held a close lead ahead of Ogier after the first day and Citroën decided to freeze the situation. A puncture later dropped Loeb out of contention and he finished behind his teammate. This ended his record win streak in Germany and was the first time that he had lost in a tarmac-based event since the 2006 Monte Carlo Rally. Tension in the team grew; David Evans of Autosport wrote that ""it's war between the two Sebs"".
Before Australia, Loeb held a 25-point lead in the championship ahead of Ogier. During the first day of the rally, both Sébastiens crashed out. Loeb later gained a point by climbing to tenth place after Citroën ordered Ogier to slow down. In his home event, the Rallye de France, Loeb took the lead from the start but soon fell victim to a rare engine failure in his DS3 WRC and had to retire. As Ogier beat Mini's Dani Sordo to the win, Loeb now tied the lead in the championship with Hirvonen, and Ogier was only three points adrift. At the Rally Catalunya, Loeb took his fifth win of the season and broke Markku Alén's record (801) for most stage wins in the world championship. He carried an eight-point lead over Hirvonen into the season-ending Wales Rally GB. Loeb took the rally lead from Latvala on the third stage, but lost it to Hirvonen by 0.4 seconds on stage six. However, Hirvonen soon went wide, spun and broke his radiator, which in turn caused severe engine problems. As Hirvonen was unable to restart, Loeb secured his eighth consecutive world championship. This title moved him ahead of seven-time champion Michael Schumacher in terms of major motorsport championships won. While running in second place behind Latvala, Loeb retired from the rally due to a road section collision with a spectator who had driven his car on the wrong side of a narrow road.


==== 2012 ====
Loeb began his 2012 season by beating Mini's Dani Sordo to a record sixth win in the Monte Carlo Rally. He also secured the maximum points by recording the fastest time for the power stage. In Sweden, after hitting a snowbank on stage seven, Loeb was forced out of the fight for the number one spot. He finished sixth and gained three extra points by again winning the power stage. Loeb took his second victory of the season at the Rally Mexico, ahead of his new teammate Mikko Hirvonen.
In Portugal, he crashed out from third place on the night stages of the first day, after misunderstanding a pacenote. The Rally Argentina was dominated by the Citroëns and Loeb drove to his 70th WRC victory. At the Acropolis Rally in Greece, he cruised to an easy win after Ford's Jari-Matti Latvala and Petter Solberg ran into several problems and dropped out of contention.He went on to continue his WRC win streak in New Zealand and in Finland, where he edged out Hirvonen to take his third win in the event. This marked the fourth double win in a row for the Citroën duo. After beating Latvala to the win in Germany, Loeb finished second to the Finn at the Wales Rally GB, after a tight battle for the position with Solberg.In late September, Loeb announced his retirement from full-time rallying, stating that he would compete only in selected events during the upcoming season. He added that he is interested in taking on a new challenge such as the World Touring Car Championship. In his home event, the Rallye de France, Loeb built a cushion over Latvala and title rival Hirvonen on the first two days. He then held Latvala at bay on the wet roads on Sunday, securing a record ninth drivers' title in the World Rally Championship and aiding Citroën to its eighth manufacturers' title. German magazine Auto Bild noted that Loeb was now two world championship titles clear of Schumacher and equal to Valentino Rossi, and dubbed him ""the best rally driver of all time and a shining light in motorsport."" Former world champion Ari Vatanen opined that Loeb's records are unlikely to be broken.


==== 2013 ====
Loeb competed in five rallies of the 2013 season: Monte Carlo, Sweden, Argentina, Germany and France. He started his partial WRC season with a win in Monte Carlo, and finished last to Sébastien Ogier in Sweden, followed by another win in Argentina. Ahead of his home rally in France, it has been speculated it could be his WRC swansong.  It was confirmed on 1 October 2013 as Loeb will continue racing for Citroën, this time for World Touring Car Championship.  However, Loeb crashed out on the first stage of day three.  The rally was eventually won by Sebastien Ogier.


==== 2014–20 ====

==== 2022 ====
At the Monte Carlo Rally, Loeb participated alongside Isabelle Galmiche for M-Sport Ford World Rally Team, barely having recovered from the Dakar Rally and with very little time behind the wheel of a WRC car since 2018. He battled his former rival Sébastien Ogier (co-driver Benjamin Veillas) all rally long, till Ogier got a puncture in the penultimate stage. At the final stage Loeb led by 9.5s, and Ogier got a 10-second penalty for a jumpstart. Loeb won his 80th WRC rally by 10.5s over Ogier, first for a manufacturer other than Citroën World Rally Team and his first with a co-driver other than Daniel Elena. He also became the oldest driver to lead and win a WRC Rally. Galmiche became the first woman co-driver to win a WRC event since Fabrizia Pons in 1997.
At the Rally de Portugal, Loeb and Galmiche were 10.1 seconds behind rally leader Elfyn Evans (co-driver Scott Martin) in SS3, but won the next stage and took 10.6 seconds out of their deficit; therefore putting them in the overall rally lead by 0.5 seconds over Evans. At the first corner of SS5 though, Loeb slid wide into a barrier, completely destroying his rear-right suspension. On Saturday, Loeb had another mechanical issue which forced him to retire.
The next rally they took part in was the Safari Rally. The last time Loeb participated in that rally before 2022 was in 2002. Loeb and Galmiche had good speed and even managed to win a stage on Friday, but Loeb's engine had a small fire and wouldn't start up later. They retired for the day. Even though they were out of contention, they won two more stages on Sunday and ultimately recovered to eighth place.
Loeb and Galmiche then took part in the Acropolis Rally, where they ran for the lead alongside M Sport teammate Pierre-Louis Loubet (co driver Vincent Landais). Both crews traded stage wins, but Loeb was leading with Friday done. On the next day though, Loeb again encountered issues and had to retire.

The transmission broke on the first day, but their determination to finish meant that they scored valuable points. In the last stage they had two punctures and drove cautiously for the last 200 km. They still managed to score 28 points, bringing the total to 112 and led the W2RC standings by one point from Al Attiyah and Baumel.At the Rallye du Maroc, Loeb and Lurquin ran among the leading times, but in Stage 4 encountered a mechanical issue they couldn't fix, and hence dropped back in the overall rally  standings. They continued to run the rally for earning points in the W2RC standings. They finished the rally with two stage wins.

He also lost time with mechanical issues, with a tradrod breakage on stage 3 and a minor crash on stage 5, from which he was able to recover from and continue.


=== Racing ===


==== Le Mans and sports cars ====
As his WRC stature grew, Loeb began to participate in road racing events and tests. He first competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans sports car race in 2005, where he drove for the Pescarolo Sport team's No. 17 entry. Reportedly Loeb did much of his preparation for the race by running practice laps around the circuit in the Sony PlayStation 2 video game Gran Turismo 4 aboard a private jet. In the race the car was plagued by incidents, but Loeb proved to be able to drive fast for his first race on a closed track. Loeb finished second overall in the 2006 24 Hours of Le Mans in a Pescarolo-Judd, between the two Diesel-powered Audi R10.
Free time in his WRC schedule allows him to race in the French GT Championship (FFSA GT) where he drove a Ferrari 550 Prodrive and a Porsche 911 GT3-RSR as well as in the French Carrera Cup where he achieved top-10 finishes.  For 2012 Loeb launched Sébastien Loeb Racing which competes in FFSA GT and the European Le Mans Series.  Loeb drove for his own team at the Circuit de Pau in the French Carrera Cup and won the race.


==== Formula One ====
Loeb has had a number of Formula One tests. He first tested for Renault F1 at Paul Ricard in December 2007, in a switch that saw Heikki Kovalainen test Loeb's WRC car.Red Bull, which became a major sponsor of the Citroën factory team during the 2008 season, rewarded Loeb for winning the WRC with a Formula One test in Red Bull Racing's 2008-spec Red Bull RB4. He first drove the car at Silverstone, and then took part in the first official Formula One winter test in Barcelona. Loeb was eighth quickest of 17 drivers.Loeb continued to set his sights on a switch to Formula One in 2009. Following stories that fellow Frenchman Sébastien Bourdais was under threat at Toro Rosso, Loeb told French newspaper L'Équipe that he was interested in replacing Bourdais at the Red Bull-backed team. He intended to make his F1 debut at the 2009 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix which took place in November, after the WRC season finished, with a view to making the switch full-time for 2010. However, this plan was scuppered when he was not granted an FIA Super Licence, rendering him ineligible to race in F1 for the foreseeable future as he had not done enough circuit racing at lower levels. He had also been in contact with the US F1 Team about a possible drive for 2010.Loeb has also taken part in an official GP2 Series testing session after the 2009 season, where he drove for the David Price Racing team, finishing last of 25 drivers.

Loeb paired up with Portuguese driver Álvaro Parente in one of the cars while Frenchman Mike Parisy and Austrian Andreas Zuber were the driver pairing for the other Sébastien Loeb Racing car. Loeb and Parente took a total of three qualifying race wins and one championship race win on their way to fourth place overall in the season. A number of reliability issues and racing incidents prevented the pair from scoring more victories.
Loeb also participated in two races of the 2013 Porsche Supercup season at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya and Circuit de Monaco circuits, both events being held as support category races for the 2013 Formula One season. Loeb finished 11th in Spain and 16th in Monaco.

In his first full season in circuit racing, Loeb won two races and scored six podiums on his way to third in the championship behind surprise champion Lopez and runner-up Muller. In the next season, he scored four wins and twelve podiums; again finishing third overall though with 61 more points. For the following season, contesting the Dakar Rally meant Loeb switched to Peugeot Sport and was not retained by Citroën for the 2016 WTCC season; which he expressed surprise at as he was hoping to contest for the WTCC title that season.


==== FIA World Rallycross Championship ====
On 29 February 2016 it was officially revealed that Loeb is going to join the factory backed Swedish Team Peugeot-Hansen to participate in all 12 rounds of the 2016 FIA World Rallycross Championship, together with his Swedish teammate Timmy Hansen.

Seefeel,"Seefeel are a British electronic and post-rock band formed in the early 1990s by Mark Clifford (guitar, programming), Daren Seymour (bass), Justin Fletcher (drums, programming), and Sarah Peacock (vocals, guitar). Their work became known for fusing guitar-based shoegaze with the production techniques of ambient techno and electronica.Initially forming as a more conventional rock band, Seefeel soon embraced electronic production and gained recognition for their 1993 debut EP More Like Space and first album Quique (1993), both on the British independent label Too Pure. The band subsequently released music on electronic labels Warp Records and Rephlex, and then went on an extended hiatus in 1997, with members pursuing the side-projects Scala and Disjecta. 
Following the reissue of Quique in 2007, Clifford and Peacock relaunched Seefeel and were joined by Shigeru Ishihara (DJ Scotch Egg) on bass, and former Boredoms drummer Iida Kazuhisa (E-Da). In 2010 they released the Faults EP (their first new recording in 14 years) followed shortly after by an eponymous LP in 2011, both on Warp.


== History ==


=== Early years ===
Clifford originally began writing tracks for what became Seefeel in late 1991. He placed an advert at Goldsmiths College, London where he was a student, and it was answered by Fletcher who joined him on drums. Peacock became part of the group after Clifford answered an advert she had placed in the NME. Soon Darren Seymour joined them on bass. Early recordings were made at home, and other London studios. A demo tape was sent to three record companies and to John Peel at BBC Radio 1. John Peel rang Peacock to say how much he liked the tracks and the band would later perform a session for his Radio 1 show. Soon after, one of the labels that had been sent a demo, Too Pure, approached the band.


=== First releases on Too Pure ===
The band's first release was the self-produced More Like Space EP, released in Autumn 1993. It was largely compiled from four-track home recordings, but enhanced in the studio. Subsequently, the Plainsong EP was released along with an EP of remixes including two remixes of 'Time to Find Me' by Aphex Twin. Notorious for tearing tracks apart when remixing them, Aphex Twin notably left the track much as it was released, asserting in an interview for Lime Lizard magazine, prior to remixing the track  ""I think it's gonna be a weird kind of a mix because I really, really like their stuff as it is, and what I'm going to do is just add a groove to it. But I'm definitely gonna make it slow. The main reason I like it is that as soon as you turn it off it leaves this big gap, this really big void. Fucking hell, that's well intense, I love it!"" These first two EPs, along with the remix EP, were later released in the US as a single CD Polyfusia, by Astralwerks.
The band's first album, Quique, was released in October 1993. Initial recordings for the album were made at home before the band transferred to Falconer Studios in North London, where the recordings were finished and the album mixed. It was mixed and produced by Mark Clifford. On its release, Quique was critically acclaimed, and was one of Melody Maker's 'Albums of the Year'. In his review for the Melody Maker, Simon Reynolds called the album ""consummate, a blanched canvas for the imagination"". Spin magazine's review stated ""Seefeel, have struck a sublime groove midway between MBV's sensual tumult and Aphex Twin's ambient serenity"" going on to add ""you try to squint your ear in order to bring the music into focus, then give up, and just bask in the gorgeous, amorphous glow"".Quique was re-released in 2007 in redux form, containing alternate versions and material not released at the time. Reviewing this re-issue Pitchfork stated that ""Seefeel's music continues to sparkle 14 years later, an entire generation having built an ambient-motorik noise-pop aesthetic around Quique songs like 'Plainsong'"" and adding ""Quique still sounds timeless"".The band also became a notable live act, receiving many positive reviews in the NME and Melody Maker. In his review in Melody Maker of their show at the Garage, London, just prior to the release of Quique, Simon Reynolds noted their performance was ""like an orgasm turned into an environment, a honeycomb space of luminous, globular goo. You feel like you're actually inside the drugged or orgasmic body, a grotto of rushes, tingles, shivers, pangs, spasms"" further adding that the band was ""a pipe-dream come true, and the best new band of '93"". The band toured in Europe with the Cocteau Twins soon after the release of Quique, and Mark Clifford later undertook remix work for the band.


=== Signing to Warp Records ===
Following the success of Quique, Seefeel were approached by Warp Records in early 1994. They subsequently signed to the label and became the first band signed to Warp who used guitars. Steve Beckett, the label's owner said in an interview ""Seefeel were the first band that Warp signed who had guitars...they were brave to sign to us because they became the 'older siblings' in the family and took all the flak by breaking the unwritten rules of an (up until then) purely dance label"".The band's first release on the label was the 1994 Starethrough EP. The four tracks emphasised the electronic side of the band more than previous recordings. The EP included the track ""Spangle"", which was featured on Warp's Artificial Intelligence II compilation and, in 2009, on the Warp20 compilation Chosen, being voted in the all-time Top 20 Warp tracks by the label's fans and being one of the choices of Warp founder Steve Beckett. The single ""Fracture"" was released soon after, along with a video made by Peacock, the band's first. The video appeared on the DVD WarpVision. Seefeel's first album for Warp, Succour, was released in 1995. Succour incorporated a darker, more abstracted sound than their first album, and while commercially a more difficult record, was nevertheless again well received. Writing in the NME, Sharon O'Connell stated ""Succour provides both everything and nothing and is just as much a minefield as a treasure trove. It's beautiful. Be careful"". The band played several dates of their own as well as touring alongside Spiritualized. They also recorded a four track session at Maida Vale Studios in London for the John Peel Show on BBC Radio 1. Touring, however, took its strain on the band and they embarked on a self-imposed hiatus which, although designed initially as a break, turned into a long absence.In 1996, Seefeel released (CH-VOX) on Rephlex. After remixing ""Time to Find Me"", Richard James and Mark Clifford had become friends. James had asked Clifford and Seefeel to do a record for his Rephlex label and they had agreed. When signing to Warp Records, their contract recognised the promise made to James and following the release of Succour, Rephlex were given tracks recorded during these sessions and after but unreleased. Although intended as an EP, the record is considered by many to be the band's 'third' album. (CH-Vox) reduced percussion to a bare minimum and brought aural tapestries of processed guitar and fragmented sounds to the forefront.


=== Relaunch – 2009 to the present ===
Following the re-issue of their first album Quique in 2007, Clifford and Peacock discussed writing new material. Clifford recalls, ""Sarah and I got together to do some interviews and we just talked and decided to exchange a few ideas to see if Seefeel was worth pursuing again"". In an interview for Bleep.com, Clifford further explained ""I was forced to listen to (Quique) again and also to dig out unreleased recordings and for the first time in a long time I realised that actually we were good. We had something special"". Daren Seymour and Justin Fletcher were not able to be a part of the rejuvenated band due to prior commitments and living outside the UK, so Clifford recruited Kazuhisa Iida (ex-Boredoms) and Shigeru Ishihara (DJ Scotch Egg) on drums and bass respectively. They were asked by Warp to play at the label's 20th anniversary show in Paris in 2009 and  Steve Beckett was so taken with their performance, he encouraged them to re-sign to Warp and to record new material. They began writing new tracks and eventually decamped to Church Road Studios in Brighton, though material was eventually mixed at home. The first fruits of their sessions was the 2010 Faults EP, followed in 2011 by the self-titled album Seefeel. The recordings showed a grittier side to the band. The Guardian newspaper observed ""instruments glitched and phased into near-oblivion, their riffs reborn as weird digital signatures"", going on to call the album ""A hugely impressive rebirth"". Boomkat noted ""Seefeel have moved with the times, adjusting their trademark sound with characteristically fractal noise textures from Shigeru and more organic, pounding drums from Boredoms' E-da. There's still a sunkissed bliss running throughout the album, but it's of a more sullied, toxic variety"".

Scala's sound was described by AllMusic as ""More indebted to noise and trip-hop than the looped sound-wash Seefeel had been known for, the quartet also focused on a somewhat tighter song structure and emphasized Peacock's vocals."" Scala released their debut album  Beauty Nowhere in 1997 followed by two albums in 1998: To You in Alpha and Compass Heart. After working with Scala, Peacock continued work in the group January.

Mindelo,"Mindelo is a port city in the northern part of the island of São Vicente in Cape Verde. Mindelo is also the seat of the parish of Nossa Senhora da Luz, and the municipality of São Vicente. The city is home to 93% of the entire island's population. Mindelo is known for its colourful and animated carnival celebrations, with roots in Portuguese traditions later influenced by the Brazilian culture.


== History ==
A settlement at Mindelo was founded in 1793 by the Portuguese.: 34  It was initially named Nossa Senhora da Luz, renamed Leopoldina around 1820 after the Queen consort. In 1838 it was renamed Mindelo after the 1832 Landing at Mindelo, north of Porto.: 42–48  It became a coal deposit for ships of the British East India Company in 1838, followed by the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company in 1850. The settlement became a town (vila) in 1858, and had 1,400 inhabitants then.: 55  It became a city (cidade) in 1879, and had 3,717 inhabitants then.: 61–63  In 1884 a submarine communications cable was laid between Europe, Africa, India and North America, making Mindelo an important communications centre for the British Empire.
From the beginning of the 20th century the port of Mindelo lost its importance for transatlantic navigation. Causes for this were the shift from coal to oil as fuel for ships, the rise of competing ports like Dakar and the Canary Islands and the lack of investment in port infrastructure.: 76–80  Between 1910 and 1940 there were several strikes in Mindelo, and on 7 June 1934 there were riots in the streets of Mindelo, caused by unemployment and poverty. One man was killed; several were injured.Between 1940 and 1958 three prolonged periods of severe drought, combined with soil erosion and overgrazing, brought famine in Cape Verde. In the whole archipelago, about 45,000 people died and 20,000 people emigrated. Mindelo attracted immigrants, notably from nearby Santo Antão, and continued to grow.: 86 Mindelo was the cultural capital of the Portuguese-speaking world from November 2002 until November 2003.

Dakshinamurti Upanishad,"The Dakshinamurti Upanishad (Sanskrit: दक्षिणामूर्ति उपनिषत्, IAST: Dakṣiṇāmūrti Upaniṣad) is an ancient Sanskrit text and is one of the minor Upanishads of Hinduism. It is attached to the Krishna Yajurveda, and classified as one of the 14 Shaiva Upanishads.The text is notable for asserting that Dakshinamurti is an aspect of Shiva, an aid to the liberating knowledge that Shiva is within oneself as Atman (self, soul), and everything one does in daily life is an offering to this Shiva.


== Name ==
The text is named after Jnana (knowledge) aspect of the Hindu god Shiva, as Dakshinamurti which means giver of knowledge. He is traditionally the expounder of the Shastras, represented as seating under a Banyan tree in the Himalayas resplendent with energy and bliss, surrounded and revered by sages, in a yoga pose (virasana), holding the fire of knowledge in one hand and a book or snake or lotus or nilotpala flower in another. Dakshinamurti is the ""teacher-god"", with Atma-vidya, literally the knowledge of Atman (soul, self). He is the ancient guru, who teaches One Self through silence.The term Upanishad means it is knowledge or ""hidden doctrine"" text that belongs to the corpus of Vedanta literature collection presenting the philosophical concepts of Hinduism and considered the highest purpose of its scripture, the Vedas.


== History ==
In the Telugu language anthology of 108 Upanishads of the Muktika canon, narrated by Rama to Hanuman, it is listed as Dakṣiṇāmūrti Upaniṣad at number 49.The manuscripts of the text are sometimes titled as Dakṣiṇāmūrtyupaniṣad.


== Contents ==

The Upanishad is structured as a single chapter with 20 verses. The text opens with a prelude, wherein Vedic sages including Sanaka approach sage Markandeya, with firewood in hand, and ask him, ""how are you so blissful, what is the secret behind your long content life?"" Markandeya answers that it is the knowledge of the secret of Shiva, which is knowing the Reality. The sages ask back, what is this Reality? what is the means to it, what is the aid to that knowledge, who is the deity, what offerings, how should one devote oneself to it, at what time and how?Shiva is the Dakshinamukha, states the text through Markandeya, he as deity is the aid, he is the one into whom the universe will dissolve and into whom all will be absorbed back, he is who shines, he is inherently blissful and happy because he knows his true nature.After the prelude, the first three verses of the text describes the iconography of Dakshinamurti, as being of silver color, moon crested near his hair, seated in yoga posture, holding in his various hands a rosary, a vessel of amrita (nectar of eternal life), a book symbolizing knowledge, the Shiva serpent, his forehead and body marked with holy ash, with axe, deer and sages surrounding him, as he sits under a banyan-fig tree.The verse 4 of the text represents his alternate iconography as holding a vina (musical instrument). Dakshinamurti, asserts verse 5 of the text, is the essential meaning of the Vedas.True devotion, defines the Upanishad, is to meditate before Dakshinamurti, with the constant thought of ""I am He"", that is ""I am identical with Shiva"". The means to secret knowledge of Shiva, states the text, is to concentrate and realize that Shiva is no different than oneself, that all bodily human action, in one's life, is an offering to Shiva. The best time to worship this Reality, asserts the text, is in all three states of consciousness – during action when one is awake, during rest when one is dreaming in sleep, and in the state of deep sleep.The gathered sages, states the text, then ask Markadeya for the form and manifestation of Shiva, and who should be the worshipper? The worshipper, asserts the text, is one who seeks the lamp of wisdom, within whom is the oil of indifference to that which is the worldly superficiality, who has the wick of devotion for the light of knowledge. Once the darkness within is dispelled, Shiva becomes manifested in the worshipper, states the Upanishad. Shiva, asserts the text, then dwells in the devotee as his Self, the bliss, the wisdom, and he is free of all notions of duality.This is the secret doctrine of Shiva, the Reality. He who studies it, is delivered from all sins, and is the one who attains kaivalya, asserts the text.

Jam Filled Entertainment,"Jam Filled Entertainment is a Canadian animation studio based in Ottawa, Ontario with additional facilities in Toronto and Halifax and is a division of Boat Rocker Media. It is best known for animating Thomas & Friends between 2013 and 2021 and Nicktoons such as The Loud House, and its spinoff The Casagrandes.


== History ==
Jam Filled Entertainment was founded in Manotick in 2007 by Kyle MacDougall, Phil Lafrance, and Jamie Leclaire. In January 2011, Jam Filled moved to a new location in Ottawa. On August 3, 2016, Boat Rocker Media acquired Jam Filled Entertainment. On August 22, Jam Filled purchased the assets of Arc Productions, allowing them to expand into creating CGI animation in Toronto. Jam Filled opened a 10,000 square feet studio in Halifax, Nova Scotia in the fall of 2019 to work on more 2D animation projects.


=== Jam Filled Toronto ===
The Toronto branch of Jam Filled Entertainment was originally established as Dan Krech Productions on June 24, 1985, as one of the first visual effects companies in Toronto. In 1987, DKP became the first company in Canada to have an in-house digital suite. DKP had produced visual effects and animation for over 2,000 commercials and long-form projects by 2000, many of them for U.S. companies. DKP moved to a new facility on Queen Street East in March 2001. American telecommunications company IDT Corporation acquired DKP Effects on March 16, 2004, leading to the company being renamed DKP Studios.
On 26 May 2006, Liberty Media bought IDT Entertainment from IDT, including Anchor Bay Entertainment and Film Roman, and merged it with the Starz cable network to form Starz Media. Under its new management in 2007, the studio began a ""Starz Shortz"" program which has produced Bundle of Joy, Enter the Sandbox, Ormie and Lovebirds. In 2007, Starz Animation took over animating Shane Acker's feature 9 from Attitude Studio, Luxembourg. In 2010, the studio opened a major VFX wing to create all the effects for the new Starz Channel/Graham King Productions miniseries, Camelot, Alcon Entertainment's Dolphin Tale, and producer Avi Arad's family feature, Robosapien: Rebooted.
In April 2011, Liberty Starz sold Starz Animation to a Canadian consortium, and it was renamed Arc Productions. Under the new owner, the studio was planning to do more proprietary production.On August 1, 2016, Arc Productions announced that they were closing down the studio because they were filing for bankruptcy and locked out over 500 employees after telling them there was a payroll glitch and no one had been paid. On August 10, 2016, following Arc's closure, Jam Filled Entertainment entered an agreement to acquire Arc Productions' assets in which they call ""substantially all of the business"". Jam Filled Entertainment also acquired 248 of Arc's former employees. Later on August 22, 2016, Arc Productions was reopened as Jam Filled Entertainment's Toronto facility.In 2020, Jam Filled announced that they would no longer animate episodes of the original Thomas & Friends series after the 24th and final series, with Nelvana taking over for the 2D-animated reboot series, Thomas & Friends: All Engines Go.

Wiki Peak,"Wiki Peak is a mountain in the Nutzotin Mountains of Alaska within Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve. It is located near the Canada–United States border. The best way to reach Wiki Peak is to charter a flight into Horsfeld. Crossing Beaver Creek is necessary to access Wiki Peak. The creek can be high and dangerous or easily crossed, depending on time of year and the weather.


== Obsidian ==
Wiki Peak obsidian was used by humans as early as 13,400 cal BP. Such obsidian was recovered at the Broken Mammoth site. Such obsidian was also used at the Walker Road, Alaska, site, and Moose Creek, Alaska, site in the same area—all dating to before 13,000 cal BP.

""The Wiki Peak obsidian source is in the Nutzotin Mountains (Wrangell-St Elias National Park). An investigation of the Wiki Peak obsidian source was conducted in the past decade, and over 65 archaeological sites were recorded in a survey of the immediate area. The high concentration of sites is typical for other obsidian source areas in Alaska and northwest Canada, with few exceptions.

Dragon (firearm),"A dragon is a shortened version of blunderbuss, a firearm with a short, large caliber barrel which is flared at the muzzle and frequently throughout the entire bore. Dragons were typically issued to dragoon cavalry, who needed a lightweight, easily handled firearm to use while mounted.


== Etymology ==
The term dragon is taken from the fact that early versions were decorated with a carving in the form of a mythical dragon's head around the muzzle; the muzzle blast would then give the impression of a fire-breathing dragon.


== History and description ==
Early dragons were short wheellock firearms. It is called a dragon because the muzzle is decorated with a dragon's head. The practice comes from a time when all gunpowder weapons had distinctive names, including the culverin, serpentine, falcon, and falconet. The dragon was effective only at short range, lacking accuracy at long range.In the Nusantara archipelago, the weapon is called a tarkul, terakul, or terakol, and seems to have been preferred by cavalry due to its size. The term may refer to a blunderbuss in pistol form, but can also refer to the flintlock musket.: 211 : 5  They used a flintlock mechanism, and might be derived from Dutch flintlocks which entered the area in the 17th century.: 64  However, it is possible that this weapon was only popular among local warriors in more recent times — the terakul was only recorded in Tuhfat al-Nafis from the 1860s.: 211–212  The manuscript mentioned that Bugis troops with chain mail and armed with terakul pemburas (dragon-blunderbusses) defeated Raja Kechil's troops armed with cannons and swords in 1721 CE.: 318

Antoinette IV,"The Antoinette IV was an early French monoplane.


== Design and development ==
The Antoinette IV was a high-wing aircraft with a fuselage of extremely narrow triangular cross-section and a cruciform tail. Power was provided by a V8 engine of Léon Levavasseur's own design driving a paddle-bladed tractor propeller. Lateral control was at first effected with large triangular, and shortly afterwards trapezoidal-planform  ailerons hinged to the trailing edge of the wings, although wing-warping was substituted at an early stage in flight trials, and in this type proved more effective.
On 19 February 1909, the Antoinette IV flew 5 km (3.1 mi) at Mourmelon-le-Grand, and on 19 July, Hubert Latham attempted to cross the English Channel in it, covering 11 km (6.8 mi) out of Sangatte before making a forced water landing due to engine failure.On 3 October 1910, Frenchman René Thomas, flying the Antoinette IV, collided with British Army Captain Bertram Dickson by ramming his Farman III biplane in the rear. Both pilots survived, but Dickson was so badly injured that he never flew again.

In the 1980s Taiwan ordered two submarines from a Dutch shipyard which were delivered despite tremendous Chinese pressure. China accused the Netherlands of colluding with American President Ronald Reagan and downgraded relations with the Netherlands and threatened to do the same to the US. In 1984 the Netherlands agreed not to export additional military goods in order to restore relations.Netherlands export to China includes petrochemicals, machinery, transport equipment, food, high technology and fossil fuels. China's export to the Netherlands includes computer and consumer electronics, toys and clothes.In March 2014, Chinese leader and CCP general secretary Xi Jinping made the first state visit of China to the Netherlands in history.

Elizabeth Putnam Sohier,"Elizabeth Putnam Sohier (1847–1926), a member of Boston's wealthy class, persuaded the Massachusetts Legislature to establish the Free Library Commission in 1890—the first of its kind in the United States. She and Anna Eliot Ticknor became the first women appointed to a United States state library agency when they were appointed to that commission in 1890. As a member of the Free Public Library Commission for thirty six years she worked tirelessly to ensure that every city and town in Massachusetts had a library. She also worked to encourage these libraries, once established, to expand collections and circulation. In 1952 the Commission was renamed the Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners.
Sohier was also active in the Woman's Education Association of Boston and instrumental in setting up a committee on libraries. The group established traveling libraries, a traveling picture collection, and collections of travel books. The WEA was responsible for encouraging other states to establish traveling libraries in states such as California, Iowa, Kansas, Wisconsin.Throughout her years of service, Sohier found opportunities for libraries to be effective. During the 1912 Lawrence Textile Strike when it became apparent that many of the workers were foreign born Sohier worked with the Governor to obtain books for the strikers.  During World War I the Commission worked with the American Library Association to provide library services to soldiers in camps.  She was a member of the Board of Trustees of the Beverly Public Library for thirty years.

Flag of Gorzów Wielkopolski,"The civil flag of the city of Gorzów Wielkopolski in Lubusz Voivodeship, Poland is divided into three equally-sized horizontal stripes, of green, white, and red. The first design of the flag was adopted in 1991, and its current version, in 1994.


== Design ==
The civil flag of the city of Gorzów Wielkopolski is divided into three equally-sized horizontal stripes. They are, from top to bottom, green, white, and red. The colours were based on those of the city coat of arms. The proportions of the flag have the aspect ratio of its height to its wight equal 6:11. The state flag depicts the coat of arms of the city, placed in the centre of the civil flag. The coat of arms consists of the white Iberian style escutcheon (shield) with square top and rounded base. In its centre is placed a red eagle with its head facing left, and spread wings, and a red tongue put out. It has yellow (golden) beak, and clows at its legs. The eagle holds a green clover in each of its legs.


== History ==
The flag was established by the City Council on 6 May 1901. The original design consisted from three equally-sized horizontal stripes. The colours were based on the city coat of arms. They were from top to bottom, red, white, and green. The flag stopped being used in 1945, when the city was transferred to Poland, in the aftermath of World War II. The flag was adopted again by the city on 29 December 1994, with the order of the stripes reversed, to better reflect Polish vexillological tradition.

Picture Post,"Picture Post was a photojournalistic magazine published in the United Kingdom from 1938 to 1957.  It is considered a pioneering example of photojournalism and  was an immediate success, selling 1,700,000 copies a week after only two months. It has been called the UK's equivalent of Life magazine.The magazine’s editorial stance was liberal, anti-fascist, and populist, and from its inception, Picture Post campaigned against the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany. In the 26 November 1938 issue, a picture story was run entitled ""Back to the Middle Ages"": photographs of Adolf Hitler, Joseph Goebbels and Hermann Göring were contrasted with the faces of those scientists, writers and actors they were persecuting.


== History ==
In January 1941 Picture Post published their ""Plan for Britain"". This included minimum wages throughout industry, full employment, child allowances, a national health service, the planned use of land and a complete overhaul of education. This document led to discussions about post-war Britain and was a populist forerunner of William Beveridge's November 1942 Report.
Sales of Picture Post increased further during World War II, and by December 1943, the magazine was selling 1,950,000 copies a week. By the end of 1949 circulation had declined to 1,422,000.
The founding editor, Stefan Lorant (who had also founded Lilliput and had even earlier pioneered the picture-story in Germany in the 1920s), had been succeeded by (Sir) Tom Hopkinson in 1940. Lorant, who was Jewish, had been imprisoned by Hitler in the early 1930s and later wrote a best-selling book, I Was Hitler's Prisoner. By 1940, he feared that he would be captured in a Nazi invasion of Britain and so fled to Massachusetts, where he wrote important illustrated US histories and biographies. 
During World War II, the art editor of the magazine, Edgar Ainsworth, served as a war correspondent and accompanied the American 7th Army on its advance across Europe in 1945. He visited the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp three times after the British army liberated the complex in April 1945. Several of his sketches and drawings from the camp were published in a September 1945 article, Victim and Prisoner. Ainsworth also commissioned the artist Mervyn Peake to visit France and Germany at the end of the war and reported from Bergen-Belsen.Hopkinson said that his photographers were thoroughbreds and that text could always be written after the event, but if his photographers did not come back with good pictures, he had nothing to work with. Years later, Hopkinson said that the greatest photos he ever received to lay out were Bert Hardy's images from the Korean War's Battle of Incheon, for which James Cameron wrote the article. The magazine's greatest photographers included Hardy, Kurt Hutton, Felix H. Man (aka Hans Baumann), Francis Reiss, Thurston Hopkins, John Chillingworth, Grace Robertson, and Leonard McCombe, who eventually joined Life magazine's staff. Staff writers included MacDonald Hastings, Lorna Hay, Sydney Jacobson, J. B. Priestley, Lionel Birch, James Cameron, Fyfe Robertson, Anne Scott-James, Robert Kee and Bert Lloyd. Many freelancer writers contributed as well, including George Bernard Shaw, Dorothy Parker, and William Saroyan.
On 17 June 1950, Leader magazine was incorporated in Picture Post. Editor Tom Hopkinson was often in conflict with (Sir) Edward G. Hulton, the owner of Picture Post. Hulton mainly supported the Conservative Party and objected to Hopkinson's socialist views. The conflict led to Hopkinson's dismissal in 1950 following the publication of Cameron's article, with pictures by Hardy, about South Korea's treatment of political prisoners in the Korean War.
By June 1952, circulation had fallen to 935,000. Sales continued to decline in the face of competition from television and a revolving door of new editors. By the time the magazine closed in July 1957, circulation was less than 600,000 copies a week.
Picture Post was digitised as The Picture Post Historical Archive, 1938–1957 and consists of the complete, fully searchable facsimile archive of the Picture Post. It was made available in 2011 to libraries and institutions.


== Hulton Press Library ==
As the photographic archive of Picture Post expanded through the Second World War, it became clear that its vast collection of photographs and negatives, both published and unpublished, were becoming an important historical documentary resource. In 1945, Sir Edward Hulton set up the Hulton Press Library as a semi-independent operation. He commissioned Charles Gibbs-Smith of the Victoria and Albert Museum to catalogue the entire archive using a system of keywords and classifications. The Gibbs-Smith system was the world’s first indexing system for pictures, and it was eventually adopted by the Victoria and Albert Museum and parts of the British Museum collections.When Picture Post folded, Sir Edward Hulton sold the archive collection to the BBC in 1957. It was incorporated into the Radio Times photo archive, and the BBC expanded the collection further with the purchase of the photo archives of the Daily Express and Evening Standard newspapers. Eventually, the BBC disposed of its photo archive and the BBC Hulton Picture Library was sold on once more, this time to Brian Deutsch, in 1988.  In 1996, the Hulton Picture Collection was bought by Getty Investments for £8.6 million. Getty Images now owns the rights to some 15 million photographs from the British press archives dating back to the 19th century. In 2000, Getty embarked on a large project to digitise the photo archive, and launched a dedicated website in 2001. A data migration programme began in 2003 and the Hulton Archive was transferred to the main Getty Images website; the Hulton Archive is still available today as a featured resource within the vast Getty holdings.


== Present day: Picture Stories ==
A documentary about the life and photographic legacy of Picture Post, Picture Stories, was produced by Ship of Life Films in 2021. 
The documentary features archive interviews with editors Stefan Lorant and Tom Hopkinson and several Picture Post photographers, including Bert Hardy, Thurston Hopkins, John Chillingworth,  Humphrey Spender and David Steen. It also includes the photographer Grace Robertson's last interview, in which she discusses her classic picture story ""Mother's Day Off"". Modern-day documentary photographers including David Hurn, Daniel Meadows, Anna Fox, Homer Sykes, Peter Dench and Nick Turpin discuss the photography and influence of Picture Post.
Picture Stories received positive reviews and won the Audience Award at the 2021 UK Jewish Film Festival. The Guardian gave the documentary a four-star review, describing it as ""inspiring"".

Slingsby Falcon,"The Slingsby T.1/T.2 Falcon or British Falcon) was a single-seat sport glider produced, in 1931–37, by Fred Slingsby in Scarborough, Yorkshire.


== Design and development ==
The Falcon was constructed from plans supplied by the Rhön-Rossitten Gesellschaft (the controlling body for gliding in Germany). Originally designed by Alexander Lippisch, the T.1 was a single-seat sport glider of moderate performance for its day. The fuselage was primarily of wooden construction with six longerons, built-up frames, plywood skinning forward of the central pylon and fabric covering aft. The parasol wings were conventional in design and construction with built-up ribs and spars, plywood covering forward of the main spars and fabric aft.  They were swept at 12.5o but carried ailerons with unswept hinges and rounded trailing edges.  The wings were built in two parts joined at the centre, supported by a pylon and a total of eight struts, four vertical from the top longerons and four in vee pairs from the bottom longerons to approx 1/3-span. The tail surfaces were constructed in a similar fashion also braced with struts.


== History ==
Fred Slingsby had noticed the lack of 'Intermediate' gliders available in England. At the recommendation of Guenther Groenhoff he acquired the plans for Lippisch's Falke and built ten aircraft: the Falcon, Falcon 2 and eight further Falcons (a.k.a. British Falcon). These aircraft were flown successfully for many years, but gradually succumbed until none were left airworthy. One was exported to Canada, and one was converted to a flying-boat glider for use by the Air Training Corps on Windermere, surviving to this day in the Windermere Steamboat Museum. During 1984-5 Ken Fripp of Southdown Aero Services at Lasham built a reproduction Falcon from original plans for Mike Russell, bringing the total built to eleven.

Tropical Storm Zelda (1991),"Severe Tropical Storm Zelda was the last tropical cyclone of the 1991 Pacific typhoon season; it struck the Marshall Islands on November 28.  The area of low pressure that eventually became Zelda formed near the International Date Line, and strengthened into a tropical depression on November 27.  The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) reported that the depression had reached tropical storm intensity near the Marshall Islands on November 28, thus naming it Zelda. On November 29, the storm quickly strengthened to 65 knots (120 km/h; 75 mph) according to the JTWC, equivalent to a Category 1 typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale.  It reached a peak of 80 kn (150 km/h; 90 mph) according to the JTWC, and 60 kn (110 km/h; 70 mph) according to the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA), with a barometric pressure of 975 hectopascals (28.8 inHg).  Zelda weakened into a tropical storm on December 2, and then a tropical depression two days later.  The JTWC discontinued warnings late on December 4, while the JMA declared the storm to be extratropical the next day and continued to track until it crossed the International Date Line again on December 7.
Zelda caused significant damage in the Marshall Islands, and operations at Kwajalein Missile Range were disrupted severely.  No deaths or injuries were reported. About 60 percent of homes were destroyed in Ebeye Island, leaving 6,000 people without residence.  Nearly all crops on the islands were destroyed, and food and other supplies were contaminated by salt.  Later in December, the president of the United States, George H. W. Bush declared the storm to be a major disaster, allowing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to assist with funding and repairs.  The Marshall Islands also requested funds from other countries.


== Meteorological history ==
Westerly winds near the equator – associated with an ongoing El Niño event – assisted in spawning a weak area of low pressure in late November 1991 near the International Date Line. The JTWC began tracking the area on the Significant Tropical Weather Advisory at 06:00 UTC on November 25. Vertical wind shear prevented strengthening at first, but the disturbance continued to develop. A tropical cyclone formation alert from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) soon followed. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started tracking the disturbance at 06:00 UTC on November 27, and the JTWC issued their first warning 18 hours later on the depression, naming it 31W. The depression quickly intensified, and it was designated a tropical storm at 00:00 UTC on November 28 by the JTWC, with winds of 35 knots (65 km/h; 40 mph). Operationally, the storm was upgraded twenty-four hours later and given the name Zelda, after Kwajalein received stronger winds than expected. The JTWC attributed the delay to the small size of the storm, the poorly organized outflow, and the lack of visible and infrared image pairs for analysis. The JMA upgraded the storm at 03:00 UTC on November 29, then to a severe tropical storm eighteen hours later. The JTWC reported that Zelda intensified into a typhoon at 12:00 UTC near the Marshall Islands, with winds of 65 kn (120 km/h; 75 mph), equivalent to a Category 1 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. At that time, the JMA kept it as a tropical storm with winds of 45 kn (85 km/h; 50 mph), with a pressure reading of 990 hectopascals (29 inHg).Around 06:00 UTC on November 30, the JMA estimated Zelda had reached its peak at 60 kn (110 km/h; 70 mph), with a barometric pressure of 975 hPa (28.8 inHg). Six hours later, the JTWC reported the storm had strengthened to maximum sustained winds of 80 kn (150 km/h; 90 mph), west of Enewetak. Later, a trough created by Typhoon Yuri caused the subtropical ridge to weaken, allowing Zelda to move northward. By December 1, the storm began to weaken and turned northeast. On December 2, the JMA reported the storm's winds had decreased to 50 kn (95 km/h; 60 mph). The JTWC reported the storm weakened below typhoon strength on 18:00 UTC of the same day, with winds of 60 kn (110 km/h; 70 mph). Upper-level winds and westerlies soon increased, and Zelda's central convection became sheared. The JMA downgraded Zelda to a tropical storm on December 3, and to a tropical depression later that day. A few hours later, the JTWC downgraded the storm to a tropical depression, as it unexpectedly turned to the northwest. The low-level circulation of the storm detached from the cold front, and the JTWC issued the last warning of the year. The depression turned back northeast, the JMA declared the storm to be extratropical on December 5, and the agency stopped tracking it just past the International Date Line on December 7. Remnants of the storm moved inland into northern British Columbia by December 8.


== Impact and aftermath ==
Zelda was the first of three storms to strike the Marshall Islands within one year, just before Axel and Gay in 1992. The storm affected Marshall Islands on November 28, producing sustained winds ranging from 120–160 km/h (75–100 mph). The storm impacted islands of Kwajalein, Majuro, Lae, Wotho, and Eniwetok. Kwajalein Missile Range, which was used in Strategic Defense Initiative testing, caught stronger winds than expected from the storm, affecting operations at the missile range.  A pressure of 990.1 hPa (29.24 inHg) was recorded on Kwajalein, which was the lowest pressure recorded on the atoll at that time. On Ebeye Island, 60 percent of homes made of plywood and sheet-iron roofs were destroyed by the storm, and 6,000 people were left homeless. Food and water supplies were contaminated from salt in storm surge, and the water desalination plant became inoperable. Power lines were cut across the island. There were no deaths or significant injuries. Other islands in the nation had their water contaminated by saltwater, and 95 percent of the crops were destroyed by the storm surge.  Coral reefs were also heavily damaged when the storm came nearby. As an extratropical cyclone, Zelda bought heavy rain and 110 km/h (70 mph) winds to Southeast Alaska. Heavy snow was reported in northern British Columbia, and lesser amounts inland British Columbia and southern Yukon.The United States Army engaged in clean up and repairing in the country. On December 6, the 834th Airlift Division sent six C-130s to Kwajalein with supplies. On the same day, President of the United States George H. W. Bush, through the Compact of Free Association, declared a major disaster in the Marshall Islands, allowing federal funding to be sent to the Arno, Aur, Kwajalein, Lae, Lib, Namu and Ujae islands. United States Senator Daniel Akaka visited Ebeye after the storm, and he criticized the response of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as the funding did not cover repairing of structures regarded as substandard. The Government of the Marshall Islands requested for aid via United Nations Disaster Relief Organization (UNDRO) on December 18. By December 19, 1,380 people were still living in temporary shelters.By March 26, 1992, about $98,000 (1992 USD, equivalent to $204,366 in 2022) worth of relief goods were sent to the Marshall Islands from UNDRO, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and Government of Australia. FEMA sent $1.518 million (1992 USD, equivalent to $3,165,590 in 2022) to affected families. Critical infrastructure in Ebeye were repaired by the Kwajalein Atoll Development Authority by November 1992.

Caritas Charles Vath College,"Caritas Charles Vath College (Chinese: 明愛華德中書院), abbreviated as CCVC, is a secondary school located at Tung Chung, Lantau Island, Hong Kong operated under the Direct Subsidy Scheme (DSS) of the Education Bureau. It is a secondary school sponsored by the Caritas Hong Kong established in 2003, with the current principal Mr. Wong Wai.The school offers the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education course (HKDSE) as a ladder for students to continue their studies. The courses are divided into three major categories, including art and design, Tourism and hospitality, and business, which let students choose more heuristic and multiple disciplinary subjects in addition to regular curriculum.


== History ==
Mr. Charles Vath was the director of the Hong Kong Catholic Center, and the founder and president of Caritas Hong Kong since 1953. Caritas Hong Kong believes in caring for love and creating hope.Until the 2000s, a group of Form 3 students were taken from every school without promoting to Form 4. Then there were a large number of Form 5 students leaving the school after Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination (HKCEE). Under the past elitism system, students with poor academic performance would be eliminated. These students also had the right to receive education. Hong Kong's support for high school students is quite inadequate. This was also the reason for the appearance of senior high school in those years, which only admit students of Form 4 or above.Caritas Charles Vath College is a DSS high school that was funded by the government in 2003. The school is a senior high school in Hong Kong, which mainly runs Form 4 and above. Before the implementation of the new high school curriculum, the students needed to go through the HKCEE and Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination (HKALE). During the two public examinations, many students became victims of the system and lost the opportunity to go directly to senior forms in the original school. For the students who intend to continue their studies, Caritas Charles Vath College's senior secondary courses opened up another path. In the past, the school provided a series of one-year professional certificate courses including the HKCEE, the HKALE.After 2012, it changed to provide the HKDSE courses, as well as other courses covering tourism, cosmetology, design, electronics certificate courses.In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, classes were suspended and students were confined to distance education. Online learning was performed throughout the school period for all subjects.The emergence of the HKDSE has brought shocks to the school. The school transformed. Starting from the 2020/2021 school year, the school set up junior high form classes. However, the school pays special attention to the purpose of helping the most lost and unsaved students did not change.


== Campus environment ==
The school is located at North Lantau New Town in Tung Chung, Lantau Island. It is adjacent to Mun Tung Estate and YMCA of Hong Kong Christian College.The school covers an area of about 7,600 square meters. There is an isolated greenhouse in the school campus.In additional to the regular classrooms in the teaching building, the school is equipped with different recreation rooms such as a dancing room, an English corner, a studio and a chapel. Other special rooms include a Cosmetology room, an MMLC, an Art room, an Animation room and an interactive computer room etc.


== School characteristics ==


=== Practical school ===
The school offers Experience Based Learning certificate courses, i.e. experiential learning and work-based learning courses such as tourism, design, cosmetology, SOHO digital entertainment, performing arts, consumer electronics, tour guide, leadership, property management, fitness training, social services, web design, hotels and hospitality, women's quality management, manicure, hand-made ornaments, emerging sports, hand-made model skills, fluid dynamics and volunteering, etc.

Jacques Moderne,"Jacques Moderne - Giacomo Moderno (Pinguente, Istria [now Buzet, Croatia], c.1495–1500 – Lyons, after 1560) was an Italian-born music publisher active in France in the Renaissance Era.
Moderne was the second printer to publish music on a large scale in France using the single-impression method. The first one was Pierre Attaingnant (c. 1494–1551/2) of Paris, who began issuing his music books in 1527/8.
Although Moderne is nowadays known as a music publisher, which was a major part of his production and the part that brought him the greatest renown, he printed about one hundred books of several themes, such as religion, home remedies, palmistry, among others.

Wigan Athletic F.C.,"Wigan Athletic Football Club () is an English professional football club based in Wigan, Greater Manchester, England, that competes in the EFL League One, the third tier of English football, following relegation from the 2022–23 EFL Championship.
Founded in 1932, they have played at the 25,138-seat DW Stadium since 1999, before which they played at Springfield Park. Their colours are blue and white stripes, although all-blue shirts have been common throughout the club's history. The club regards Bolton Wanderers as its primary derby rival. Wigan competed in the Cheshire County League for the first nine seasons of the club's existence, winning three league titles before being placed in the Lancashire Combination in 1947. It spent 14 years in the Lancashire Combination and secured four league titles during this time. It spent 1961 to 1968 back in the Cheshire County League, picking up another league title in 1964–65. Invited to become a founder member of the Northern Premier League in 1968, the club won two league titles and also reached the FA Trophy final in 1973. Wigan was elected to the Football League in 1978 and was promoted out of the Fourth Division in 1981–82. The club won the Associate Members' Cup in 1985, but was relegated back into the fourth tier in 1993. It won the Third Division title in 1996–97, the Football League Trophy in 1999 and the Second Division in 2002–03, before securing promotion out of the Championship in 2004–05.
Wigan was the beaten finalist in the League Cup in 2006 and won the FA Cup in 2013, beating Manchester City in the Final. However, the club was relegated later that year, bringing its eight-season stay in the Premier League to an end. The FA Cup success did, though, gain it a place in the UEFA Europa League group stages the following season. Relegated from the Championship in 2015, the club won the League One title in 2015–16 and repeated this feat in 2017–18 after another relegation. On 1 July 2020, less than a month after a change of ownership, it was placed into administration and was relegated from the Championship due to the subsequent points deduction. After narrowly avoiding relegation to League Two in 2020–21 under new ownership, Wigan won the League One title for a fourth time in 2021–22, but a year later were again relegated from the Championship following two further points deductions. Additional deductions of points were made in May 2023, meaning the club would start the 2023–24 League One season with minus eight points.


== History ==


=== Non-league football: 1932–1978 ===
Wigan Athletic was formed in 1932, following the winding-up of Wigan Borough the year before. The establishment of Wigan Athletic was the sixth attempt to create a stable football club in the town following the demise of Wigan A.F.C., Wigan County, Wigan United, Wigan Town and Wigan Borough. The town's die-hard football enthusiasts planned the rebirth of a town team, and a public meeting was held at the Queen's Hall presided over by the then Mayor of Wigan, Councillor W.A. Hipwood, and Callum Roper, who called on the town to keep up its reputation for producing fine sportsmen by keeping intact an Association Football team as well as the Rugby League team. A committee was elected and a new club was formed, Wigan Athletic. Springfield Park, the former home of Wigan Borough, was purchased by the club for £2,850 from the owners of the Woodhouse Lane dog track. Despite their initial application being turned down, Wigan Athletic were elected into the Cheshire County League following the resignation of Manchester Central. The club had also made the first of many attempts to be admitted into the Football League, but failed to receive a single vote. On 27 August 1932, Wigan Athletic played their first-ever league game against Port Vale Reserves. The team played in red and white shirts with black shorts.Wigan Athletic won its first honours in the 1933–34 season, finishing top of the Cheshire League, despite being based in neighbouring Lancashire. In the following season the club won a second league championship and also entered the FA Cup for the first time, defeating Carlisle United 6–1 in the first round – a cup record for the biggest victory by a non-league club over a league club. In the 1935–36 season, the club won its third consecutive Cheshire League title and the Lancashire Junior Cup.
After the Second World War, Wigan Athletic adopted their present-day blue and white colours. The club struggled to assemble a competitive side and finished bottom of the league in 1946–47 season. Despite their pre-war success, the club failed to gain re-election and was replaced by Winsford United. The club joined the Lancashire Combination, winning the league in their first season. In 1950, Wigan Athletic came close to election to The Football League, narrowly losing out to Scunthorpe United and Shrewsbury Town. The club would frequently apply for election to the Football League over the next 28 years before finally being accepted.
In the 1953–54 season, Wigan played an FA Cup match against Hereford United in front of a crowd of 27,526 – a club record and also a record attendance for a match between two non-league teams at a non-league ground. In the next round of the cup, Wigan Athletic was drawn against First Division side Newcastle United. Wigan Athletic held their top-flight opponents to a 2–2 draw at St James' Park, but went on to lose the replay 3–2. In 1961, the club moved back to the Cheshire League.
In the 1964–65 season, Wigan Athletic won its first Cheshire League title since returning to the league, with top goalscorer Harry Lyon scoring 66 times. He remains the club's greatest goalscorer of all time. Wigan Athletic won four cup titles in the 1966–67 season (Lancashire Floodlit Cup winner, Liverpool Non League Senior Cup winner, Northern Floodlit League winner, Northern Floodlit League Cup winner) and was also Cheshire County League runner-up.In 1968, Wigan Athletic was a founder member of the Northern Premier League. In winning the league title in 1970–71, the leading goalscorer, with 42 goals including seven hat-tricks, was Geoff Davies, who scored 28 goals in the following 1971–72 season. The team played at Wembley Stadium for the first time in the 1973 FA Trophy Final, where they lost 2–1 to Scarborough. After 34 failed election attempts, including one controversial but headline-making application in 1972 to join the Scottish League Second Division, Wigan Athletic was elected to the Football League in 1978.


=== Early league years: 1978–1995 ===

Wigan Athletic finished in second place in the Northern Premier League in the 1977–78 season, behind winners Boston United. But as Boston's ground and facilities did not meet the Football League criteria for a League club, whereas Springfield Park did, Wigan Athletic were put forward for election to the league. There was no automatic promotion to the Football League until 1987, and at that time a club had to be 'voted out' of the League to allow a non-league team to be promoted in their place. At the end of the 1977–78 season, Southport finished next to the bottom of the old Fourth Division, and faced near neighbours Wigan Athletic for their place in the league. The first round of voting was tied, with both clubs receiving 26 votes. After a tense re-vote which Wigan won 29–20, Southport lost their place in the Fourth Division and Wigan Athletic became an English League club on 2 June 1978.In the club's first season of league football, Wigan Athletic finished in sixth place, just six points off promotion and playing in front of an average crowd of 6,701. Two more top-half finishes came in the following seasons, though a relatively weak 1980–81 season saw the dismissal of long-serving manager Ian McNeill shortly before the end of the season. They gained their first Football League promotion under the management of former Liverpool player Larry Lloyd in 1981–82, when a points tally of 91 saw them join the former Division Three for the first time, beginning a 10-year spell in English football's third tier. The club struggled in their first season in Division Three, which led to Lloyd's sacking in early 1983, at which point Bobby Charlton, a director at the time, took over as temporary manager before being replaced by Harry McNally. Under McNally's management, the club stabilised in Division Three and secured a pair of mid-table finishes, but a dreadful 1984–85 season cost him his job, with Tranmere manager Bryan Hamilton stepping into the breach. Under Hamilton's management, the club's performances went to the next level and they won their first silverware as a league club that season with the Freight Rover Trophy. They were beaten in the Northern final of the same competition the following season by Bolton Wanderers. More importantly, Hamilton achieved Division Three survival, which had looked an impossible task earlier that season.

The 1985–86 season saw a marked improvement in the club's league form, eventually finishing in fourth position, a then-club record high which would stand for 17 years until 2002–03. Wigan Athletic finished the season just one point outside the promotion places in the final season before the Football League introduced the play-off system for promotion and relegation. However, Hamilton's feats attracted the attention of First Division Leicester City and he left to become their manager in the summer of 1986. His assistant, Ray Mathias, who had followed him from Tranmere, stepped up to the Wigan Athletic manager's job. Wigan Athletic managed an identical fourth-place finish in the 1986–87 season, but this time were rewarded with the chance to compete for the final promotion place in the new play-off system. (In the first two years of the play-off system, teams finishing third, fourth and fifth joined the team finishing 20th in the division above to play-off for the promotion place; this was changed to the teams finishing third, fourth, fifth and sixth from the 1988–89 season). The Latics lost at the two-legged semi-final stage to Swindon, who went on to win the final promotion place.
The fourth-place finishes of the 1985–86 and 1986–87 seasons proved to be the high points of Wigan Athletic's first stint in Division 3. For the next five years, they finished mid-table, flirting with relegation in 1988–89 (at which time Mathias was sacked and the previous manager Bryan Hamilton returned) and 1989–90, until they were relegated for the first time in the club's league history in 1992–93. Wigan Athletic finished in 23rd place, amid tumbling attendances which had fallen from averages of 3,000–4,000 in Wigan Athletic's Division 3 years to just 2,593 in 1992–93. Hamilton resigned shortly before the club were relegated, and was replaced by Kenny Swain. A year later, with the club back in the fourth tier of the English League, the Latics finished fourth from bottom, in 19th place. While there was no relegation that season due to the lack of a promotable club in the Football Conference, this remains the club's lowest-ever finish. The following season would prove to be arguably even worse, as Swain was sacked early in the campaign following a horrific start, and former player Graham Barrow took over as manager. Despite the club being rooted to the bottom of the table until the start of December, the second half of the campaign saw a major upturn in form, and they finished well clear of the relegation zone in 15th place. Attendances fell to a lowest-ever Wigan Athletic League average of 1,845 by 1995.


=== Rising through the league: 1995–2005 ===
In February 1995, local millionaire and owner of JJB Sports, Dave Whelan purchased the club. Through Whelan's business connections in Spain he attracted three Spaniards to the club – Roberto Martínez, Isidro Díaz, and Jesus Seba – who became known as the Three Amigos. The trio became the on-pitch symbols of Whelan's ambitious plan to take Wigan Athletic into the Premier League. The Three Amigos were joined at the club by John Deehan, who replaced Barrow as manager during the 1995–96 season following a 6–2 home defeat to Mansfield Town. Deehan took the Latics within two points of a play-off place in his first season; the club had in fact been in the final automatic promotion spot with four games remaining, but lost them all and so failed to even make the playoffs. The following year Wigan Athletic became Division Three champions on the last day of the season, Graeme Jones scoring a club record 31 league goals in the process. In most seasons they would have been runners-up, but a temporary rule change which saw goals scored take precedence over goal difference allowed them to finish above runners-up Fulham, who had the same number of points and a better goal difference.
Following a mid-table finish in Division Two the following season, Deehan quit to become Steve Bruce's assistant at Sheffield United. He was succeeded by Ray Mathias, who returned for his third stint as Wigan Athletic manager. Mathias' team won the Football League Trophy in 1999, beating Millwall 1–0 at Wembley Stadium. The same season the Latics reached the Division Two play-offs, losing 2–1 on aggregate to Manchester City. Mathias was sacked, and replaced by John Benson. He led the team to the top of Division Two in his first six months, but they were only able to qualify for the play-offs. In the last Division Two play-off final played at the old Wembley Stadium, Wigan lost 3–2 after extra time to Gillingham.
Benson moved 'upstairs' to the new post of director of football in the summer of 2000, when former Arsenal manager Bruce Rioch took the manager's job for the 2000–01 season. Rioch was hampered by severe injury problems and after a difficult and often unimpressive first half of the season left the club in February 2001. He was temporarily replaced by club stalwart Colin Greenall, before the surprise appointment of Steve Bruce for the final eight games of the season. His arrival brought renewed vigour to Wigan Athletic performances, but the club ultimately lost in the play-offs again, this time against Reading, and Bruce left for Crystal Palace.
In the summer of 2001, the former Latics forward Paul Jewell took over as manager following an unsuccessful spell at Sheffield Wednesday. His first season in charge saw mixed results and an embarrassing defeat to non-league Canvey Island in the FA Cup first round, although the club eventually finished in mid-table. Jewell's second season in charge was far more successful. Wigan Athletic went on a run to the quarter-finals of the League Cup, beating Premier League opponents West Brom, Manchester City and Fulham en route. Wigan Athletic won the Division Two championship in 2002–03 with a points total of 100, powered by the goals of then-record £1.2 million signing Nathan Ellington, with a run of 10 consecutive wins along the way. The club lost only four times all season, and Wigan Athletic secured promotion to the second tier of the English Football League for the first time in their history.
After losing their first Division One game, Wigan Athletic confounded expectations to go unbeaten for the next 17 games and topped the division by November 2003. A weak finish saw Wigan Athletic win only three of their last 10 games to finish seventh in Division One – a last-minute goal by West Ham's Brian Deane in the final game of the season saw the Latics drop out of the play-off places in favour of eventual play-off winners Crystal Palace.
Hoping to build on the previous season's disappointing finish, the Latics went one better than 2003–04 by remaining unbeaten for the first 17 games of the 2004–05 season. Along with Sunderland and Ipswich, the Latics remained in the promotion hunt all season. By the last day of the season, Sunderland had already won the title and Wigan needed at least a draw against Reading – who themselves needed to win to finish in sixth place – to beat Ipswich to the last automatic promotion spot. A 3–1 victory at the JJB Stadium earned Wigan Athletic promotion to the top division of English football for the first time in their 73-year history.


=== Premier League years and FA Cup victory: 2005–2013 ===
The club's first Premier League game was a sell-out at the JJB Stadium against holders Chelsea, a 1–0 defeat after an injury-time winner by Hernán Crespo. A successful run followed, and by November, Wigan were second in the league. Good league form was coupled with an equally strong performance in the Football League Cup, with Wigan reaching their first ever major cup final after defeating Arsenal on away goals in the semi-final. In the final, Wigan were defeated 4–0 by neighbours Manchester United. Wigan Athletic eventually finished the season in 10th place, which remains the club's highest ever league placing. Defender Pascal Chimbonda was also included in the 2005–06 PFA Team of the Season, capping off his season by being picked for the France squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
During the close season, Wigan sold many players who had starred in their first season in the Premier League, such as Jimmy Bullard, Jason Roberts and Stéphane Henchoz, while bringing in replacements including Emile Heskey, Denny Landzaat, Chris Kirkland and Antonio Valencia. After a mid-table start to the 2006–07 season, Wigan had eight consecutive losses from mid-December, but was 15th in early March. On the final day of the season, Wigan got a 2–1 away win against Sheffield United, which kept them up at the expense of their opponents. The following day, Paul Jewell unexpectedly resigned as manager; his assistant Chris Hutchings was appointed as his replacement.
Wigan's third Premier League campaign saw changes in the squad, with Titus Bramble, Mario Melchiot, Jason Koumas and Marcus Bent among the players brought in, and Melchiot was installed as the new club captain.  The 2007–08 season began well for Wigan, with Emile Heskey recalled to the England squad, as the first Wigan player to represent England whilst a full member of the club. However, he broke his foot immediately after his England call-up and was out injured for six weeks. The club's league position subsequently worsened, and on the back of a run of six consecutive defeats, Wigan fell into the relegation zone. Whelan took the decision to sack Hutchings on 5 November 2007, after 12 games in charge, reinstating Bruce, who saved the club from relegation.
In the summer of 2008, Bruce signed Lee Cattermole from Middlesbrough for £3.5 million, and Egyptian striker Amr Zaki sign on an initial one-year loan. Zaki had scored 10 Premier League goals by February 2009, as Wigan reached seventh place in the table with 34 points from 25 games. January saw the departure of two key first team members, Wilson Palacios and Emile Heskey, to Tottenham and Aston Villa respectively. Despite these changes, Wigan finished the season in 11th place with 45 points, their second-best finish ever in the Premier League. On 3 June, Bruce left Wigan for the second time to take over the vacant manager position at Sunderland. July saw the departure of another key first team member Antonio Valencia to Manchester United. Before the 2009–10 season got underway, Cattermole left for Sunderland.

Wigan appointed Roberto Martínez, then manager of Swansea City, as manager prior to the 2009–10 Premier League season. He previously played for Wigan from 1995 to 2001. On 26 September, they claimed their first three points against a ""Big 4"" team after beating Chelsea 3–1, with goals from Titus Bramble, Hugo Rodallega and Paul Scharner. A late surge that included a 1–0 win over Liverpool and a 3–2 win over Arsenal – the latter of which saw Wigan recover from two goals down with ten minutes remaining to win in injury time – saw the team once more survive relegation. Most notably, having never defeated any of the traditional ""Big Four"" in the league until their win over Chelsea (and with only one win over any of them in cup competitions), Wigan ended the season having defeated three of them at home. Despite this high, the season also saw two humiliating 8 goal defeats, firstly a 9–1 thrashing at Tottenham in November, and finally an 8–0 defeat to Chelsea on the final day of the season, a match which saw their opponents crowned Premier League champions.In the 2010–11 season, Wigan fell to the bottom of the league by the end of February, following a 4–0 defeat to Manchester United. However, despite remaining in the bottom three for the majority of the season, they managed to retain their Premier League status on the last day of the season, defeating Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium after a goal from Hugo Rodallega. On 7 May 2012, they simultaneously secured their Premier League status and relegated Blackburn Rovers with a 1–0 victory at Ewood Park.

In 2013, after beating Everton in the quarter-final and Millwall in the semi-final, Wigan reached the FA Cup Final for the first time in their history. In the final, played at Wembley Stadium, Wigan beat Manchester City 1–0, with a goal by Ben Watson scored in injury time.
Wigan's first ever major trophy also gave the club a place in the group stage of the Europa League. Following their 4–1 defeat to Arsenal three days later, Wigan Athletic ended their eight-year spell in the Premier League and became the first team to be relegated and win the FA Cup in the same season. On 5 June it was announced that Martínez had left Wigan and had signed for Everton on a four-year deal.


=== End of the Whelan era: 2013–2018 ===
Owen Coyle became the new manager of Wigan Athletic when Martínez left for Everton. The team lost to Manchester United in the Community Shield. Coyle left by mutual agreement on 2 December 2013 after a poor start to the season, and was replaced by Uwe Rösler. On 12 December in his first match, Wigan were eliminated from the Europa League group stage after defeat to Maribor. On 9 March 2014 Wigan beat Manchester City in the 6th Round of the FA Cup to reach the semi-final at Wembley for the second successive year, where they played Arsenal, and lost 2–4 on penalties after normal time and extra time resulted in a 1–1 draw. After finishing 5th in the Championship, Wigan lost their play-off semi-final to Queens Park Rangers.Rösler was sacked in November 2014 with the club in the relegation places, and was replaced by Malky Mackay. Whelan resigned as chairman on 3 March 2015, remaining as owner but handing over the chairmanship to his grandson David Sharpe. The following month, with Wigan in danger of relegation to League One, Mackay was sacked and replaced by former Wigan captain Gary Caldwell, yet the team ended the season with relegation. The squad changed drastically, including the signings of Will Grigg from Brentford and Reece James from Manchester United. The side lost only once in 23 matches in the second half of the season and won the division, with Grigg the league's top scorer with 25 goals.
In October 2016, following a poor start to the season, Caldwell was sacked as manager and replaced by Manchester United coach Warren Joyce. Results did not improve under Joyce, who was sacked in March 2017. Wigan were subsequently relegated back to League One in April and interim manager Graham Barrow left, ending a 15-year association with the club. Paul Cook, who had just won League Two with Portsmouth, was appointed Wigan manager in June 2017.In the 2017–18 League One season, Wigan finished top winning promotion back to the Championship. Their promotion was sealed by a 4–0 win against Fleetwood Town. In the 2017–18 FA Cup, Wigan beat Manchester City in the Fifth Round Proper at home, winning 1–0 after Will Grigg scored in the 79th minute. In the quarterfinals, they were knocked out by Southampton in a 2–0 loss. At the end of the season it was announced that the Whelan family had agreed a deal to sell the club, stadium and training facilities to the Hong Kong-based International Entertainment Corporation (IEC) in a £22m deal. On 2 November 2018, IEC received shareholder approval to complete the acquisition of the football club, ending 23 years of Whelan family ownership.In the 2018–19 season, Wigan finished 18th in the Championship with 52 points, well clear of the relegation zone.


=== Administration, relegation, and bouncing back: 2020–2022 ===
On 4 June 2020, IEC sold the majority of Wigan Athletic shareholdings to Hong Kong-based Next Leader Fund; the sale was formally ratified and approved by the shareholders of IEC, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the EFL. On 1 July 2020, the club – standing 14th in the Championship, eight points clear of relegation, in a season delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic – announced it had gone into administration as Next Leader Fund had refused to invest promised money. Paul Stanley, Gerald Krasner and Dean Watson from Begbies Traynor were appointed as joint administrators. The insolvency left Wigan facing a 12-point deduction; the sanction would be applied at the end of the 2019–20 season if the club finished outside the bottom three after 46 games. On 2 July 2020, the administrators said they would investigate how the club ended up in administration less than a month after it changed owners. A private conversation about Wigan's situation involving EFL chairman Rick Parry was secretly filmed amid talk of betting on Wigan being relegated – described by some as the greatest sporting scandal of modern times. Wigan MP Lisa Nandy and Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham wrote a joint letter to Parry calling for an investigation into the club's takeover. Players had not been paid and there was talk of club staff being made redundant and of players being offered for sale, they said. Wigan's supporters club also called for an investigation and for financial support from the EFL; supporters, backed by Nandy, later launched an online petition to try to trigger a parliamentary debate around the EFL's owners' and directors' test.On 4 July, Wigan, previously unbeaten in nine games, lost 3–0 at Brentford. Three days later, 75 (approximately half) of the club's non-playing staff were made redundant by the administrators, and Wigan Warriors expressed interest in buying the football club (a move later supported by Wigan council). On 10 July, midfielder Jensen Weir was set to be sold to Brighton & Hove Albion for £500,000 plus add-ons to help alleviate Wigan's financial problems; England Under-16 international midfielder Alfie Devine was later sold to Tottenham. Bids were due by 21 July; on 22 July (the day of Wigan's final game of the season), Krasner said administrators had received five offers and identified an unnamed preferred bidder; they were seeking completion of the sale by 31 July. However, on 24 July, talks with the preferred bidder broke down and administrators began negotiations with other parties, which continued into early August.Meanwhile, on 7 July 2020 the club had appealed against the 12-point deduction imposed by the EFL for entering administration. On 14 July, Wigan recorded their biggest League victory, beating Hull City 8–0. This, combined with other results, meant Wigan would not finish in the relegation places, so the 12-point deduction would be applied at the end of the current season. Wigan's appeal against the points deduction, heard on 31 July, was set to cost the club between £400,000 and £500,000. Wigan drew 1–1 against Fulham in their final game of the season; the 12-point deduction pushed Wigan into the bottom three, meaning the club would play in League One if its appeal was unsuccessful. On 4 August, the club's relegation was confirmed and, following the resignation of manager Paul Cook, Leam Richardson was appointed caretaker manager.On 17 August 2020, it was reported that Au Yeung Wai Kay, the club's owner, had, on 23 June, asked Begbies Traynor about putting it into administration before completing his takeover. Begbies Traynor disputed the account, produced by an independent commission, saying administration was one of several scenarios discussed. The commission said Kay was ""not open"" with Wigan officials about his conversation with Begbies Traynor, and subsequently gave ""either false or knowingly misleading"" assurances about future funding. The administrator was still attempting to find a buyer; if no agreement was reached by 31 August, Begbies Traynor said it would have to consider whether the club can be funded into the 2020–21 season, due to start on Saturday 12 September 2020. On 20 August, Kay was reported to be waiving a £36m debt owed to him by the club in an effort to expedite its sale. Wigan supporters began a fund-raising effort, initially raising £500,000 to help secure the club's future, and then raising £200,000 more. Administrators had been confident a sale would be agreed by their deadline, but later revised their opinion.On 9 September 2020, with the club's situation set to be discussed at an EFL meeting, the administrators were reportedly ""quietly optimistic"" about Wigan being allowed to start the EFL season despite being ownerless. They appointed John Sheridan as the club's new manager, who was in charge as Wigan lost their first League game of the season 2–0 at Ipswich Town. On 21 September, the administrators reported that bids would need to top £3m to secure the sale as the club had a ""considerable liability"" to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), owed wages to players, and also had to pay for August's unsuccessful appeal against the points deduction.
On 30 September, the administrators said they had reached an agreement with an unnamed bidder from Spain to purchase the club, and were working on paperwork to gain EFL approval. In early November, former Wigan manager Roberto Martinez was reported to assisting with the Spanish bid. On 13 November, after three wins in 15 Wigan games, manager Sheridan left to become Swindon Town's new manager. On 20 November, additional time was granted to the prospective new owners to complete their purchase. In early December, with the club bottom of League One, it emerged that a member of the Spanish consortium had a disqualifying condition, so Wigan's administrators had to make a fresh application to the EFL on behalf of Felipe Moreno, owner of Spanish LaLiga 2 side Leganés. However, on 5 January 2021, the Moreno take-over bid fell through; administrators began talking to other bidders, with, on 15 January 11 parties said to be interested in buying the club. By early March 2021, the administrators were in advanced talks with a consortium, Phoenix 2021 Ltd, led by Bahrain businessmen Abdulrahman Al-Jasmi and Talal Mubarak al-Hammad, and a takeover was agreed on 15 March, subject to EFL approval and finalisation of paperwork. Under the proposed deal, Al-Hammad would become chairman, and Mal Brannigan (previously involved with Dundalk and Dundee United) would be chief executive. EFL approval for the takeover was confirmed on 30 March 2021. In May, the former administrators repaid £171,000 raised by supporters to keep the club going when it first went into administration.The club finished the 2020–21 season in 20th position, one point above the relegation places. Wigan Athletic won the League One title in 2021–22, earning promotion back to the Championship after a final day 3–0 victory at Shrewsbury Town.


=== 2023: Financial issues, relegation and a new owner ===
On 7 March 2023, Wigan reported a £7.7m loss for the financial year to June 2022. Four days later, Wigan released a statement saying there would be a temporary delay in meeting wage obligations due to liquidity issues; the EFL was aware of the situation and on 20 March 2023, bottom-of-the-table Wigan were docked three points for failing to pay players, having had a previous EFL sanction for non-payment suspended. The club and its owner, Al-Jasmi, also faced new charges. Player Steven Caulker accused the club's leadership of lying and ""absolutely scandalous"" behaviour regarding four late wages payments, and team-mates did not train on 24 March in protest at the club's financial crisis. Later that day, Wigan chairman Talal Al-Hammad announced players had been paid, and said CEO Mal Brannigan had left the club. On 29 April 2023, Wigan were relegated from the Championship. Several players' April wages were again paid late - the fifth time this had happened during the season - and the delays continued into mid-May with the Professional Footballers' Association helping ""frustrated and angry"" players. On 16 May 2023, the club's owners paid a ""substantial"" seven-figure amount, with proof shown to the EFL, to keep the club going and ensure all wages were paid.In late May 2023, Wigan were hit with two further deductions of points ahead of the 2023–24 League One season. First, on 19 May, the EFL announced Wigan would be deducted four points for failing to pay players' wages. A further four-point deduction was suspended until 30 June 2024, but would be triggered if wages are again paid late before then. The EFL also retrospectively deducted three points from the club's 2022–23 season total; Wigan therefore finished the season on 39 points, 10 points from safety. Owner Al-Jasmi was also required to deposit an amount covering 125% of the club's forecast monthly wage bill by 24 May 2023 or face further sanctions. Second, on 26 May, a further four-point deduction was made after Al-Jasmi missed that deadline despite being given extra time. The club would therefore start its next season with minus eight points.
Club chairman Talal Al-Hammad said an imminent ""eight-figure sum"" would ensure ""financial stability"" until the end of the 2023–24 season, and outlined plans including a 65% reduction in Wigan's wage bill after an ""unsustainable"" Championship relegation campaign. However, the expected payment had not been made by 2 June 2023 and some players were again unpaid, risking further EFL sanctions, and prompting fans groups to urge a sale of the club. Two of Wigan's three directors resigned on 4 June 2023 as fears of a possible winding-up order from HMRC grew, before the owners said they had agreed to sell the club to ""a new buyer"" who had ""committed to resolving all outstanding liabilities at the earliest opportunity"", with any deal ""subject to EFL approval"". However, the potential buyer, Sarbjot Johal, was also involved in negotiations to buy Morecambe and had not provided proof of sufficient funding. On 9 June 2023, Wigan Athletic were placed under a transfer embargo for contravening EFL tax payment rules, and, three days later, HMRC lodged a winding-up petition over unpaid tax, with a hearing date of 26 July. Also on 12 June 2023, it was reported that Wigan-born billionaire and Wigan Warriors RLFC co-owner Mike Danson had renewed his interest in buying Wigan Athletic, with the takeover confirmed on 14 June. On 27 July 2023, defender Jack Whatmough and midfielder Jamie McGrath terminated their contracts with the club following repeated contractual breaches by the previous ownership.


== Stadium ==

Wigan Athletic's stadium is the 25,138 capacity DW Stadium, part of the Robin Park complex in Wigan. It has been the club's home since the 1999–2000 season. Wigan Athletic owns the stadium, but leases the ground to rugby league team Wigan Warriors. The stadium cost £30 million to construct. Previously, home games were played at Springfield Park, the former home of Wigan Borough, which was demolished in June 1999; it is now the site of a housing development. The record attendance at the DW Stadium (then known as the JJB Stadium) for Wigan Athletic is 25,133 for a game against Manchester United on 11 May 2008 – the final match of the 2007–08 season.
The JJB Stadium was the fourth attempt at re-development/re-location for Wigan Athletic, the first coming in 1986 when then-chairman Bill Kenyon revealed plans for a 15,000 all-seater development at Springfield Park including a hotel and shopping facilities. The club was to play at the nearby Woodhouse Stadium (formerly Wigan Municipal Stadium – now demolished) while the building work took place. In 1990, Kenyon submitted his second scheme which would cost £3m, hold 12–15,000 fans and involved moving the pitch nearer to the car park. Neither efforts got past the planning stage. The next chairman, Stephen Gage, spent most of 1993 and 1994 trying to relocate the Latics to the then Robin Park Stadium (now demolished) until his plans were scuppered by Wigan Council when the local council announced plans for their own ground involving Wigan Warriors. Gage finally admitted defeat when he sold the Latics to Dave Whelan on 27 February 1995 for around £1m.
Plans for the JJB Stadium were first published in 1997. Contracts for the new stadium were signed in late 1997 and work began immediately. Originally the ground was to be built for both Wigan Athletic and Orrell R.U.F.C., as grants were only available for multi-use stadia at that time. Wigan Warriors did not figure in the equation until Whelan bought the rugby league club some 12 months later after protracted negotiations with the directors of the rugby league club. The modern all-seater stadium was officially opened on 4 August 1999. Its inauguration was marked with a friendly between Wigan and neighbours Manchester United, who were then reigning European Champions, with Alex Ferguson officially opening the stadium. However, Wigan Athletic hosted Morecambe three days earlier on 1 August as a dress rehearsal for the official opening against Manchester United. The game was played during a violent electrical storm and torrential rain, even so, 4,020 supporters attended and the game ended in a goalless draw. The first competitive football match took place on 7 August 1999, with Wigan Athletic facing Scunthorpe United in a Division 2 match. Simon Haworth scored twice, including the first competitive goal at the new stadium, as Athletic won 3–0.
On 7 March 2005 Greater Manchester Police announced that it would stop policing Wigan Athletic matches at the stadium from 2 April. This move left Wigan Athletic facing the prospect of playing their home games in the Premier League in an empty stadium, so they paid the money they owed to the police. The club appealed against the payments in court and won, with the claims expected to earn the club around £37,000.On 25 March 2009 it was announced that Wigan Athletic would change the name of their stadium to The DW Stadium, after chairman Dave Whelan's commercial venture, DW Sports Fitness. For 2013–14 Europa League fixtures held at the stadium, the ground was known as The Wigan Athletic Stadium.


== Supporters ==

Wigan Athletic Official Supporters Club (formerly known as Wigan Athletic Supporters Travel Club) is the official supporters' association of Wigan Athletic Football Club. The supporters club are a non-profit organisation run by volunteers and meet before home matches in the South Stand Bar.
The Latics' most vocal supporters can be found in the East Stand of the DW Stadium which houses up to 8,206 fans The South Stand of the ground is the family stand.
A long-standing song sung by fans of the club is ""You Are My Sunshine"". In more recent times, ""I'm a Believer"", the Hokey cokey, ""We Built This City"" and ""Gold"" are among some of the songs that have been adapted by Wigan supporters.The club has one unofficial fanzine, The Mudhutter, which is released between 5 and 6 times during the season.
Resulting from a number of incidents at Latics matches where smoke bombs were used by fans (resulting in 17 banning orders as a result of one fixture), several club statements were issued and police presence was increased at some matches. Data from the UK Football Policing Unit found that Wigan Athletic along with Everton and Manchester United had the highest number of incidents involving pyrotechnics.Wigan's return to the Championship saw an average away following of over 1,200. This figure did not include Europa League, Community Shield, League Cup and FA Cup fixtures, where on average supporters turned up in greater numbers.
In 2013, the club sold out their 25,000 allocation for the FA Cup Final and sold 20,000 tickets for the FA Cup semi-final. A total of 5,500 was also sold for the FA Community Shield in the same year.
In 2014, hundreds of fans took part in a charity walk from Wigan to Bolton in aid of local charity Joseph's Goal. Joseph was Wigan's mascot in the 2013 FA Cup Final, led out by captain Emmerson Boyce.
On Boxing Day, over the years many fans have chosen to attend Wigan Athletic's match in fancy dress. This is particularly prominent with away fixtures on that day where the fans are known as the 'Banana Army'. However, on Boxing Day in 2014 a boycott of the club's fixture against Leeds United was ordered by some supporters due to the ticket prices for the match at Elland Road. Around 750 away fans attended the match.During the 2014–15 season, a Fan Advisory Board (FAB) was set up by the club to allow supporters of Wigan Athletic to have a greater say on any issues they may have. The board meets every month to six weeks with the first meeting having taken place in November 2014.


=== Mascot ===
In August 2019, the club announced that a giant pie, called Crusty, would serve as the team's new mascot for the 2019–2020 season. Crusty The Pie was chosen following a competition in which more than 90 primary schools were invited to submit ideas, with over half of the entries opting for a pie.

Since Wigan Athletic's admission to the Football League in 1978, the club has built up several rivalries, mainly with Bolton Wanderers, the club's primary derby match.
One rivalry that has arisen in recent years has been that with Manchester City, since the first time they met in the Second Division in 1998, the season in which City gained passage to the 1999 Division Two play-off final through the “Hand of Goat”. Wigan met City in the 2013 FA Cup Final and beat them 1–0. Since then, City have failed to beat Wigan in the competition; losing 2–1 at the Etihad in the 2013–14 FA Cup Quarter-Final and, in February 2018, losing 1–0 with third tier Wigan beating eventual Premier League champions City with a Will Grigg goal.Wigan also have other local rivalries with Preston North End, Blackburn Rovers, Oldham Athletic, Blackpool and Rochdale.
One of the club's longest and recently forgotten rivalries was with nearby Lancashire based club Chorley, although the two clubs have not played a league game since 1971 when they were in the Northern Premier League. The last time Wigan played Chorley was in the first round of the FA Cup in 2020, with non-league Chorley beating an administration-stricken Wigan 3–2 after extra-time.


== European record ==
Wigan's victory in the 2013 FA Cup Final qualified them for European football for the first and only time, earning them an automatic place in the group stage of the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League.

Ten Green Bottles (book),"Ten Green Bottles is a book by Vivian Jeanette Kaplan and a play based on the book.  It is the true story of a Jewish family that escaped from Nazi-occupied Vienna to Shanghai under Japanese rule.
The book was published in English in Canada and in the U.S. by St. Martin's Press in 2004 and has been republished in Germany (as Von Wien nach Shanghai), Italy (as Dieci Bottiglie Verdi), Hungary (as Sanghaji Fogsag) and China (as 十个绿瓶子). In Canada it won the Canadian Jewish Book Award and in Italy won the ADEI (Associazione Donne Ebree d'Italia) - WIZO Award. It has received generally positive critical reviews in the North American press.
The title of the book comes from the song sung in Marco's Bar by British servicemen stationed in Shanghai.


== Plot ==
The book is told from the viewpoint of the author's mother and starts in 1921. Gerda Karpel (referred to always as Nini in the book) is a 5-year-old Jewish girl living in Vienna in 1921. She comes from an upper-middle-class family. The book starts with the birth of Nini's brother, Willi, and chronicles the death of Nini's father shortly after the birth. The book then discusses day-to-day life from the viewpoint of a Jewish girl growing up in Vienna. It talks about the political instability caused after the assassination of Engelbert Dollfuss and the suppression of democracy after it.
The Anschluss occurs, and Nini desperately tries to secure tickets to Shanghai. She receives help from Herr Berger, a Gentile Vienna lawyer, and obtains tickets for her family and for her friend's parents. The book then mentions the infamous Kristallnacht and the lead up to their departure. In Chapter 19, the Karpel family arrives in Shanghai. They struggle to survive through the poverty and violence that greets them on arrival and to the moving of most Jews into a ghetto in the Hongkou District. During that time, they purchase ownership in a bar owned by Marco, a Bulgarian Jew; this is where Nini heard the song ""Ten Green Bottles"". The book ends with the family leaving Shanghai for Richmond Hill, Canada.


== Play ==
The critically acclaimed world premiere of the play was performed in English in Toronto, Canada in 2009.  All performances were sold out and seen by over 4,000 people. It was produced by Helena Fine of Te-Amim Theatre and written and directed by Mark Cassidy of Threshold Theatre.

The Dead Authors Podcast,"The Dead Authors Podcast is an improvised comedy and faux-historical podcast hosted by Paul F. Tompkins in character as H.G. Wells, with special written material provided by Ben Zelevansky. The show ran from 2011 until 2015. In each episode, Wells collects a deceased author via his ""time machine"" to discuss his or her life and work. The podcast was created in support of 826LA, and all proceeds from the show are donated to the organization.


== History ==
The podcast was recorded live on a monthly basis at the UCB Theater in Los Angeles.When Chapter 39 was released in 2014, Tompkins announced that the podcast would be ending with Chapter 50 the following year. Tompkins commented on the show's ending in an interview with Vulture:

Yes, for a while I was able to feel like I had the energy to do several projects at once. Ultimately, some of these things I did not get paid for, they did not further my career, they were done just for fun. I suddenly remembered my career was supposed to be fun by itself. It would probably be better if I focused on my main sources of income and made those as good as I could possibly make them. It felt as if all of my projects were suffering in that I couldn't give them the time and attention that I wanted. I had to make some tough decisions and really pare it down, which would also leave room to participate in other people's things and not be having to beg off because I've over-committed myself to projects that I have created.

2005 Surinamese general election,"General elections were held in Suriname on 25 May 2005. The governing New Front for Democracy and Development of president Ronald Venetiaan lost seats, remaining the largest party but failing to get a majority in the National Assembly of Suriname. Despite this Venetiaan was re-elected as president after obtaining sufficient support to win a majority in the election for president.


== Background ==
Suriname became independent from the Netherlands in 1975 and in 1980 a coup brought the military to power. By 1982 Desi Bouterse had become head of state and remained in effective control of Suriname until international pressure led to a return to democracy in 1991. The 1991 elections saw the opposition New Front for Democracy and Development win the election and Ronald Venetiaan became president for the first time.In the 1996 elections Venetiaan and the New Front were defeated by National Democratic Party (NDP) led by a former aide to Bouterse, Jules Wijdenbosch. However soaring inflation meant a new election was called one year early in 2000. The New Front won a big victory in the 2000 elections winning 33 of the 51 seats, compared to 7 for the NDP, and 5 for the People's Alliance for Progress of Jules Wijdenbosch who had broken away from the NDP. As a result, Venetiaan became president for a second time.


== Campaign ==
383 candidates spread over ten parties and alliances contested the election, with opinion polls and political analysts in the run up to the election showing that approximately 30% of voters were unsure of whom to vote for. The governing New Front was expected to lose seats in the election despite incumbent Ronald Venetiaan being seen as the most popular candidate for president. The New Front campaigned on their economic record for the previous five years in power.Both the Netherlands, the former colonial ruler of Suriname, and the United States said that relations with Suriname would suffer if the main opposition party, the National Democratic Party, led by Desi Bouterse came back to power. Bouterse had been convicted in the Netherlands for drug smuggling and was accused of involvement in the killing of 15 people in 1982 when he was the military ruler of Suriname. Bouterse, however denied the charges and accused the United States of interfering in the election. Bouterse was popular among many poorer and young voters who had not benefited from the economic changes made by Ronald Venetiaan's government. His campaign slogan was ""Des for Pres"".Two parties of international election monitors from the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) were sent to observe the election. The observers from CARICOM congratulated Suriname on the conduct of the election and described the behaviour of the people of Suriname as an example for the Caribbean. The OAS observers also described the election as having been peaceful and having taken place in a friendly atmosphere.


== Results ==
No party or alliance won a majority of the seats in the election and none came close to getting the two-thirds of seats required to elect a new president. The New Front for Democracy and Development won 23 seats, a drop of 10 from the previous parliament, while the opposition National Democratic Party more than doubled their number of seats to 15. There was surprise at the performance of the new A-Combination alliance which won 5 seats, the same number as the People's Alliance for Progress of former president Jules Wijdenbosch. Two political parties made allegations of fraud in the election but the Independent Election Authority did not find them to be justified.


== Aftermath ==
Following the election the National Assembly had two months to elect a president who would then appoint a government. The New Front party reached an agreement at the beginning of June to bring the A Combination alliance into government giving them a majority in parliament but still short of the two-thirds required to elect a president. The leader of the National Democratic Party, Bouterse, did not stand in the presidential election after reaching an agreement with the People's Alliance for Progress to back Rabin Parmessar.In the first two rounds of the presidential election 27 members of the parliament voted for the New Front candidate, incumbent president Ronald Venetiaan, while 20 voted for Rabin Parmessar. As neither candidate received a two-thirds majority, the election was taken to the People’s Assembly. In the People’s Assembly, which was composed of members of parliament, provincial and district councils, a simple majority was required to be elected president. In the election on 3 August 2005 Venetiaan won 560 votes as against 315 for Parmessar and so was re-elected as president of Suriname.

Magic: The Gathering (1997 video game),"Magic: The Gathering is a video game published by MicroProse in March 1997 based on the collectible card game Magic: The Gathering. It is often referred to as Shandalar after the plane of Shandalar, where the game takes place. The player must travel the land and fight random enemies to gain cards, and defeat five wizards representing the five colors. The player must prevent one color from gaining too much power, and defeat the planeswalker Arzakon, who has a deck of all five colors. Adventure and role-playing elements are present, including inventory, gold, towns, dungeons, random battles, and character progression in the form of new abilities and a higher life point total. An oversized version of Aswan Jaguar was included in the game box.
Two related products were released, the expansion pack Spells of the Ancients and Duels of the Planeswalkers. Duels of the Planeswalkers was an improved version of the main game that did not require the original to be installed.


== Game mechanics ==
The game has several modes: a single-player campaign, and a duel or tournament against computer-controlled opponents. A ManaLink upgrade added a multiplayer feature enabling players to interact via Internet, modem, serial connection, or LAN. All share the same dueling interface, which is based on the mechanics of the real-life Magic: The Gathering card game. In Duel and Multiplayer modes, the game allowed a player to construct his or her own deck (using a specialized Deck Editor), or to play with a randomly generated deck (simulating a ""fresh pack of cards"" as was the custom in various tournaments at the time). The single-player campaign however required the player to participate in a large-scale quest, during which he or she would endeavor to gather cards and thus be able to construct more powerful playing decks, hopefully powerful enough to defeat the campaign's chief antagonists.MicroProse signed a contract with Simutronics to provide online support for the game.


=== Duel mode ===
The card duel mode of the game attempts to simulate the experience of playing with actual Magic: The Gathering cards. The player is shown a tableaux that is divided into two halves - the lower half for the player's cards, and the upper half for the opponent's cards. Both players draw randomly from their own available cards (their personal ""deck""), then proceed to play a standard game of Magic: The Gathering, based as closely as possible on Magic: The Gathering official rules. The match progresses in phases and turns, corresponding with the M:TG rule-set, with the program automatically skipping over certain phases when no action is possible and/or required. The player can set break-points to allow him or her to execute ""fast-acting"" spells or card abilities in case the program is not smart enough to automatically spot such possibilities. Each player's life-counter is displayed on their side of the playing field and will either rise or drop according to the progression of the game. The player can also rearrange his or her played cards to allow better visibility when the playing field becomes crowded, often during prolonged matches. When the card duel is initiated as part of the single-player campaign, special rules may apply. Often this includes a higher (or lower) life counter for one or both players, a card that appears at the start of the match for one or both players, or a global effect that influences both players (either beneficial or detrimental, often depending on the composition of either player's deck).


=== Single-player campaign mode ===
The single-player campaign is played mainly on an isometric representation of the game world, consisting of a randomly generated landscape dotted with terrain features and places of interest. The player initially selects a difficulty level (determines starting gold, cards, amulets and the life totals of ""boss"" enemies) and a preferred magical ""color"", and subsequently is given a predetermined deck, according to difficulty level and color chosen. The character is then transported to the world map, initiating the game. Travel across the world map is in real-time. The player moves the character across the landscape using simple mouse clicks, evading or intercepting enemies who themselves are predominantly interested in intercepting the player-character. Upon a successful interception, the game transitions into ""duel"" mode, wherein either the player competes against the encountered enemy using the Magic: The Gathering card game system, or pays the enemy an amount of gold to not duel. When dueling an enemy, a card or set of cards is often wagered, with particularly powerful enemies sometimes offering additional rewards beyond the waged cards. Some enemies have unique abilities that allow them to gain a specific advantage for the duration of the battle, while some enemies can summon up a surprise substitution to play in their stead (e.g., a more powerful enemy). The landscape is composed of patches of different types of terrain, corresponding with the five colors of the game world. Different terrain might offer benefits or hindrance to movement, including roads through all terrain types which allow rapid movement. Terrain also dictates the boundaries across which enemies may travel, as they have to adhere to terrain matching their own color(s). More importantly, each type of terrain offers a chance for special encounters to appear, often unique to one terrain type or another. Such encounters yield anything from combat to instant rewards, and often include riddles that require some knowledge of the various game cards.The world map contains a large number of cities which can be visited, and these form the backbone for the game's underlying role-playing mechanics. Each city offers some cards for sale of a color matching the terrain around the city; the purchase of food (required to prevent slow-downs on the world map due to hunger); and often quests that usually involve reaching another city, acquiring a specific card, or defeating an enemy in the nearby area. These quests often has a reward at the end wherein the play will receive cards, hints to castle secrets or Mana links. Obtaining Mana links raises the players life points. These Mana link can also be removed if the city in which it was obtained is overrun by a creature.  Cities also buy cards from the player, allowing him or her to make money for the purchase of food, better cards and spend them in certain special areas (for example, to buy amulets from a Gem Bazaar). Some cities also offer special items that enhance player performance or allow the player to create special effects such as instant teleportation. Some of these effects, depend on the consumption of colored amulets that can be collected in various encounters, earned upon completion of quests, or purchased  These gems can also be traded for rarer cards (generally those of the same color of the amulet) at various towns. The landscape also contains a handful of dungeons whose locations can be discerned through various means, particularly the completion of quests and the defeat of powerful enemies. Within a dungeon, life lost in each duel carries over to all others, and other special rules will apply which could hinder or enhance a player's abilities. For example, a particular card could be permanently in effect. The dungeon interface is made up of a randomly generated series of perpendicular tunnels, with enemies placed in various locations and intersections. The player has freedom of movement within the tunnels while enemies remain stationary, but the player cannot pass through a spot taken by an enemy without initiating combat with that enemy. The tunnels also contain bonuses that can be picked up which provide a random effect, often bestowing extra life points or a free creature at the start of the next duel. Dungeons are important because of the special, valuable and powerful cards contained within that can be found no where else, frequently offering one of the Power Nine.The player's primary goal is to destroy the five evil mages who are vying to cast the Spell of Dominion, which will enable them to conquer Shandalar. To accomplish this, the player must seek out and destroy the castle of each and every mage. Castles are played similarly to dungeons, except they contain no special cards but instead house the mage him/herself. If the mage is defeated in a duel, the mage and the castle are permanently destroyed. Until defeated, each mage regularly sends minions to attack cities on the map, which requires the player to react promptly, traveling to this city within the allotted time and defeating the minion in a duel. If the player fails, either by losing to the minion or taking too long to respond, the enemy mage will establish a mana link at the city, leaving the now much more powerful minion to stand guard. If any one mage establishes enough mana links (3 or 5, depending on whether or not the player possesses a certain item) to cast the ""Spell of Dominion"", which will bring the plane of Shandalar under their control, the game is lost.  After defeating all five mages, the player then has to confront a final enemy who plays with cards of all five colors. This enemy has vastly more life points than any other enemy in the game. The amount of damage the player manages to do to this final boss before the fight ends constitutes the player's final score for the campaign.


== Development ==
The project to make Magic: The Gathering came during turbulent and troubled times at MicroProse, as it had recently lost a large amount of money pursuing unprofitable ventures (such as an arcade game business). A corresponding flight of personnel was happening as well. Sensing trouble with the Magic project, the famous and marquee Sid Meier was assigned to it. This game would be the last that Meier would ever work on with MicroProse, as he went on to found his own studio, Firaxis Games, shortly afterward.The game was single-player only upon release. MicroProse later released ManaLink, an upgrade enabling multiplayer, as both a free download and an included feature of the Duels of the Planeswalkers expansion pack.The game had several notable bugs, the most prominent being a miscoding for the card Verduran Enchantress enabling a player to obtain a free draw when casting specific other cards, such as Giant Growth.


== Reception ==
In preparation for the game's launch, Spectrum HoloByte shipped 220,000 units to stores. Magic: The Gathering sold over 400,000 units by early 1999.Next Generation reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that ""The lack of mutliplayer and oddly high system requirements will keep Magic: The Gathering from becoming a gaming classic or even one that fans of the genre will want. In the end, whether you're a fan of the card game or not, there are only two words to describe this release, and they're both 'mediocre.'""GameSpot gave it a generally positive review, stating ""This translation looks beautiful, plays decently, and has all the qualities - except the ability to play with other humans - that made the card game a hit.""Magic: The Gathering holds a 80% rating on GameRankings.Magic: The Gathering was named the 35th best computer game ever by PC Gamer UK in 1997. The editors called it ""very good indeed"". In 2023, Dominic Tarason of PC Gamer included the game on a list of games that had ""a huge impact on PC gaming"". Tarason described the game as ""[...] a revelation. Not only was it an excellent adaptation of the ascendant CCG, but it had a mind-bendingly expansive campaign mode named Shandalar, unprecedented for its time.""

The Legend of Lotus Spring,"The Legend of Lotus Spring is a graphical adventure computer game co-developed by Women Wise and Xing Xing and released on Valentine's Day in 2000 in North America. It was originally released by Xing Xing in 1998 in China.


== Development ==


=== Conception ===
The game was created by Vancouver-based developer Xing Xing. The Toronto-based publisher Women Wise found out about the game by accident; Xing Xing had sent it to many publishers, and they had found it on someone's reject pile. WomenWise founder and producer Anne-Marie Huurre took and played it, and thought it was worth pursuing. Women Wise decided that the game's fringe target market should be ""older girls, young women"". This is because Huurre had a positive response when she tested the finished game on women due to its animation, visuals, and pace.


=== Design ===
She decided to target the game specifically to women due to there being so few female-targeted games on the market. Huurre proposed that Dreamcatcher Interactive distribute it. Other publishers had rejected it due to fears it wouldn't sell due to girls not playing games. Dreamcatcher believed in the concept, but required more work to be done on the game before release, so Women Wise officially became the game's second developer. They worked with historians to recreate the Garden of Perfect Brightness, an 800-acre secret hideaway for the elite outside of Beijing. Huurre added production values that would appeal specifically to the female demographic, for instance commissioning a free PDF novella set in the world of the game, which was written by romance author C. Anne Williams. Williams' research included the culture and history of the Garden of Perfect Brightness, and reading Dragon Lady: The Life and Legend of the Last Empress of China by Sterling Seagrave, and The Devil Soldier: The American Soldier of Fortune Who Became a God in China by Caleb Carr, as well as the history of the British-Sino opium wars. The team hoped to release the novella as an audiobook. They cross-promoted the game with the free PDF off of iReadRomance.com. There was also a contest to win a Rocket eBook from Rocket Reader when players purchased the game or entered on the women-wise web site. They were  also developing CDs and a TV program to add to the project. The Legend of Lotus Spring became the first title released under the Women Wise brand.


== Plot and gameplay ==
The Legend of Lotus Spring is set during the Qing dynasty with a historical Chinese theme. It takes place in Beijing's Yuan Ming Yuan, a real-world location. The plot centres around the love between the ruling emperor Xian Feng and the women he loves - a concubine called HeHanQu who he renamed Lotus Spring who live together in the  Garden of Perfect Brightness, until she disappears. The finished game uses a real-world historical background, and features an emotional story centered on its characters, in the style of Myst.


== Critical reception ==
In reviewing the game, IGN said that, ""in the quest to make a game suitable and enjoyable to a more softcore female demographic, The Legend of Lotus Spring suffers in its intelligence and quality"". Interactfiction noted the game as a prime example of adventure titles where one is stuck in an unwinnable state due to an innocuous action they took early in the game, though also singled it out as an example of an adult version of a ""pink game"" (a video game aimed at females). WomenGamers.com praised the title's ""painstaking virtual recreations"". MrBillsAdventureland appreciated that while the game was not strictly educational, it gave the reviewer a sense of Chinese culture, tradition and art. Allgame praised the title's ""atmosphere and story"". Just Adventure enjoyed the title's ""breathtaking, elegant style and rich storytelling"". AdventureGamers felt the experience was delightful and beautiful. Eblong liked the title's ""rich, engaging setting"". MacHOME hoped Women Wise would refine their skills and produce more games for the female demographic in the future. Applelinks deemed the title ""a noble step into somewhat uncharted territory"" - a game targeted at woman that didn't rely on unhealthy stereotypes like pink, shopping, and fashion.It received some positive reviews, but had disappointing sales.


== Women Wise ==
Women Wise is a new media production company based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, whose corporate culture and goals are centered on encouraging women to become involved with new technology.  It was founded by Anne-Marie Huurre in the late 1990s. The Legend of Lotus Spring has been its only significant product to date.  Women Wise also commissioned a novella set in the world of the game, which was written by ebook author C. Anne Williams.

Mount Skylight,"Mount Skylight is a mountain in the Adirondack High Peaks in the Adirondack Mountains of New York. It gets its name from its open, bare and relatively flat summit, unusual in the Adirondack High Peaks.  Skylight is the fourth highest peak in New York.A remote summit by any approach, it is nonetheless a favorite of hikers. It is famously distinguished by two large cairns that have grown on either end of the summit over the years, as 46er lore has it that carrying a rock up and placing it on them will ensure good weather.
A single trail goes up to the mountain's summit from the Four Corners junction between Skylight and Mount Marcy, its northern neighbor. As the name suggests, there are three ways to get there. Most commonly, hikers come from the west, via the Feldspar Brook Trail from the campsites at the Flowed Lands and climb the peak in conjunction with a visit to Lake Tear of the Clouds (often considered the source of the Hudson River), and a climb up neighboring, trail-less Gray Peak. The trailhead can also be reached by descending from Marcy to the north, or via Panther Gorge and Elk Lake to the southeast, all very lengthy trips that are usually done via an overnight backpack.

Rijksdienst voor het Cultureel Erfgoed,"Rijksdienst voor het Cultureel Erfgoed (RCE, Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands) often abbreviated as Cultureel Erfgoed, is a Dutch heritage organisation working for the protection and conservation of National Heritage Sites. It is located in Amersfoort, province of Utrecht.


== Responsibilities ==
Cultureel Erfgoed is a department of the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science. Their responsibilities include managing the official list of Rijksmonumenten known as the Monumentenregister, (the storage and restoration of) the National art collection of the Netherlands, the National Archaeological Ship storage and fleet, and Archis, the central archaeological information system. They also subsidize grants in the fields of both movable and immovable cultural heritage. The RCE carries out the Dutch law known as the ""Monumentenwet 1988"" (English: Cultural property law), and wherever registered cultural heritage is threatened, the department takes action, whether by advising the proper authorities, by conducting public campaigns and education programs, or through legal action.

Registered city or village views considered to be important to the country's heritage (known as Beschermde stads- of dorpsgezichten) are also protected by the Rijksdienst voor Cultureel Erfgoed.


== History ==
In 1875, the Dutch Ministry of Internal Affairs founded the department Kunsten en Wetenschap (Arts & Sciences), this department awarded grants  for cultural property restoration. In 1903 there was a Rijkscommissie tot het opmaken en uitgeven van een Inventaris en eene Beschrijving van de Nederlandsche monumenten van Geschiedenis en Kunst which in 1918 became the Rijksbureau voor de Monumentenzorg (Bureau for Cultural property Care). In 1947 this organisation was renamed to the Rijksdienst voor de Monumentenzorg. The archeological part of this organisation separated in 1947 into the Rijksdienst voor het Oudheidkundig Bodemonderzoek, which in 1995 merged with the Nederlands Instituut voor Scheeps- en onderwaterarcheologie (NISA). The archeological and cultural property departments merged in 2006 and became the Rijksdienst voor Archeologie, Cultuurlandschap en Monumenten (RACM). In 2009 this organisation was renamed to the Rijksdienst voor het Cultureel Erfgoed (RCE) it moved into a new building in Amersfoort.

Dolomedes schauinslandi,"Dolomedes schauinslandi or the Rangatira spider is a large spider of the family Pisauridae. It is only found on South East Island (Rangatira), Houruakopara and Mangere Islands in the Chatham Islands, New Zealand. It is one of New Zealand's largest and rarest spiders.


== Description ==
This large Dolomedes spider was first described by Eugène Simon in 1899 as ""one of the biggest and most robust species of the genus Dolomedes"". This species demonstrates sexual dimorphism, with male body lengths of 18.6–26.0 millimetres (0.73–1.02 in) and females of 23.3–30.2 millimetres (0.92–1.19 in). Both males and females are substantially larger than other New Zealand Dolomedes species. The carapace and legs are red-brown with orange stripes on the centre and sides of the abdomen. They have bright eye shine and can be spotted at night from 20 metres away.


== Ecology ==
D. schauinslandi is active at night in forest and scrubland habitat, where it hunts for wētā on the forest floor or tree trunks. Its predators may include mice and weka, which would explain its absence from Pitt Island, where it was described as common in the original species description. Mating has not been observed, but females have been observed carrying egg sacs in their chelicerae in November and December and guarding their nursery from December to February, as would be expected for a nursery web spider.


== Conservation ==
This species, the only Dolomedes known from the Chatham Islands, is classified as having a relict population status, due to it surviving in less than 10% of its previously known habitat. It was probably present on the main Chatham Island prior to human settlement, as it is found on mouse-free Houruakopara Island which is only 200 m offshore. The other two islands in its current range, Mangere and Rangatira, are now free of introduced mammals and have restricted access to maintain their predator-free status; Rangatira was farmed up to the 1960s, but cats, mice, and rats were never introduced there.The Rangatira spider was first described from specimens collected on Pitt Island, but despite substantial surveys it has not been seen there since the early 1900s. Mice, which are known spider predators, were accidentally introduced to Pitt some time before 1951, and may have driven D. schauinslandi extinct there. It is possible that this species could re-establish itself on Pitt Island, if there was suitable predator-free habitat (Pitt Island has mice but not rats); spiderlings lift their abdomens when exposed to a breeze in the lab, which is a behaviour associated with aerial travel by ballooning.

Thomas Müntzer,"Thomas Müntzer (c. 1489 – 27 May 1525) was a German preacher and theologian of the early Reformation whose opposition to both Martin Luther and the Roman Catholic Church led to his open defiance of late-feudal authority in central Germany. Müntzer was foremost amongst those reformers who took issue with Luther's compromises with feudal authority. He was a leader of the German peasant and plebeian uprising of 1525 commonly known as the German Peasants' War.
In 1514, Müntzer became a priest in Braunschweig, where he began to question the teachings and practices of the Roman Catholic Church. He then became a follower and acquaintance of Martin Luther, who recommended him for a post in Zwickau. His beliefs became increasingly spiritual and apocalyptic; by his arrival at Allstedt in 1523 he had completely broken with Luther. Amidst the peasant uprisings in 1525, Müntzer organized an armed militia in Mühlhausen. He was captured after the Battle of Frankenhausen, tortured and finally executed.
Few other figures of the German Reformation raised as much controversy as Müntzer, which continues to this day. A complex and unusual character, he is now regarded as a significant personality in the early years of the German Reformation and the history of European revolutionaries. Almost all modern studies stress the necessity of understanding his revolutionary actions as a consequence of his theology: Müntzer believed that the end of the world was imminent and that it was the task of the true believers to aid God in ushering in a new era of history. Within the history of the Reformation, his contribution, especially in liturgy and biblical exegesis, was of substance, but remains undervalued.


== Early life and education ==
Thomas Müntzer was born in late 1489 (or possibly early 1490), in the small town of Stolberg in the Harz Mountains of Germany. The legend that his father had been executed by the feudal authorities is untrue. There is every reason to suppose that Müntzer had a relatively comfortable background and upbringing, as evidenced by his lengthy education. Both his parents were still alive in 1520, his mother dying at around that time.Shortly after 1490, the family moved to the neighbouring and slightly larger town of Quedlinburg, and it was as ""Thomas Munczer de Quedlinburgk"" that he enrolled at the University of Leipzig in 1506. Here he may have studied the arts or even theology: relevant records are missing, and it is uncertain whether Müntzer actually graduated from Leipzig. He later enrolled in late 1512 at the Viadriana University of Frankfurt an der Oder. It is not known what degrees he had obtained by 1514, when he found employment within the church: almost certainly a bachelor's degree in theology and/or the arts; and possibly, but less certainly, a master of the arts. Again, the university records are incomplete or missing. At some time in this rather obscure period of his life, possibly before his studies at Frankfurt, he was employed as an assistant teacher in schools in Halle and Aschersleben, at which time, according to his final confession, he is alleged to have formed a ""league"" against the incumbent Archbishop of Magdeburg – to what end the league was formed is wholly unknown.


== Early employment and the Wittenberg contacts ==
In May 1514, he took up a post as priest in the town of Braunschweig (Brunswick), where he was occupied on and off for the next few years. It was here that he began to question the practices of the Catholic Church, and to criticize, for example, the selling of indulgences. In letters of this time, he is already being addressed by friends as a ""castigator of unrighteousness"". Between 1515 and 1516, he also managed to find a job as schoolmaster at a nunnery in Frose, near Aschersleben.
In the autumn of 1517, he was in Wittenberg, met with Martin Luther, and became involved in the great discussions which preceded the posting of Luther's 95 Theses. He attended lectures at the university there, and was exposed to Luther's ideas as well as other ideas originating with the humanists, among whom was Andreas Bodenstein von Karlstadt, who later became a radical opponent of Luther. Müntzer did not remain in Wittenberg for long, and was reported in various other locations in Thuringia and Franconia. He continued to be paid for his position at Braunschweig until early 1519, when he turned up in the town of Jüterbog, north-east of Wittenberg, where he had been asked to stand in for the preacher Franz Günther. Günther had already been preaching the reformed gospel, but had found himself attacked by the local Franciscans; requesting leave of absence, he left the scene and Müntzer was sent in. The latter picked up where Günther had left off. Before long, the local ecclesiastics were complaining bitterly about Müntzer's heretical ""articles"" which challenged both church teaching and church institutions. By this time, Müntzer was not simply following Luther's teachings; he had already begun to study the works of the mystics Henry Suso and Johannes Tauler, was seriously wondering about the possibility of enlightenment through dreams and visions, had thoroughly explored the early history of the Christian church, and was in correspondence with other radical reformers such as Karlstadt.
In June 1519, Müntzer attended the disputation in Leipzig between the reformers of Wittenberg (Luther, Karlstadt, and Philip Melanchthon) and the Catholic Church hierarchy (represented by Johann Eck). This was one of the high points of the early Reformation. Müntzer did not go unnoticed by Luther, who recommended him to a temporary post in the town of Zwickau. However, at the end of that year, he was still employed in a nunnery at Beuditz, near Weissenfels. He spent the entire winter studying works by the mystics, the humanists, and the church historians.


== Zwickau ==
In May 1520, Müntzer was able to capitalize on the recommendation made by Luther a year earlier, and stood in as temporary replacement for a reformist/humanist preacher named Johann Sylvanus Egranus at St Mary's Church in the busy town of Zwickau (population at that time ca. 7,000), near the border with Bohemia. Zwickau was in the middle of the important iron- and silver-mining area of the Erzgebirge, and was also home to a significant number of plebeians, primarily weavers. Money from the mining operations, and from the commercial boom which mining generated, had infiltrated the town. This led to an increasing division between rich and poor citizens, and a parallel consolidation of larger manufacturers over small-scale craftsmen. Social tensions ran high. It was a town which, although exceptional for the times, nurtured conditions which presaged the trajectory of many towns over the following two centuries.At St Mary's, Müntzer carried on as he had started in Jüterbog. This brought him into conflict with the representatives of the established church. He still regarded himself as a follower of Luther, however, and as such he retained the support of the town council, so much so that when Egranus returned to post in late September 1520, the town council appointed Müntzer to a permanent post at St Katharine's Church.
St Katharine's was the church of the weavers. Even before the arrival of Lutheran doctrines, there was already in Zwickau a reform movement inspired by the Hussite Reformation of the 15th century, especially in its radical, apocalyptic Taborite flavour. Amongst the Zwickau weavers this movement was particularly strong, along with spiritualism. Nikolaus Storch was active here, a self-taught radical who placed every confidence in spiritual revelation through dreams. Soon he and Müntzer were acting in concert. In the following months, Müntzer found himself more and more at odds with Egranus, the local representative of the Wittenberg movement, and increasingly embroiled in riots against the local Catholic priests. The town council became nervous at what was going on at St Katharine's, and in April 1521 at last decided that enough was enough: Müntzer was dismissed from his post and was forced to leave Zwickau.


== Prague and months of wandering ==
Müntzer initially travelled over the border into Bohemia to the town of Žatec (Saaz); this town was known as one of the five ""safe citadels"" of the radical Taborites of Bohemia. But Müntzer only used this as a stop-over en route to Prague. It was in Prague that the Hussite Church was already firmly established and Müntzer thought to find a safe home where he could develop his increasingly un-Lutheran ideas. He arrived here in late June 1521, was welcomed as a ""Martinist"" (a follower of Luther), and was allowed to preach and to give lectures. He also found the time to prepare a summary of his own beliefs, which appeared in a document known to posterity, slightly misleadingly, as the Prague Manifesto. This document exists in four forms: one in Czech, one in Latin, and two in German. One of them is written on a large piece of paper, about 50 by 50 centimetres (20 by 20 in), much like a poster, but written on both sides. However, it is evident that none of the four items was ever published in any shape or form. The contents of this document indicate clearly just how far he had diverged from the road of the Wittenberg reformers, and how much he believed that the reform movement was something apocalyptic in nature. ""I, Thomas Müntzer, beseech the church not to worship a mute God, but a living and speaking one; none of the gods is more contemptible to the nations than this living one to Christians who have no part of him.""In November or December 1521, having discovered that Müntzer was not at all what they had supposed, the Prague authorities ran him out of town. The next twelve months were spent wandering in Saxony: he turned up in Erfurt and in Nordhausen, in each of which he spent several weeks, applying for suitable posts but failing to be appointed. He also visited his hometown in Stolberg to give sermons (Easter), and in November 1522 visited Weimar to attend a disputation. From December 1522 until March 1523, he found employment as chaplain at a nunnery at Glaucha just outside Halle. Here he found little opportunity to continue with his desire for change, despite the existence of a strong and militant local reform movement; his one attempt to break the rules, by delivering the communion ""in both kinds"" (Utraquism) to a noblewoman named Felicitas von Selmenitz probably led directly to his dismissal.


== Allstedt ==
His next post was both relatively permanent and productive. In early April 1523, through the patronage of Selmenitz, he was appointed as preacher at St John's Church in Allstedt in Saxony. He found himself working alongside another reformer, Simon Haferitz who preached at the church of St Wigberti. The town of Allstedt was small, barely more than a large village (population 600), with an imposing castle set on the hill above it. Elector Friedrich held the right to appoint to St John's, but the town council either forgot to advise him, or did not feel that his approval was necessary. Almost immediately on arrival, Müntzer was preaching his version of the reformed doctrines, and delivering the standard church services and masses in German. Such was the popularity of his preaching and the novelty of hearing services in German that people from the surrounding countryside and towns were soon flocking to Allstedt. Some reports suggest that upwards of two thousand people were on the move every Sunday. Within weeks, Luther heard of this and wrote to the Allstedt authorities, asking them to persuade Müntzer to come to Wittenberg for closer inspection. Müntzer refused to go. He was far too busy carrying through his Reformation and wanted no discussion ""behind closed doors"". At this time, he also married Ottilie von Gersen, a former nun; in the spring of 1524, Ottilie gave birth to a son.
It was not only Luther who was concerned. The Catholic Count Ernst von Mansfeld spent the summer of 1523 trying to prevent his own subjects from attending the reformed services in Allstedt. Müntzer felt secure enough to pen a letter to the count in September, ordering him to leave off his tyranny: ""I am as much a Servant of God as you, so tread gently, for the whole world has to be exercised in patience. Don’t grab, or the old coat may tear. (...) I will deal with you a thousand times more drastically than Luther with the Pope.""Throughout the remainder of 1523, and into 1524, Müntzer consolidated his reformed services and spread his message in the small town. He arranged for the printing of his German Church Service; the Protestation or Proposition by Thomas Müntzer from Stolberg in the Harz Mountains, now pastor of Allstedt, about his teachings; and On the Counterfeit Faith, in which he set out his belief that the true faith came from inner spiritual suffering and despair.
In the spring of 1524, supporters of Müntzer burned down a small pilgrimage chapel at Mallerbach, much to the annoyance of the abbess of the Naundorf nunnery. The town council and the castellan failed to do anything about her complaint. But in July, Müntzer was invited before the Electoral Duke Johann in Allstedt Castle, possibly in lieu of a belated ""trial sermon"", and there he preached his famous sermon on the Second Chapter of the Book of Daniel (aka The Sermon Before the Princes) – a barely concealed warning to the princes that they should pitch in with the Allstedt reforms or face the wrath of God.

What a pretty spectacle we have before us now – all the eels and snakes coupling together immorally in one great heap. The priests and all the evil clerics are the snakes...and the secular lords and rulers are the eels... My revered rulers of Saxony...seek without delay the righteousness of God and take up the cause of the gospel boldly.
The immediate reaction of the princes is not documented, but Luther did not hold back: he published his Letter to the Princes of Saxony about the Rebellious Spirit demanding the radical's banishment from Saxony. However, the princes simply summoned all the relevant persons of Allstedt, Müntzer included, to a hearing at Weimar where, after being interrogated separately, they were warned about their future conduct. This hearing had the desired effect upon town officials, who back-pedalled rapidly and withdrew their support for the radicals. In the night of 7 August 1524, Müntzer slipped out of Allstedt (by necessity abandoning wife and son, who were only later able to join him), and headed for the self-ruling Imperial Free City of Mühlhausen, around 65 kilometres (40 mi) to the southwest.


== Mühlhausen and Nuremberg ==
 Mühlhausen was a city with a population of 8,500. During 1523 social tensions which had been brewing for several years came to a head, and the poorer inhabitants had managed to wrest some political concessions from the town council; building on this success, the radical reform movement kept up the pressure, under the leadership of a lay preacher named Heinrich Pfeiffer, who had been denouncing the practices of the old church from the pulpit of St Nikolaus Church. Thus, before Müntzer arrived, there was already considerable tension in the air. He was not appointed to any pulpit, but this did not stop him from preaching, agitating, and publishing pamphlets against Luther. His comrade-in-arms here was Pfeiffer; while the two men did not necessarily share the same beliefs (as in Zwickau with Storch) there was enough common-ground in their reformatory zeal and belief in the inspired spirit to allow them to work together closely. A minor civic coup took place in late September 1524, as a result of which, leading members of the town council fled the town, taking with them the city insignia and the municipal horse. But the coup was short-lived – partly because of divisions within the reformers inside the town and partly because the peasantry in the surrounding countryside took issue with the ""unchristian behaviour"" of the urban radicals. After only seven weeks in the town, on 27 September, Müntzer was forced to abandon wife and child once more and escape with Pfeiffer to a safer haven.He travelled first to Nuremberg in the south, where he arranged for the publication of his anti-Lutheran pamphlet A Highly Provoked Vindication and Refutation of the unspiritual soft-living flesh in Wittenberg, as well as one entitled A Manifest Exposé of False Faith. Both were confiscated by the city authorities, the former before any copies could be distributed. Müntzer kept a low profile in Nuremberg, clearly considering that his best strategy would be to spread his teaching in print, rather than end up behind bars. He remained there until November and then left for the southwest of Germany and Switzerland, where peasants and plebeians were beginning to organize themselves for the great peasant uprising of 1525 in defiance of their feudal overlords. There is no direct evidence of what Müntzer did in this part of the world, but almost certainly he would have come in contact with leading members of the various rebel conspiracies; it is proposed that he met the later Anabaptist leader, Balthasar Hubmaier in Waldshut, and it is known that he was in Basel in December, where he met the Zwinglian reformer Oecolampadius, and may also have met the Swiss Anabaptist Conrad Grebel there. He spent several weeks in the Klettgau area, and there is some evidence to suggest that he helped the peasants to formulate their grievances. While the famous ""Twelve Articles"" of the Swabian peasants were certainly not composed by Müntzer, at least one important supporting document, the Constitutional Draft, may well have originated with him.


== Final months ==
In February 1525 Müntzer returned to Mühlhausen (via Fulda, where he was briefly arrested and then – unrecognized – released) and took over the pulpit at St Mary's Church; the town council neither gave, nor was asked for, permission to make this appointment; it would seem that a popular vote thrust Müntzer into the pulpit. Immediately, he and Pfeiffer, who had managed to return to the town some three months earlier, were at the centre of considerable activity. In early March, the citizens were called upon to elect an ""Eternal Council"" which was to replace the existing town council, but whose duties went far beyond the merely municipal. Surprisingly, neither Pfeiffer nor Müntzer were admitted to the new council, nor to its meetings. Possibly because of this, Müntzer then founded the ""Eternal League of God"" in late March (but some researchers date this League to September 1524). This was an armed militia, designed not just as a defence league, but also as a God-fearing cadre for the coming apocalypse. It met under a huge white banner which had been painted with a rainbow and decorated with the words The Word of God will endure forever. In the surrounding countryside and neighbouring small towns, the events in Mühlhausen found a ready echo, for the peasantry and the urban poor had had news of the great uprising in southwest Germany, and many were ready to join in.

In late April, all of Thuringia was up in arms, with peasant and plebeian troops from various districts mobilized. However, the princes were laying their own plans for the suppression of the revolt. The feudal authorities had far better weapons and more disciplined armies than their subjects. At the beginning of May, the Mühlhausen troop marched around the countryside in north Thuringia, but failed to meet up with other troops, being content to loot and pillage locally.

Luther pitched in very firmly on the side of the princes; he made a tour of southern Saxony – Stolberg, Nordhausen, and the Mansfeld district – in an attempt to dissuade the rebels from action, although in some of these places he was roundly heckled. He followed this up with his pamphlet Against the Robbing and Murdering Hordes of Peasants, calling for the ruthless suppression of the revolt. This had a title and a timing that could not have been more ill-considered since it was the German peasantry who at that time died in their thousands at the hands of the princely armies. Estimates put the figure at 70,000–75,000, possibly even as high as 100,000.At length, on 11 May, Müntzer and what remained of his troops arrived outside the town of Frankenhausen, meeting up with rebels there who had been asking for help for some time. No sooner had they set up camp on a hill than the princes’ army arrived, having already crushed the rebellion in southern Thuringia. On 15 May, battle was joined. It lasted only a few minutes, and left the streams of the hill running with blood. Six thousand rebels were killed, but only a few soldiers. Many more rebels were executed in the following days. Müntzer fled, but was captured as he hid in a house in Frankenhausen. His identity was revealed by a sack of papers and letters which he was clutching. On 27 May, after torture and confession, he was executed alongside Pfeiffer, outside the walls of Mühlhausen, their heads being displayed prominently for years to come as a warning to others.


== Theology ==
Müntzer's theology has been the subject of many studies over the years. Modern researchers agree that Müntzer was deeply read and that it was his theology, and not any socio-political dogma, which drove him to stand up to feudal authority. The short paragraphs below attempt to give a very brief summary of his theology.


=== Influences and study ===
Evident from Müntzer's writings is his broad knowledge of aspects of the Christian religion. From 1514 onwards, possibly earlier, he read widely in the early Christian fathers (Tertullian and Cyprian), in the history of the early church (Eusebius and Egesippus), in the mystics of the late medieval period (Suso and Tauler), in Humanist ideas which harked back to Plato, and in the Bible itself. By around 1522, after he had left Prague, most of his theology had matured and settled around some guiding principles, even if some details, such as the identity of ""the Elect"", were unclear.


=== The spirit, not the letter ===
Despite the profusion of biblical quotations in Müntzer's writings, it was his doctrine that true belief was dictated by spiritual experience, not by written testimony. The Bible was for him evidence only of spiritual experiences of the past; the words of the Bible still had to be validated by the working of the Spirit in the believer's heart. ""If someone had never had sight or sound of the Bible at any time in his life, he could still hold the one true Christian faith because of the true teaching of the spirit, just like all those who composed the holy Scripture without any books at all."" The insistence on written, Biblical proof by the ""academics"" or scholars (this included Luther) meant that it was impossible for the common man to gain a true understanding of the true faith. Müntzer's true believers (also known as ""the Elect"") were capable of reaching faith through personal suffering, guided by ""true servants of God"", and without regard to Catholic or Lutheran-reformed priests.


=== Dreams and revelations ===
Spiritual revelation came sometimes through dreams and visions and sometimes through suffering. In Zwickau, Müntzer's belief in the possibilities of revelation by dream matched the same belief in the sect of radicals led by Nikolaus Storch. Storch was later to confound Luther's colleague Melanchthon with plausible arguments about this. Müntzer himself clearly believed in the power of vision and dream, as evidenced by his lengthy and carefully argued Sermon Before the Princes, which discussed the dream of Nebuchadnezzar:

So to expect visions and to receive them while in tribulation and suffering, is in the true spirit of the apostles, the patriarchs, and the prophets. Hence it is no wonder that Brother Fatted Pig and Brother Soft Life (i.e. Luther) reject them. But when one has not yet heard the clear word of God in the soul, one has to have visions.


=== Suffering and pain ===
It was essential, in Müntzer's view, for a person to experience real suffering and pain – either spiritual or physical – in order to come to a true Christian belief. The theme of hardship and suffering, purgation and sevenfold cleansing, runs through all of his writings.

What you must do is endure patiently, and learn how God himself will root out your weeds, thistles and thorns from the rich soil which is your heart. Otherwise nothing good will grow there, only the raging devil... Even if you have already devoured all the books of the Bible, you must still suffer the sharp edge of the plough-share
On the very eve of Battle at Frankenhausen, he had this to say to the people of Allstedt:

May the pure fear of God be with you, dear brothers. You must remain unperturbed. If you fail to do so, then your sacrifice is in vain, your heart-sad, heart-felt suffering. You would then have to start suffering all over again... If you are unwilling to suffer for the sake of God, then you will to be martyrs for the devil


=== Fear of God and man ===
One of the principal dialectics in Müntzer's teaching is the opposition of the ""Fear of Man"" to the ""Fear of God"". Regardless of one's position in society, it was necessary for the true believer to have a fear of God and to have no fear of man. This was the thrust of his Sermon Before the Princes and it was the rallying call in his final letter to Mühlhausen in May 1525: ""May the pure, upright fear of God be with you my dear brothers."" In his Sermon Before the Princes he stated quite clearly: ""The fear of God must be pure, unsullied by any fear of men or creaturely things. How desperately we need a fear like this! For just as it is impossible to fear two masters and be saved, so it is impossible to fear both God and created things and be saved.""


=== Apocalypticism ===
Interwoven with Müntzer's mystical piety, as for many of his contemporaries, was a conviction that the whole cosmos stood at a tipping point. Now God would set right all the wrongs of the world, largely by destruction, but with the active assistance of true Christians. From this would emerge a new age of mankind. In the Prague Manifesto he wrote: ""O ho, how ripe the rotten apples are! O ho, how rotten the elect have become! The time of the harvest has come! That is why he himself has hired me for his harvest."" In a letter to the people of Erfurt, in May 1525, he wrote:

Help us in any way you can, with men and with cannon, so that we can carry out the commands of God himself in Ezekiel 34, where he says: ""I will rescue you from those who lord it over you in a tyrannous way"" [and] In Chapter 39 [...] ""Come, you birds of heaven and devour the flesh of the princes; and you wild beasts drink up the blood of all the bigwigs"". Daniel says the same thing in chapter 7: that power should be given to the common man"".


=== ""Omnia sunt communia"" ===

In his final confession under torture of May 1525, Müntzer stated that one of the primary aims of himself and his comrades was ""omnia sunt communia"" – ""all things are to be held in common and distribution should be to each according to his need"". This statement has often been cited as evidence of Müntzer's ""early communism"", but it stands quite alone in all of his writings and letters. It may have been a statement of what his captors feared rather than what Müntzer actually believed. In the same confession, Müntzer is reported as recommending that princes should ride out with a maximum of eight horses and ""gentlemen with two"". Müntzer's own writings and letters clearly propose that power be taken from the feudal authorities and given to the people. For that proposal, he may be described as a revolutionary, but not proposing redistribution of wealth. Subsequent scholars have analysed Müntzer's movement as a communist movement. Friedrich Engels' analysis of Thomas Müntzer's work and the wider German Peasants' War led him and Karl Marx to conclude that the communist revolution, when it occurred, would be led not by a peasant army but by an urban proletariat.


=== Summary ===
The doctrines of essential suffering, of spiritual revelation, of denial of the fear of Man - all combined with the expectation of the Apocalypse to place the ""Elect"" person in total opposition to feudal authority, and to both Catholic and Lutheran teaching. However, this was no individualistic path to salvation. The importance which Müntzer laid on communal activities – the reformed liturgies and the leagues he founded or supported in Zwickau, Allstedt, and Mühlhausen – are central to his ministry. To judge from his writings of 1523 and 1524, it was by no means inevitable that Müntzer would take the road of social revolution. However, it was precisely on this same theological foundation that Müntzer's ideas briefly coincided with the aspirations of the peasants and plebeians of 1525. Viewing the uprising as an apocalyptic act of God, he stepped up as ""God's Servant against the Godless"" and took his position as leader of the rebels.


=== Differences with Luther ===
Müntzer was one of many preachers and theologians caught up in the extraordinary atmosphere of the early Reformation. In this period, from around 1517 to 1525, Martin Luther had no monopoly of the reforms. This was the time not only of Luther, but also of Erasmus of Rotterdam and fellow-Humanists, of the alchemists Paracelsus and Cornelius Agrippa, of localized urban and rural acts of defiance. The social upheavals triggered the Reformation - or more precisely, 'the reformations', for it was above all a time of massive dissent, and indeed dissent from dissent; in turn, the reformation of thought triggered further social and political upheavals.In this roiling pot of ideas, Müntzer quite readily respected Luther for a period and then just as readily rejected the Lutheran doctrines. Although it is clear in retrospect that Müntzer's ideas were already diverging from Luther's at least as early as the period in Zwickau, Müntzer himself may not have been aware of this. Luther, like Müntzer, had shown an avid interest in the mystic and theologian Johannes Tauler. Müntzer may even have looked at Luther's many admiring references to Tauler in his Theologia Germanica and assumed him to be a fellow fan of Tauler's work. In July 1520, Müntzer was still able to sign off a letter to Luther as ""Thomas Müntzer, whom you brought to birth by the gospel"". However, it is clear that Luther considered that Müntzer was moving ahead too fast, and correspondence (now missing) from Wittenberg seems to have contained explicit criticisms of his activities. By March 1522, Müntzer was writing to Melanchthon in Wittenberg, warning that ""our most beloved Martin acts ignorantly because he does not want to offend the little ones... Dear brothers, leave your dallying, the time has come! Do not delay, summer is at the door. ... Do not flatter your princes, otherwise you will live to see your undoing."" An attempt at reconciliation with Luther, in a letter written by Müntzer from Allstedt in July 1523, went without reply. In June 1524, however, Luther published his pamphlet A Letter to the Princes of Saxony concerning the Rebellious Spirit, which essentially called on Prince Friedrich and Duke Johann to deal firmly with the ""rebellious spirit of Allstedt"", this ""bloodthirsty Satan"". Shortly afterwards, Müntzer described Luther as ""Brother Fatted Pig and Brother Soft Life"" in his Sermon Before the Princes. After the summer of 1524, the tone of the written conflict became ever more bitter on both sides, culminating in Müntzer's pamphlet A Highly-Provoked Vindication and a Refutation of the Unspiritual Soft-living Flesh in Wittenberg of 1524, and in Luther's A Terrible History and Judgement of God on Thomas Müntzer of 1525, in which the radical preacher (by then dead) was described as ""a murderous and bloodthirsty prophet"".

== Legacy ==
During the last two years of his life, Müntzer had come into contact with a number of other radicals; prominent amongst them were Hans Hut, Hans Denck, Melchior Rinck, Hans Römer, and Balthasar Hubmaier. All of them were leaders of the emerging Anabaptist movement, which nurtured similar reformed doctrines to those of Müntzer himself. While it is not appropriate to claim that they were all or consistently ""Müntzerites"", it is possible to argue that they all shared some common teaching. A common thread links Müntzer, the early Anabaptists, the ""Kingdom of Münster"" in North Germany in 1535, the Dutch Anabaptists, the radicals of the English Revolution, and beyond.
There was a short-lived legacy even within the ""official"" reformed church as well; in the towns where Müntzer had been active, his reformed liturgies were still being used some ten years after his death.Friedrich Engels and Karl Kautsky claimed him as a precursor of the revolutionaries of more modern times. They based their analysis on the pioneering work of the German liberal historian Wilhelm Zimmermann, whose important three-volume history of the Peasants War appeared in 1843. It is not only as an early ""social revolutionary"" that Müntzer has historical importance as his activities within the early Reformation movement were influential on Luther and his reforms.
Further interest in Müntzer was spurred at various moments in German (occasionally European) history: during the creation of a German national identity between 1870 and 1914; in the revolutionary era in Germany immediately after 1918; in an East Germany looking for its ""own"" history after 1945 (Müntzer's image was used on the 5 East German Mark banknote); and leading up to the 450th anniversary of the Peasant War in 1975 and the 500th anniversary of Müntzer's birth in 1989. In terms of pure statistics, the number of books, articles and essays devoted to Müntzer rose dramatically after 1945. Before that year, around 520 had appeared; between 1945 and 1975, another 500; between 1975 and 2012, 1800.Since around 1918, the number of fictional works on Müntzer has grown significantly; this encompasses over 200 novels, poems, plays and films, almost all in German. A film of his life was produced in East Germany in 1956, directed by Martin Heilberg and starring Wolfgang Stumpf. In 1989, shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Peasants' War Panorama at Bad Frankenhausen was opened, containing the largest oil painting in the world, with Müntzer in central position. The painter was Werner Tübke.


== Müntzer's wife ==
Very little is known about Müntzer's wife Ottilie von Gersen other than the fact that she was a nun who had left a nunnery under the influence of the Reformation movement. Her family name may have been ""von Görschen"". She may have been one of a group of sixteen nuns who left the convent at Wiederstedt, some miles north of Allstedt, of whom eleven found refuge in Allstedt. She and Müntzer were married in June 1523. Apart from the son born to her and Müntzer on Easter Day, 1524, it is possible she was again pregnant at the time of her husband's death, by which time, the son may also have died. A letter she wrote to Duke Georg on 19 August 1525, pleading for the chance to recover her belongings from Mühlhausen, went unheeded. No further reports of her life have been found.

Karl Kautsky on Muntzer",Thomas Müntzer (c. 1489 – 27 May 1525) was a German preacher and theologian of the early Reformation whose opposition to both Martin Luther and the Roman Catholic Church led to his open defiance of late-feudal authority in central Germany. Müntzer was foremost amongst those reformers who took issue with Luther's compromises with feudal authority.,Müntzer opposed Luther's compromises with feudal authority.,1
"Santa Clara, California","Santa Clara (; Spanish for ""Saint Clare"") is a city in the county of the same name. The city's population was 127,647 at the 2020 census, making it the eighth-most populous city in the Bay Area. Located in the southern Bay Area, the city was founded by the Spanish in 1777 with the establishment of Mission Santa Clara de Asís under the leadership of Junípero Serra.
Santa Clara is located in the center of Silicon Valley and is home to the headquarters of companies such as Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, and Nvidia. It is also home to Santa Clara University, the oldest university in California, and Levi's Stadium, the home of the National Football League's San Francisco 49ers, and Cedar Fair's California's Great America Park.  Santa Clara is bordered by San Jose on all sides, except for Sunnyvale and Cupertino to the west.


== History ==
Prior to the arrival of Europeans in the 18th century, the Tamien tribe of the Ohlone nation of Indigenous Californians had inhabited the area for several millennia.


=== Spanish period ===
The first European to visit the valley was José Francisco Ortega in 1769. The Spanish began to colonize California with 21 missions, and the Mission Santa Clara de Asís was founded in 1777.


=== Mexican period ===
The Battle of Santa Clara, one of the last battles of the Conquest of California, was fought between a contingent of Californios, led by Francisco Sánchez, against the invading American forces.


=== American period ===
In 1851, Santa Clara College was established on the grounds of the original Mission. In 1852, Santa Clara was incorporated as a town; it became state-chartered by 1862.
For the next century, the economy centered on agriculture since orchards and vegetables were thriving in the fertile soil. By the beginning of the 20th century, the population had reached 5,000 and stayed about the same for many years.
In 1905, the first public high-altitude flights by humans were made over Santa Clara in gliders designed by John J. Montgomery. The semiconductor industry, which sprouted around 1960, changed the city and surrounding Valley of Heart's Delight; little of its agricultural past remains.
Santa Clara's first medical hospital was built in 1963. This structure, on Kiely Boulevard, was replaced in 2007 with a new Kaiser Permanente medical center located on Lawrence Expressway at Homestead Road.
Santa Clara was also home to a major mental health facility, Agnews State Hospital. According to the National Park Service, more than 100 persons were killed at this site in the 1906 earthquake. The site is the former home to Sun Microsystems and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.
In 1963, Santa Clara City Council voted to knock down the eight-block grid of Downtown Santa Clara, in order to receive federal funding for urban renewal. Since 2017, there has been a grassroots movement to rebuild Santa Clara's historic downtown.


== Geography ==
Santa Clara is drained by three seasonal creeks, all of which empty into the southern portion of San Francisco Bay; these creeks are San Tomas Aquino Creek, Saratoga Creek, and Calabazas Creek.
There are some significant biological resources within the city including habitat for the burrowing owl, a species of special concern in California due to reduction in habitat from urban development during the latter 20th century. This owl uses burrows created by ground squirrels and prefers generally level grasslands and even disturbed areas. Coyotes have also become active in the area in recent years.According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city covers an area of 18.4 square miles (48 km2), all of it land.


=== Climate ===
The average daily temperatures in July range from 82 °F (28 °C) to 53 °F (12 °C). Winters are mild, with the mean daily temperatures in January ranging from 58 °F (14 °C) to 38 °F (3 °C). Most of the annual rainfall comes in the winter months; the summer months are generally rainless.

James Bowen (railroad executive),"James Bowen (February 25, 1808 – September 29, 1886) was the president of Erie Railroad who served as a Union Army general during the American Civil War.


== Biography ==
James Bowen was born at New York City February 25, 1808. His father was a merchant of ample means, and the son was liberally educated. He was not trained to any profession or business calling, but he cultivated habits of business voluntarily and intuitively. He was a close and persistent student of public affairs, and among his intimate associates were Daniel Webster, Gen. James Watson Webb, William H. Seward, Philip Hone, Moses H. Grinnell, Charles A. Peabody (subsequently of national fame as a jurist, who is the only survivor of that notable coterie), and men of similar cast and bent of mind. Most of them were members of a society famous in its day as the Hone Club. Its membership was not only exclusive but limited. Healey's celebrated painting of Webster belonged to this club, and a resolution was passed by the club that the painting should pass to the heirs of the last surviving member. James Bowen was that one, and the painting is now in the possession of Gen. Alexander S. Webb, of New York, to whom it was willed by him.Early in life Mr. Bowen developed a taste for rural life, and he purchased an estate in Westchester County, which was ever after his home. Railroad affairs attracted his attention while the New York and Erie Railroad was in its earliest struggles, and it was at the request of James Watson Webb that he took a leading part in the direction of that company. He was elected a director in 1839; vice-president and treasurer, April 30, 1840, and president pro tern, May 27, 1841, and president in October, 1841.Upon the passage of the act creating the Metropolitan Police of New York City in 1857, James Bowen was appointed by Governor King one of the first Board of Police Commissioners under that act, his associates in the Board being Simeon Draper, James W. Nye (afterward United States Senator), James S. T. Stranahan, and Jacob Chandler. Mr. Bowen was elected president of the Board, and had charge during the exciting and riotous days of Mayor Fernando Wood's organized but unsuccessful opposition to the replacing of his police force by the new one.During the Civil War Mr. Bowen organized six regiments of volunteers. He ceased to be president of the Police' Board at the close of 1862. He was appointed general of the brigade composed chiefly of the six regiments he had enlisted. He went to New Orleans with his command, where he served one year, when he was appointed provost marshal of that department, which embraced Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Alabama, as far as the United States Government had regained control over these States. Just before the war ended General Bowen was compelled by broken health to resign from the army. He returned home, and was soon appointed a Commissioner of Charity and Correction of New York City. While he was in office the Legislature increased the salary of these commissioners from §5,000 to $10,000 a year. General Bowen declared at a meeting of the Board that the increase was an outrage, and he resolutely refused to receive more than the former salary. The attitude he took in the matter resulted in the repeal of the law that authorized the increase. General Bowen served two terms as charity commissioner, and introduced the ambulance system in the hospital service. He greatly improved the standing and efficacy of Bellevue Hospital, by insisting that the best medical skill should be employed there, with the result that to-day a course in the Bellevue Hospital practical schooling in medicine and surgesis considered recommendation sufficient as to the capacity of any beginner in the professional practice of medical science.


=== Family ===
In 1842 James Bowen married Eliza Livingston. She died in 1872. In 1874 he married Josephine Oothout, daughter of John Oothout, then president of the Bank of New York. He survived her, and married Athenia Livingston, a cousin of his first wife. There were no children by either marriage.General Bowen died September 29, 1886, at Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, where he owned a fine estate, his home being preeminently one of culture and refinement. He was a man of entirely domestic habits, of quiet temperament and fine literary taste. His widow married Judge Peabody, his old-time warm friend and associate.


== Work ==


=== Start of Erie Railroad presidency ===
James Bowen who was then Vice-President and Treasurer, was elected to succeed Eleazar Lord as President of the company, and he had the honor and glory of presiding on the historic occasion when the first portion of the New York and Erie Railroad was opened for traffic, although it was through no direct effort of his that the work had progressed thus far. Others who had been striving and hoping for years for even this consummation of the long-laid plans had no active part in the event. Upon many such not even the courtesy of being an invited guest was bestowed.Mr. Bowen was a native of New York City, a man of wealth, a member of the Union Club, and of the Kent Club, famous in that day, in which James Watson Webb, Moses H. Grinnell, Richard M. Blatchford, and similar spirits, were conspicuous. President Bowen was a leader in that coterie, and was especially an intimate of General Webb. The latter had supported the New York and Erie project in his paper, New York Courier and Enquirer, from the beginning, and it was as a friend of his that James Bowen entered the Directory of the company, and through his influence that Bowen was advanced to the Presidency.So far as the public knew, the affairs of Erie were easy. Work was actively progressing all along the line. On the Eastern Division it had reached a stage so near completion, that it was only a matter of a few weeks when the track would be laid the entire distance between Piermont and Goshen and the railroad put in operation. In fact, a month after Bowen became president, a train was run between Piermont and Ramapo, a distance of twenty miles. Already the fact that, even with the railroad in operation on the Eastern Division, its Eastern terminus would still be nearly twenty-five miles from New York City, which distance was to be overcome by steamboat between the city and Piermont, began to excite much discussion, and the advantage that would accrue to the Company if it might have the terminus at or near New York became apparent to observant people, who gave the matter thought.
""A railroad that begins twenty-five miles away from the place it was chartered to bring into communication with some other place,""the Hon. Francis Granger remarked in opposing an effort of the company to obtain public aid,

does not seem to be warranted in supposing that it is entitled to a confidence in its purposes that it would have if it could show that it would deposit its traffic where it protested it intended to deposit it.
The charter of the Company gave it the privilege of constructing its railroad from New York, or from a point near New York. The uniting of the seaboard with the lakes by a railroad which would attract traffic of the great West to New York was the one idea the projectors of this railroad dwelt upon in seeking the charter. So the fact that the road was to come no nearer the great center of the country's trade than twenty-five miles grew to be a question of much comment.


=== Golden opportunity thrown away ===
April 25, 1831, almost a year to a day before the corporation that became the New York and Erie Railroad Company was chartered, the New York and Harlem Railroad Company was granted letters of incorporation, with authority to construct a single or double track railway:

""...from any point on the north bounds of Twenty-third Street to any point on the Harlem River, between the east bounds of the Third Avenue and the west bounds of Eighth Avenue, with a branch to Hudson River, between 124th Street and the north bounds of 129th Street.""April 6, 1832, the charter was amended to authorize the company, with permission of the authorities of New York City, to extend its railroad ""along the Fourth Avenue to Fourteenth Street."" May 12, 1836, the company was authorized to unite with any railroad or canal company organized under the laws of New York State, for the purpose of constructing a railroad, at any point which the directors of the two companies might agree upon. Subsequent legislation empowered the company to extend its railroad to the City Hall. May 7, 1840, the company was authorized to extend its railroad from the Harlem River through the County of Westchester to a point of intersection with the proposed New York and Albany Railroad. The company was also authorized to build a drawbridge across the Harlem River.
At the session of the New York Legislature for 1841, the New York and Harlem Railroad Company was a petitioner for the aid of the State to the amount of $350,000, by the issue of State stock at six per cent, interest, payable in five years, to enable the company to continue its work; the railroad being then in operation from the City Hall in New York to Fordham, a distance of thirteen miles. To influence feeling in its favor the company laid particular stress on the fact that by this concession a communication by rail between New York and Albany would be greatly hastened. This petition was presented to the Legislature, January 26, and was referred to the Senate Committee on Railroads. The application was refused.At this time work on the Erie was at the height of its activity. Eleazar Lord was President of the company. The President of the New York and Harlem Railroad was Samuel R. Brooks. He seems to have been a far-seeing man and a practical one. The New York and Albans - Railroad scheme was languishing, as were most of the railroad enterprises then, and President Brooks, failing to obtain aid from the State for his company, and seeing no immediate future for the New York and Albany Railroad that would benefit him, turned his attention to the Erie, a brief study of the scope of which project convinced him that not only its future greatness, but the salvation and enhancement of his own railroad, lay in a union of the two (as shown in the map).There is no record to show how his idea was received by the Erie management. Eleazar Lord, in his scathing review of the Erie, published in 1855, makes no reference to the Erie-Harlem incident. The Offer was apparently not accepted, and with that a golden opportunity was thrown Away. This might have been the fatal mistake, that made possible all of Erie's subsequent woes - But for that mistake there would be no Vanderbilt Kingdom, and the History of Wall Street and of Railroads in this Country would have been entirely different. All of the Present Great Terminal possessions of the Vanderbilt System at Forty-second Street in New York City might have been Ernie's by a Nod of the Head and the Outlay of Less than $90,000.


=== Overall Erie Railroad operations ===
Bowen was appointed president at the close of May, 1841, and continued in that office till the annual election in October, 1842. During the first six months of that period, the affairs of the Company continued to be prosperous in all four divisions. The Eastern division, after a considerable delay for the arrival of iron, was opened to the public from Piermont to Goshen, in the month of September. The work under the contracts on the Susquehanna and Western divisions was rapidly advanced. That on the Delaware division was delayed by an injunction obtained by the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company.
Under the concurrent influence, however, of the political faction who were opposed to State Loans and to all public works, and of a depressed state of commercial affairs, the sale of the State stock became increasingly difficult, and the price receded from ninety-two per cent, in June, to eighty-two, in December. To avoid so heavy a discount, and prevent a further decline by throwing it on the market, a large amount of it was hypothecated as security for temporary loans. At length, in the course of the winter, the price fell below the rates at which hypothecations had been made, and sales became necessary.The result was a sacrifice of so large a sum (about $300,000) as suddenly to render the Company unable to pay the quarterly interest due on 1 April 1842. Their credit being thus destroyed, and their operations arrested, and there being a variety of claims which were liable to be prosecuted, the Company immediately placed its affairs in the hands of assignees, by whom its interests; were protected, and the Eastern division was kept in successful operation. An effort was made in the Legislature, at the session of 1842, to obtain a release of the State loan and authority to the company to issue bonds; but neither that nor any accommodation in respect to the accruing interest, was agreeable to the politicians at that time.The liabilities of the company, to the extent of about $600,000, for work and materials West of Goshen, and chiefly on the Susquehanna and Western divisions, were unprovided for; and all operations were suspended, and continued so till 1845. Owing to the disappointment of the Central and Western counties, and the old leaven of outside political influence, a change of directors was desired, by which a large majority of the Board should be taken, not from the city as before, but from the interior counties. This was accordingly effected at the annual election in the autumn, 1843. The former directors, with one or two exceptions, declined a reelection. A new direction was chosen, and Mr. William Maxwell, of Chemung county, was appointed president.

Fort Frederik,"Fort Frederik, also known as Frederiksfort, is a U.S. National Historic Landmark in Frederiksted, United States Virgin Islands.  It was built between 1752 and 1760 by Denmark-Norway to defend the economic interests of the natural deep water port of Frederiksted and to ward off pirates.  It has red and white painted walls, making it quite different then yellow and white of Fort Christiansværn on the other side of the island.  It is located at the north end of Frederiksted, in St. Croix, south of the junction of Mahogany Road and VI 631.  It should not be confused with Frederiks Fort, Fortberg Hill, on St. John, which is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
According to Westergaard, ""It was soon found that a customs house was not sufficient, but that cannon must be provided, and placed as to command the roads where the ships lay anchored.  In lack of such a 'water battery', ships were accustomed to slip away in the night-time without securing papers of paying their dues.""In 1776, the first salute from foreign soil to the new nation of the United States of America was fired from the fort. The salute of Old Glory which had been raised on an American brigantine at port in Frederiksted was a violation of the laws of Denmark-Norway's neutrality however the islands had helped the British colonist in America sealing a friendliness between the two colonies, and the salute was therefore appropriate. 
It is from this fort that Danish Governor-General Peter von Scholten emancipated the slaves on 3 July 1848.  John Gottliff (also known as Moses Gotlieb, General Bordeaux, or Buddhoe) had led 8,000 blacks in a freedom march to Frederiksted.  At the time, there were 17,000 slaves and 5,000 free blacks on St. Croix.The fort includes a museum and art gallery, it is open weekdays from 8:30am to 4pm, and Saturdays from 1pm to 4pm. Admission is $3 (2015).
Fort Frederik was listed as a contributing property in the Frederiksted Historic District in 1976.  It was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.  It was further declared a National Historic Landmark in 1997.Fort Frederik now stands guard over the Eliza James-McBean Clock Tower and Emancipation Park, a town park right in front of the Frederiksted fort and waterfront. The park contains statues of historically important Virgin Islanders. Small paths weave through dozens of large mahogany trees and fragrant flowers. This Federiksted park honors the slave revolt leader General Buddhoe and also serves to recall and honor the 1848 proclamation by Governor Peter von Scholten that emancipated slaves in the Danish islands. The park has many benches and a small gazebo and is the location for Jazz in the Park, every 3rd Friday of the month (2014).

A Man Was Going Down the Road,"A Man Was Going Down the Road (Georgian: გზაზე ერთი კაცი მიდიოდა) is a novel written by  Otar Chiladze in 1973. It was translated into English by Donald Rayfield in 2012.


== Synopsis ==
A Man Was Going Down the Road begins with the Greek legend of Jason and the Golden Fleece and the consequences for the obscure kingdom of Colchis after the Greek Jason comes and abducts Medea. But it is also an allegory of the treachery and destruction that ensued when Russia, and then the Soviets, annexed Georgia, as well as Chiladze's interpretation of life as a version of the ancient Anatolian story of Gilgamesh, and a study of Georgian life, domestic and political, in which women and children pay the price for the hero's quests, obsessions and doubts.


== Plot ==
The novel is written in three parts, spanning generations. The first part, Aeëtes, tells the story of Phrixus and his upbringing by King AEetes, the king of Colchis. In his new land, Phrixos would always be an outsider “like a cuckoo’s egg” and forever in debt to the people who saved him and reared him. This is also the tale of Jason, the Argonauts, and the Golden Fleece. Jason arrives from Greece to steal the golden wool, but kidnaps Medea, the daughter of King AEetes, as she drugs her father in order to also steal the golden fleece of the winged ram. Young and handsome, Jason is regarded as a hero, although a “wrongdoer.”
Part II, Ukheiro, is of a warrior, who breaks his leg in battle. His wife Marekhi dies in childbirth and Ukheiro's 10-year-old daughter Popina looks after her father and the new-born boy, Parnaoz. While waiting for death – for he can no longer fight as a warrior – Ukheiro takes up embroidery. His son Parnaoz falls madly in love with Ino, the seventh daughter of black-eyed Malalo. But theirs is a troubled relationship, and he has a competitor. Parnaoz's sister Popina has a son, Popeye, whose father flees at news of the pregnancy. As Popeye grows, he too falls in the love with Ino. The rivalry between Parnaoz and his nephew Popeye is intense, and Parnaoz eventually leaves Colchis for Crete.
Part III, Parnaoz, is the story of Parnaoz's return to Colchis after about 10 years in Crete. But Ino has not yet married, and the rivalry between Parnaoz and Popeye continues. Parnaoz marries childhood friend, Tina, but he “didn’t care whom he married” for he was “looking for a refuge.. somewhere to hide from Ino.” Tina and Parnaoz soon have a son, little Ukheiro, but Parnaoz now wants to leave his wife. “Parnaoz knew only one thing: whether he got together with Ino or not, he could never accept not being with her, or any substitute life offered, or anything from life.” Interwoven in this section is also the tale of Icarus and Daedalus. In Greek mythology, father and son attempt to flee Crete with waxed and feathered wings. Icarus does not heed his father's warning, and flies too close to the sun. The heat melts the waxed wings, and he falls into the sea and drowns. What follows Parnaoz's disillusionment with his wife, and his constant pining for Ino, is the tragedy that comes from not heeding any warning, and from idealistic and obsessive love.


== Characters ==


=== Characters from the Mythology ===
Aeëtes –  he was a King of Colchis in Greek mythology, son of the sun-god Helios and the Oceanid Perseis (a daughter of Oceanus), brother of Circe and Pasiphaë, and father of Medea, Chalciope and Absyrtus. The name means ""eagle"" (aietos). His consorts were Idyia and either Asterodia the Oceanid, Neaera the Nereid. According to others, he was brother of Perses, a king of Tauris, husband of his niece Hecate, and father of Medea, Chalciope and Absyrtus. Yet other versions make Aeëtes a native of Corinth and son of Ephyra, or else of a certain Antiope.
Medea – is a sorceress who was the daughter of King Aeëtes of Colchis, niece of Circe, granddaughter of the sun god Helios, and later wife to the hero Jason, with whom she had two children, Mermeros and Pheres. In Euripides's play Medea, Jason leaves Medea when Creon, king of Corinth, offers him his daughter, Glauce. The play tells of Medea avenging her husband's betrayal by killing their children.
Absyrtus – was in Greek mythology the son of Aeëtes and a brother of Medea and Chalciope. His mother is variously given: Hyginus calls her Ipsia, Hesiod and the Bibliotheca call her Idyia, Apollonius calls her Asterodeia, and others Neaera or Eurylyte. 
When Medea fled with Jason, she took her brother Absyrtus with her, and when she was nearly overtaken by her father, she murdered her brother, cut his body into pieces and strewed them on the road, so that her father might thus be delayed by gathering the limbs of his child. Tomi, the place where this occurred, was believed to have derived its name from temno (τέμνω, ""cut"").Jason – he was an ancient Greek mythological hero who was famous for his role as the leader of the Argonauts and their quest for the Golden Fleece. He was the son of Aeson, the rightful king of Iolcos. He was married to the sorceress Medea.  Because he belongs to mythology, he may have existed before the Greek Dark Ages (1100–800 BC.) The people who wrote about Jason lived around 300 BC.
Jason appeared in various literary works in the classical world of Greece and Rome, including the epic poem Argonautica and the tragedy Medea. In the modern world, Jason has emerged as a character in various adaptations of his myths, such as the 1963 film Jason and the Argonauts and the 2000 miniseries of the same name. Jason is also the main character in the British television series Atlantis.
Minos – he was the first King of Crete, son of Zeus and Europa. Every nine years, he made King Aegeus pick seven young boys and seven young girls to be sent to Daedalus' creation, the labyrinth, to be eaten by the Minotaur. After his death, Minos became a judge of the dead in the underworld. The Minoan civilization of Crete has been named after him by the archaeologist Arthur Evans. By his wife, Pasiphaë (or some say Crete), he fathered Ariadne, Androgeus, Deucalion, Phaedra, Glaucus, Catreus, Acacallis and Xenodice. By a nymph, Pareia, he had four sons, Eurymedon, Nephalion, Chryses and Philolaus, who were killed by Heracles in revenge for the murder of the latter's two companions; and by Dexithea, one of the Telchines, he had a son called Euxanthius. By Androgeneia of Phaestus he had Asterion, who commanded the Cretan contingent in the war between Dionysus and the Indians. Also given as his children are Euryale, possibly the mother of Orion with Poseidon, and Pholegander, eponym of the island Pholegandros.Icarus –  In Greek mythology, Icarus (the Latin spelling, conventionally adopted in English;  Ancient Greek: Ἴκαρος, Íkaros, Etruscan: Vikare) is the son of the master craftsman Daedalus, the creator of the Labyrinth. Often depicted in art, Icarus and his father attempt to escape from Crete by means of wings that his father constructed from feathers and wax. Icarus's father warns him first of complacency and then of hubris, asking that he fly neither too low nor too high, so the sea's dampness would not clog his wings or the sun's heat melt them. Icarus ignored his father's instructions not to fly too close to the sun, whereupon the wax in his wings melted and he fell into the sea. This tragic theme of failure at the hands of hubris contains similarities to that of Phaëthon.
Daedalus – he was a skillful craftsman and artist. He is the father of Icarus, the uncle of Perdix and possibly also the father of Iapyx although this is unclear.


== Major themes ==
Chiladze wrote A Man Was Going Down the Road in the early 1970s while Georgia was still a part of the Soviet Union. The book is allegorical. In the story of how Colchis was overrun by outsiders – and native Colchians like Popeye were turned into informants and torturers – Chiladze is telling Georgia's story.
As Bochia talked, he too was amazed how everything took on a fairy-tale wonder and enchantment, things that hitherto only he had known that had been permanently deposited, together with countless other memories, in the depths of his heart and, perhaps, had thus lost their colour and meaning, like grandmother's wedding dress. But now, brought into the sunlight, taken out of the trunk, aired in the breeze, in front of so many curious grandchildren, it not only recovered its original softness and lightness, it reanimated its owner's intoxicating virginity, the quivering as her wedding was prepared. People's hearts swelled with pride, they choked on belated tears, and an equally belated regret distressed them, because they had so easily and casually forgotten such a fine, beautiful grandmother whose grave they could no longer find, if only to clear it of weeds and sit just for a minute at her feet (415–16).

The painter Godfried Schalcken sees his true love, Rose, the niece of the artist Gerrit Dou, wedded by contract for a large sum of money to Vanderhausen of Rotterdam, a strange and ghostly figure. Filled with dread, Rose begs Schalcken to run off with her to save her from the marriage, but he is cowardly and ambitious and wants to continue his studies with Dou; instead he says he will buy back the marriage contract when he is successful.
The marriage goes ahead as agreed, and nothing is heard of Rose until she escapes some time later and returns home distraught and starving and begging for protection, but she is pursued by her ghostly husband and disappears.
On the death of Dou a melancholy Schalcken lingers in the church after the funeral service, where a terrifying encounter with his former love leaves his senses reeling.

== Production ==
A fictional tale woven round the lives of actual historic figures, the television film is a 70-minute-long adaptation of Le Fanu's 1839 gothic tale ""Strange Event in the Life of Schalken  [sic] the Painter"", directed and adapted by Leslie Megahey. When Megahey was offered the opportunity to oversee Omnibus, the BBC’s long-running arts documentary series, he accepted on condition that he could make Schalcken the Painter. He shot the film in the style of a docudrama, using a minimum of dialogue. Megahey has stated that he was influenced in the making of the film by the Polish director Walerian Borowczyk, whose 1971 film Blanche also shows the fate of a young woman being decided by rich men, without consideration of her feelings or opinions.Like the earlier Whistle and I'll Come to You, Schalcken the Painter was listed as an episode of Omnibus. It aired on 23 December 1979, filling the slot traditionally taken in previous years by the BBC’s A Ghost Story for Christmas.The actor Vincent Price was initially considered for the Narrator but it was decided his voice would be ""too camp"", and Peter Cushing turned down the role as being too dark. Finally the actor Charles Gray was cast. Arthur Lowe of Dad's Army fame was considered for the role of Gerrit Dou, but he was unavailable and the role went instead to Maurice Denham.The sets and atmospheric lighting used in the film are based on the backgrounds of the paintings by Vermeer. Paintings by Schalcken showing young women holding candles in dark rooms are used throughout the drama, but the final image, again showing a young candlelit woman, but this time with a man in the shadowy background drawing his sword, was created for the film, based on the style of Schalcken.Megahey subsequently used the same narrative device of combining historical figures with the paintings of the lead subject on the 1987 production Cariani and the Courtesans.

Where the Action Is,"Where the Action Is is a music-based television variety show that aired in the United States from 1965 to 1967.  It was carried by the ABC network and aired each weekday afternoon. Created by Dick Clark as a spin-off of American Bandstand, Where the Action Is premiered on June 28, 1965.  The show was another step in the then-current trend of entertainment programs that targeted the teenage audience by focusing on pop music, following in the footsteps of Shindig! (premiered in the fall of 1964, also on ABC) and Hullabaloo (premiered January 1965 on NBC). Dick Clark's voice could be heard doing the artist introductions, and he sometimes did filmed interviews.


== Background ==
The show was hosted by Linda Scott and Steve Alaimo, who sang numbers between guest performances. Ms. Scott had a few hit singles as a teenager in the early 1960s; she was only 20 when ""Action"" premiered. Also appearing were Keith Allison (a Paul McCartney look-alike who later became a member of Paul Revere and the Raiders) and Laura Nyro. Typically, the show featured two or three performers lip-synching their recent hits with a bunch of teenagers clapping and swaying in the background, and a dance segment featuring the Action dancers.  There would occasionally be an interview segment.  A few episodes featured only one performer, such as Herman's Hermits or James Brown.
Originally intended as a summer replacement and broadcast at 2 P.M. EDT, the show was successful enough for it to continue throughout the 1965–66 TV season, with a change in time period to 4:30 P.M. Eastern time following the horror soap opera Dark Shadows. Both programs attracted a young audience who watched the shows after school.  It was in black and white.
The show's theme song, ""Action"", became a hit single for Freddy ""Boom Boom"" Cannon, peaking on the charts (#13) in September 1965. Most of these black-and-white telecasts were taped at various locales in Southern California. A handful of segments were taped elsewhere around the US. The theme song was written by Steve Venet and Tommy Boyce. Later, Boyce co-wrote songs for The Monkees.
The program had its own stable of performers, most notably Paul Revere & the Raiders, who served as the de facto house band.  Easily identified by their Revolutionary War costumes, the band had several Top 40 hits in the '60s thanks in part to the exposure they received on ""Where The Action Is"".  Their lead singer, Mark Lindsay, with his signature ponytail, became one of the most popular teenage idols of the decade, gracing the covers of countless teen magazines.  The Raiders also recorded the ""Action"" theme song for their 1965 album ""Just Like Us"" for which Dick Clark wrote the liner notes.  When the group departed the show in 1966, they were replaced by The Robbs and The Hard Times.  Other regular performers on Action included the dance troupe Pete Menefee and the Action Kids.  Individual episodes featured a wide range of guest performers, as detailed below.  Tina Mason was a regular singer being promoted by Dick Clark on the show. She met on the set and later married Phil Volk, the bass player for Paul Revere and the Raiders.  They married on the second anniversary of the show's premiere, June 27, 1967.
The weekday program was cancelled on March 31, 1967, with the network giving its local affiliates the time slot.  However, members of the program's mainstay band Paul Revere and the Raiders (with lead vocalist Mark Lindsay) hosted very similar follow-up shows: both Revere and Lindsay hosted Happening '68, a Saturday afternoon follow-up to American Bandstand, and a weekday version of the same show, It's Happening, from 1968 to 1969. Both shows were produced by Dick Clark's production company for ABC.


== Font inspired by the show's name ==
By the late 1990s, Alaimo worked in the recording industry with typeface enthusiast Jeff N. Levine, who noticed an interesting typeface spelling out the show's title on a photo album Steve kept from those years. The typeface was similar to ""Caruso Roxy"", a psychedelic-style typeface by Victor Caruso. Tracing the letters which existed on that page, and creating his own characters for those that were missing, the font was digitized by Brad O. Nelson of Brain Eaters Fonts and released as freeware under the name ""Action Is"". The font became a favorite, and was nicknamed ""the Austin Powers font"" after the movie and because of its quirky 60's-70's appeal. The typeface was popular throughout the 2000s, and many still use it today. The font even spawned an extension version also done by Jeff Levine, dubbed ""Groovy Happening JNL"", which sold well on MyFonts.

Will Alma,"Will Alma, OAM (born Oswald George William Bishop; 4 November 1904 – 6 May 1993) was an Australian stage magician, maker of conjuring apparatus and magic historian. He is perhaps best known for his curation and donation of the 'WG Alma Conjuring Collection' to State Library Victoria.


== Early years ==
Oswald George William Bishop was born in Malvern, Australia. His parents were Oswald Henry Bishop, a tinsmith by trade and a stage magician who performed under the stage name 'Alma, the Court Magician', and Rosetta Mary Long, a piano teacher. He was an only child. After his father abandoned the family and moved to the US, his mother forbade the young Bishop (later Alma) from considering magic as a career.


== Career ==
After acquiring a copy of Magic Made Easy by David Devant, Bishop studied magic in secret, against his mother's wishes. His first performance was at an amateur talent contest at the Burke Road Congregational Church in Malvern at the age of 15 – after which his mother accepted and supported his career as a stage magician.In 1949, Bishop changed his name by deed poll to William George Alma. He enjoyed a successful career as a performer and a manufacturer of conjuring apparatus and props, with a particular highlight being touring Australia and New Zealand with Levante as Technical Adviser and Technician Levante's 'How's Tricks' show.After having a heart attack, Alma retired from performing and turned his attention to curating the collection of magic memorabilia which would later become the WG Alma Conjuring Collection.In 1991 he was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia on the Queen's Birthday public holiday ""for service as a magician and to the conservation of conjuring memorabilia."" In the same year he received a Presidential Citation from the International Brotherhood of Magicians for his services to magic.


== WG Alma Conjuring Collection ==
The WG Alma Conjuring Collection, housed at State Library Victoria, is an extensive archive of magic-related material including but not limited to: props, posters, books, magazines, scale models of tricks and research files.Originally a solo project, Alma began working in conjunction with the library to grow the collection in later life, acting as an honorary curator and adviser before bequeathing the full collection to the library upon his death in 1993.

Frank Joseph Zirbel,"Frank Joseph Zirbel (born 1947) is an American musician, composer, filmmaker and self-taught artist. His work looks at the darker side of being human, satirizing the human condition while celebrating it at the same time. In 1978, he learned how to etch and to this day continues to make prints. In 1979, he became the bass player for the Chicago new wave band, Bohemia. The band went on to tour the United States playing various sized clubs in 1983 and the first half of 1984. He wrote many of Bohemia's more notable songs on their five vinyl releases, including ""Automatic Mind,"" ""Empty Room,""  ""No Ordinary Moon,"" and ""Love Turns to Stone."" The Beatles, The Doors and Chicago blues had a big impact on his writing style. For instance, ""Love Turns to Stone,"" is based on only one chord. After Bohemia broke up in mid 1984, Zirbel waited a year and in 1985 started his own label, Pteranodon Ltd. Editions, and began releasing his own material over the next decades, including ""Anatomy of a Pig,"" (cassette), ""Skull Tracks,"" (CD - EP), ""Two-Headed Fly"" (CD with two EPs), and ""Live at the Big Horse Lounge"" (CD - EP). Several Chicago blues and jazz musicians appeared on his ""Skull Tracks"" CD, including Sunnyland Slim, Carey Bell, Barrett Deems, and Howard Levy.
Since the early 1970s he has produced and directed several short films and rock videos. He often did his own camera work and editing. Gene Siskel took notice of his film, ""Duck Eggs and the Miniature Rooster,"" and interviewed Zirbel live during the first showing of the film on Night Watch in 1977 (name soon changed to Image Union) on Chicago's PBS channel. His film ""She-Wolf"" was shown at the Chicago Underground Film Festival in 2000 and at the Stuttgart Film Festival in 2001. Zirbel's most recent movie, ""Reptilian Calculations,"" received its world premier at the Paris Short Film Festival in May 2018. It's the fifth episode from the 46 minute compilation, ""Seven Gnarled Tales of the Unholy."" His drawings on found paper may be one of his most noted series along with the ""Asylum"" drawings which he did while working at a mental hospital in the mid 1970s.
In 1985, he went on a trip to New York to promote his music and art. The first East Village gallery he approached, Eastman Wahmendorf, placed him in a show and subsequently others. In late November 1986 with the promptings of his gallery, he moved to New York and took up residence at the Times Square Motor Hotel where he resided until moving back to Chicago in mid-1987.
Zirbel has forty years of print making experience. In 2018, he was invited to exhibit multiple states of his etchings at the Jinling Art Museum, in Nanjing, China.
In addition to creating etchings, Zirbel paints, draws and sculpts.


== Life ==
Frank Joseph Zirbel was born in Green Bay, Wisconsin in 1947. In 1970, he graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Madison, with a bachelor of arts degree in Philosophy. His first group show dates back to 1973 at Edgewood Orchard Gallery in Door County, Wisconsin. More than 70 group and several one-man shows have followed. Since 1977, he has made Chicago his home base.Zirbel moved to New York in November, 1986 (upon encouragement by his East Village N.Y. art dealer, Joseph Sipos – Helio Gallery). In New York, he resided in the Times Square Hotel, 255 W.43rd St. While in New York he struck up a friendship with the N.Y. artist Chaim Koppleman who let him start using his Soho etching studio as a place to work. In mid-summer 1987, Zirbel returned to Chicago.


== Work ==
Zirbel’s art uses representational imagery within the stylistic modes of figurative expressionism and classical surrealism.He started drawing as a child and is primarily self-taught. His first etchings date to 1978. He started showing art in New York’s East Village in 1985 and for many years thereafter, with twelve N.Y. shows in the late 1980s. Also, Zirbel started oil painting and working in color during this time period, encouraged to do so by his New York dealer who invited him to be in a 1986 exhibition of paintings.Zirbel has claimed that his initial drawing style came together in the second half of the 1970s while he was working the midnight shift in admissions at the Elgin Mental Health Center, Elgin, Illinois. Here, having previously worked on all the various wards, and with extra time on his hands between admissions, he created unique black-and-white ink drawings inspired by the psychotic and the insane. During his employ at the hospital, Zirbel also made a 16mm documentary film titled ""Duck Eggs and the Miniature Rooster"" containing an interview with Hermine Pakrovsky, one of the hospital's revolving-door patients. The film made its television debut on Chicago's local PBS affiliate in 1977. Zirbel's dark novel ""The Idiot's Grasp"" was inspired by his work at the hospital. The novel is now housed in the Museum of Modern Art's artists book collection. In late 1998, Chattanooga, Tennessee art dealer Angela Usrey discovered these works and consigned a few, awarding Zirbel a show at her gallery. In January, 1999, she exhibited these works at New York’s Outsider Art Fair. Usrey named them the ""Asylum Drawings."" Her Tanner Hill Gallery continued exhibiting this series at the N.Y. Outsider art fair through 2012.
Zirbel often has worked in series-related art. One such series, ""The Messenger Street Drawing Series"" (early 1990s) was inspired by the urban images he saw while working as a bicycle messenger in Chicago. In November 1995, a month after Zirbel quit being a messenger, the Chicago photographer, Mark Debernardi, did a raw video interview with him in his studio reflecting on Zirbel's five year stint on the street. Included in the piece are some works from the messenger drawing series itself. A 1997 exhibition of these drawings at the Judith Racht Gallery, Chicago, garnered Zirbel Chicago Magazine’s selection as Chicago’s best undiscovered artist for that year.Another set of works revolving around a single theme, Zirbel's ""Influencing Artists Series"", expanded into etchings, paintings, collage and assemblage and explores the faces and personalities of those who inspired him. In 2005, Susan Aurinko’s Flatfile Galleries, Chicago, presented a surrealist show featuring several paintings from this series, including portraits of Luis Bunuel, Rene Magritte, and an extensive etching series on Edgar Allan Poe.
In  late 2015, The Art Center - Highland Park invited Zirbel to exhibit many of his found object sculptures in a group show. 2016 witnessed a drawing of his being chosen for the Williams College Museum of Art's Walls Collection, in Williamstown, Massachusetts. In 2017, two portraits of Nelson Algren by Zirbel (a painting/collage and a monotype) were purchased by collectors and loaned to the Nelson Algren Museum of Miller Beach, Gary, Ind. for an indefinite time period.
On YouTube, Zirbel's many films and videos can be seen on his film channel, Frank Joseph Zirbel. Recent additions include two films, ""The Human Riddle,"" and ""The Mask and the Mirror,"" from the compilation, ""Seven Gnarled Tales of the Unholy,"" based on drawings he did after Pieter Bruegel's ""Seven Deadly Sins"" engravings. This set of seven drawings is titled, ""Quicksand and Quagmire."" The film is an American/German co-production with animation and camera work completed in Munich by Mike Hans Steffl.
In 2018, ""Reptilian Calculations,"" the fifth episode of ""Seven Gnarled Tales of the Unholy,"" premiered on May 9 at the Paris Short Film Festival. The film was also selected for showing during Poland's all summer out door film festival, On Art - Poland, based out of Warsaw, Poland. In August, it received an Honorable Mention at the Los Angeles Experimental Forum Festival and then was chosen for exhibition in late November at the Directors Circle Festival of Shorts, in Erie, Pennsylvania.

Hartman Bache,"Hartman Bache (September 3, 1798 – October 8, 1872) was an American military engineer who participated in the construction of many of the earliest lighthouses on the West Coast.  He made a number of sketches of these lighthouses and light stations which have since become an important resource in the study of American lighthouses.  He was also involved in the construction of railroads, canals, and defenses.
Hartman Bache was the youngest son of journalist Benjamin Franklin Bache (who died a week after his birth) and the great grandson of Benjamin Franklin.  He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1818. Despite his low class rank (19th out of 23), he was immediately commissioned as a Captain in the Corps of Topographical Engineers. In 1829 he married Maria del Carmen Meade, the daughter of merchant Richard W. Meade and sister of Civil War general George Meade.In 1831, Bache was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.At the start of the Civil War in 1861, Bache was a lighthouse engineer with the rank of major. Shortly afterwards, he succeeded John James Abert as Chief of Topographical Engineers, spending much of the war serving on the East Coast. He was brevetted to brigadier general in March 1865, and retired in March 1867. Bache died in his hometown of Philadelphia, and was buried in Woodlands Cemetery.

Won Ung-hui,"Won Ung-hui (Korean: 원응희) (born 1939- died May 15, 2004) was a North Korean politician and military officer, served as commander of the Military Security Command of the Korean People's Army. He was a member of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, and member of the Supreme People's Assembly. He holds the rank of General.


== Biography ==
Won Ung-hui became major general of the Korean People's Army in 1983. Five years later, he was elected to the alternate member of the Party Central Committee. In the election to the 9th convocation of the Supreme People's Assembly in 1990, he was elected as a member for the first time and served as a political member of the Air Force Command. At the same time, he was promoted to lieutenant general and minister of the People's Armed Forces. The following year, he was promoted to general and member of the Central Committee of the WPK. In 1992, he was appointed as the commander of the Military Security Command of the Korean People's Army. In July 1994, he was awarded the rank of general and following the death of Kim Il Sung he was member of his funeral committee.
In December 1995, Won Ung-hui was appointed commander of the Defense Command of the Ministry of People's Armed Forces. A year later, a coup d’état of the VI Corps, which wanted to overthrow Kim Jong Il, broke out. After receiving information, Kim Jong Il ’s Supreme Guard Command successfully suppressed the attempted coup. Since then, the Military Security Command led by Won Ung-hui has lost momentum. At the same time, even though Won Ung-hui was successfully re-elected in the election for the 10th convocation of the Supreme People's Assembly, he has been neglected by Kim Jong Il. In 2003, Won Ung-hui retired and died on May 15, 2004, of liver cancer.

Nimco Ali,"Nimko Ali  (Somali: Nimco Cali), alternatively spelled Nimco (born c. 1982), is a British social activist of Somali heritage. She is the co-founder and CEO of The Five Foundation, a global partnership to end female genital mutilation (FGM). 
Ali underwent female genital mutilation in Djibouti. She released her first book in 2019 that contains 42 stories from 152 interviews that Ali collected from women across 14 countries. Later that year she co-founded The Five Foundation with Brendan Wynne, which is her current full tine role. 
In 2020, she also co-founded the Ginsburg Women's Health Board with Mika Simmons. She contested a seat in the 2017 general election under the Women's Equality Party. In 2019, she supported Boris Johnson, endorsed the Conservative Party and campaigned for Conservative candidates. She was appointed as Independent Government Adviser for Tackling Violence Against Women and Girls in 2020, a post which ended in 2022.


== Early life ==
Ali was born c. 1983 in Somalia. When she was four, her family moved to Manchester in England later moving to Cardiff, Wales. She has four brothers, one of whom, Mohamed, is chair of the Somali Conservatives. Aged seven, Ali underwent female genital mutilation (FGM) in Djibouti while on holiday with her family. She later suffered health complications and had to undergo reconstructive surgery. The experience, and meeting other females who had been incised later inspired her to assist at-risk girls and to call for the practice's eradication. Ali studied law at Bristol University.


== Career ==
In 2010, Ali along with psychotherapist Leyla Hussein founded Daughters of Eve. The non-profit organisation was established to help young women and girls, with a focus on providing education and raising awareness on female genital mutilation.Ali co-founded The Five Foundation, ""The Global Partnership to End FGM"", with Brendan Wynne in 2019. This non-profit organisation works to raise the issue of FGM on the international agenda and leverage funding for grassroots organisations working to end FGM. Ali previously worked as a civil servant. She also served as a women's rights activist and an independent training consultant for a number of years. Additionally, Ali served as a Network Coordinator for The Girl Generation. She has also written extensively on national gender rights.
Her book What We’re Told Not to Talk About (But We're Going to Anyway): Women's Voices from East London to Ethiopia was published by Penguin Books in June 2019. It includes stories of women who are sharing experiences they have always been told should be ""secret and shameful"" as well as Ali's own story of living with FGM. The book contained 42 stories from 152 interviews that Ali had undertaken with women across 14 countries. In The Times, Hannah Betts described the book as ""a compelling cross-cultural account of vaginal life"". Isobel Shirlaw said in i that it was an important book and that ""The chorus of women's voices which provide a multi-dimensional, global view of these hidden issues is powerful"". The Guardian review by Arifa Akbar praised the book as ""rich collection of intimate and uncensored stories"" and wrote that Ali ""delivers the physicality of the women's experiences with all the leaking, faecal, bloody mess of the body laid bare"", although noting that ""deeper reflection is lacking"" and criticising the omission of coverage of anyone that was not heterosexual and cisgender. Ali told an interviewer from The Guardian that: ""Since the age of seven, when I started talking about my vagina after FGM, I was told that I should be ashamed. But I wouldn't have been talking about these things if FGM hadn't happened to me. FGM was the patriarchy's way of trying to break me and keep me silent, but it made me the loudest person in the room.""
In 2020, Ali and Mika Simmons co-founded the Ginsburg Women's Health Board, to campaign for a more effective and equitable healthcare system for women from the National Health Service. The organisation is named after Ruth Bader Ginsburg.Home Secretary of the United Kingdom Priti Patel appointed Ali as an Independent Government Adviser for Tackling Violence Against Women and Girls, in October 2020. Ali was a direct appointment to the role, which, as is common with such roles, was not advertised. The role involves the formulation of a strategy to reduce violence against women and girls, with recommendations expected to be produced in 2021. The report, with forewords from Priti Patel and from Ali, was published in July 2021. Ali expressed her hope that the strategy would be a foundation to improve safety for women and girls through education and legislation, but that ""whole system"" change would be required to reduce violence. In December 2022 Ali said she does not want to serve under new Conservative Home Secretary Suella Braverman and was on a ""completely different planet"" to Braverman on women's rights and ethnic minorities.


== Political activity ==
At the 2017 general election, Ali contested the seat of Hornsey and Wood Green in North London for the Women's Equality Party. Ali polled 551 votes (0.9% of the total), finishing in 5th place out of the 8 candidates that stood and losing her election deposit. During the campaign, Ali's campaign workers received dozens of abusive and aggressive telephone calls, and Ali received a death threat.Ali is godmother to the son of Boris Johnson, the former prime minister of the United Kingdom, and his wife Carrie Johnson. She endorsed Johnson, who she has referred to as a ""real feminist"", in the 2019 Conservative leadership election. During the 2019 general election, Ali campaigned on behalf of the Conservatives.


== Honours and awards ==
In 2014, Ali received the community/charity award, jointly with Leyla Hussein, at the 2014 Red Magazine Woman of the Year awards for their work with Daughters of Eve.

VentureStar,"VentureStar was a single-stage-to-orbit reusable launch system proposed by Lockheed Martin and funded by the U.S. government. The goal was to replace the Space Shuttle by developing a re-usable spaceplane that could launch satellites into orbit at a fraction of the cost. While the requirement was for an uncrewed launcher, it was expected to carry passengers as cargo. The VentureStar would have had a wingspan of 68 feet (20.7 m), a length of 127 feet (38.7 m), and would have weighed roughly 1000 t (2.2 million lb).
VentureStar was intended to be a commercial single-stage-to-orbit vehicle that would be launched vertically, but return to Earth as an airplane. Flights would have been leased to NASA as needed. After failures with the X-33 subscale technology demonstrator test vehicle, funding was cancelled in 2001.
VentureStar was essentially a bigger version of the X-33 but was not produced. The X-33 had ongoing problems meeting performance requirements for the carbonfibre hydrogen fuel tank. There were a number of other technologies that were part of the program, including the linear aerospike rocket engine. One point of praise was the metallic thermal protection system developed by BF Goodrich.


== Advantages ==
VentureStar's engineering and design would have offered numerous advantages over the Space Shuttle, representing considerable savings in time and materials, as well as increased safety.  VentureStar was expected to launch satellites into orbit at about 1/10 the cost of the Shuttle.
Readying VentureStar for flight would have dramatically differed from that of the Space Shuttle.  Unlike the Space Shuttle orbiter, which had to be lifted and assembled together with several other heavy components (a large external tank, plus two solid rocket boosters), VentureStar was to be simply inspected in a hangar like an airplane.Also unlike the Space Shuttle, VentureStar would not have relied upon solid rocket boosters, which had to be hauled out of the ocean and then refurbished after each launch.  Furthermore, design specifications called for the use of linear aerospike engines that maintain thrust efficiency at all altitudes,  whereas the Shuttle relied upon conventional nozzle engines which achieve maximum efficiency at only a certain altitude.VentureStar would have used a new metallic thermal protection system, safer and cheaper to maintain than the ceramic protection system used on the Space Shuttle. VentureStar's metallic heat shield would have eliminated 17,000 between-flight maintenance hours typically required to satisfactorily check (and replace if needed) the thousands of heat-resistant ceramic tiles that compose the Shuttle exterior.VentureStar was expected to be safer than most modern rockets. Whereas most modern rockets fail catastrophically when an engine fails, VentureStar would have a thrust reserve in each engine in the event of an emergency.  For example, if an engine on VentureStar failed during ascent, another engine would shut off to counterbalance the failed thrust, and each of the remaining working engines could throttle up to safely continue the mission.Unlike the Space Shuttle, whose solid rocket boosters produced chemical wastes, primarily hydrogen chloride, during launch, VentureStar's exhaust would have been composed of only water vapor, since VentureStar's main fuels would have been only liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. This would have given VentureStar the benefit of being environmentally clean. VentureStar's simpler design would have excluded hypergolic propellants and even hydraulics, relying instead upon electrical power for flight controls, doors and landing gear.Because of its lighter design, VentureStar would have been able to land at almost any major airport in an emergency, whereas the Space Shuttle required much longer runways than available at most public airports.

The VentureStar program was cancelled due to development cost concerns accompanied by technical problems and failures in the X-33 program, a program which was intended as proof-of-concept for some of the critical technologies needed by the VentureStar. The failure during a test of the X-33's complex, multi-lobe composite-structure cryogenic hydrogen tank was one of the main reasons for the cancellation of both the X-33 and the VentureStar. Ultimately, the VentureStar program required too many technical advances at too high a cost to be viable.


== Program hardware ==
Examples:
Metallic TPS
XRS-2200 Linear aerospike main engines
LOX tanksOne of the technological barriers at the time was the hydrogen fuel tank. One positive was that several years later the performance requirements for such a hydrogen tank were achieved, as NASA gained more experience with cryogenic carbon fiber fuel tanks.September 7, 2004, Northrop Grumman and NASA engineers unveiled a liquid hydrogen tank made of carbon fiber composite material that had demonstrated the ability for repeated fuelings and simulated launch cycles. The tank was a simple cylinder, not the complex shape used for the X-33. Northrop Grumman concluded that these successful tests have enabled the development and refinement of new manufacturing processes that will allow the company to build large composite tanks without an autoclave; and design and engineering development of conformal fuel tanks appropriate for use on a single-stage-to-orbit vehicle.


== In fiction ==
In the 2001 novella and 2015 novel Lash-Up by Larry Bond and Chris Carlson, the VentureStar prototype is converted into an armed spacecraft named Defender in order to protect US space assets from China, which is using a space gun to destroy GPS satellites.In John Varley's novel Red Thunder and sequels, one of the major protagonists is a former VentureStar pilot.
In the television series Star Trek: Enterprise, an operational VentureStar spaceplane is included in the opening credits as part of the history of human spaceflight.In the television series Space Island One, a fleet of VentureStars resupply the titular commercial space station.

2009 Eastern Congo offensive,"The 2009 Eastern Congo offensive was a joint Congo-Rwanda military offensive against the Hutu Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) rebel group descended from those groups that carried out the 1994 Rwanda genocide. Two operations were carried out: 'Kimia II' and 'Umoja Wetu.' 'Kimia' can be translated as 'calm.' ""Umoja Wetu"" is Swahili for ""Our Unity"".


== Timeline ==
Rwanda and the DRC made an agreement to rout out elements of the FDLR from eastern Congo. On 20 January 2009, 1,000 Rwandan soldiers poured over the border into eastern Congo near Goma and were working, according to United Nations officials, as advisers for the Congolese troops.On 23 January 2009, some rebels had started to surrender to Rwandan and Congolese troops.First reports of fighting came on 24 January 2009, when the Congolese army reported they killed nine FDLR militiamen. In response the rebels claimed they didn't lose any men and that the Congolese military itself suffered nine soldiers killed and one wounded in a clash with a group of Mai-Mai militiamen. By this time the FDLR was in retreat from Southern into Northern Kivu province and the number of Rwandan soldiers in the region reached 5,000.
On 26 January 2009, rebels tried to retake the village of Kasinga, but were repulsed by Congolese and Rwandan soldiers in fighting that killed four militiamen.
On 18 February 2009, air strikes killed 40 rebels 5 kilometers west of Goma.Rwandan forces withdrew on 27 February 2009.

Lake in the Hills Airport,"Lake in the Hills Airport (FAA LID: 3CK) is a public airport located at 8407 Pyott Road in Lake in the Hills, a village in McHenry County, Illinois, United States. The airport is owned by the Village of Lake in the Hills and is located 38 miles (61 km) northwest of the central business district of Chicago. It is a designated Federal Aviation Administration reliever airport for Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.


== History ==
Lake in the Hills Airport was founded in 1957. Then called Crystal Lake Airport, it was privately owned. The Village of Lake in the Hills acquired the airport in 1984.


=== Redevelopment program ===
Pyott Road, to the east of the airport, was relocated to create an improved Runway Safety Area. A new parallel taxiway, capable of operating as a temporary runway, has also been built in addition to a larger primary aircraft parking apron, and a new general aviation terminal will be constructed. Improvements will also be made to drainage, utilities and support facilities.
In 2014, the airport built a new fuel farm and moved old fuel tanks that were too close to the runway, a project that cost about $760,000. In July 2016, construction began for the final phase of the airport's improvement project. In the project, the former airport office building was demolished to make way for a new taxiway, in order to move it away from the runway, which is being redone and widened from 50 feet (15 m) to 75 feet (23 m) to meet Federal Aviation Administration standards. The taxiway was completed in November 2016, and the entire project is expected to be completed in 2022, with the runway expansion expected to cost $5 million.Because of continued success in advancing this safety improvement program, the airport was named 2010 Reliever Airport of the Year in Illinois by the Illinois Division of Aeronautics. The airport also won this distinction in 2019.


== Facilities and aircraft ==
Lake in the Hills Airport covers an area of 72 acres (29 ha) at an elevation of 888 ft (271 m). It has one runway designated 8/26 with a 3,801 x 50 ft (1,159 x 15 m) asphalt pavement. The airport is uncontrolled and is open to the public.For the 12-month period ending August 30, 2019, the airport had 34,000 aircraft operations, an average of 93 per day; all were general aviation. In January 2017, there were 101 aircraft based at this airport: 92 single-engine, 7 multi-engine and 4 jet.FBO services are provided by the Village of Lake in the Hills, offering both full and self-service 100LL and Jet A fuel.Flight training and supplies provided by Blue Skies Flying Services. Pilot Flight Training Courses, another flight training school, opened its doors in March 2017.A courtesy vehicle is available at the airport for use during business hours.


== Ground transportation ==
While no public transit service is provided directly to the airport, Pace provides bus service nearby.


== Accidents and incidents ==
On September 3, 2007, a Yakovlev Yak 52 impacted terrain shortly after takeoff from Lake in the Hills' Runway 26. Witnesses reported the aircraft entered a ""violent"" left turn before the engine ""gave out,"" and the aircraft descended. Both people on board were killed. Ultimately, the NTSB was unable to determine a reason for the crash.
On May 3, 2012, a Beechcraft Bonanza 35 crashed a half mile east of the airport. Both passengers on board were killed.
On June 8, 2017, a Beechcraft Baron landed with its landing gear up. Neither person on board was injured.

== Career ==
Prof. Byrnes writes ""In 538 Diarmait mac Cerbaill’s brother Maine (the coincidence of his name is quite fortuitous) was defeated and slain at the battle of Claenloch near Gort in south Galway. According to the Annals of Tigernach, a Clonmacnoise compilation, he was slain by the king of the Ui Fiachrach Aidne, Goibnenn mac Conaill, while attempting to claim the claim the homage of the Ui Maine Connacht. In the later king-lists Maine mac Cerbaill is called king of Uisnech. In the minds of compilers this meant that he was over-king of the Southern Ui Neill, but this is probably an anachronism, especially since Tuathal Maelgarb is supposed to have been high-king of Tara at this date.""

He started to learn how to draw from well-known artist Lee Sang-beom when he was 16 years old, but did not enter university at the age of 27. Since he started upper education quite late, he started to learn how to describe and draw different kinds of paintings such as figures and still-life objects. His nickname is ""the artist of jar"" since his works largely used jars in his drawings.
According to the National Arts Institute of Korea, he is said to combine oriental drawings with modern materials such as acrylic paints. Recently, he expanded his reputation by re-interpreting 15c drawing of Ahn Gyeon.

Sugar Bowl Regatta,"The Sugar Bowl Regatta has been held since 1934. The races have taken place on Lake Pontchartrain every year since 1935, except during World War II and immediately after Hurricane Katrina in 2006. Lake Pontchartrain is a 630 square mile lake with a mean depth of 10–16 feet.The sailing competition is divided into two separate phases, over four two-day periods, beginning in late November and concluding on New Year's Eve. The sailing competition typically features more than 200 sailboats divided into separate divisions. Sailing crews from all over the United States, including intercollegiate and high school teams compete in the regatta.The races were originally conducted by the Southern Yacht Club (SYC), America's second-oldest yacht club, but are currently conducted in conjunction with the New Orleans Yacht Club.


== History ==
The Sugar Bowl Regatta was established in 1934 by the Midwinter Sports Association to be part of a winter carnival of sports offerings in conjunction with the Sugar Bowl football game. The regatta is the only non-football event that has continued in the same format for the entirety of the Sugar Bowl organization. The ""Race of Champions"" (ROC) has been a premier Sugar Bowl Regatta race involving the Gulf Yachting Association one-design boats since Davis Wuescher of the Southern Yacht Club captured the first title in 1934.Since that time, the regatta has expanded to its current form that includes many additional classes such as Performance Handicap, Rhodes-19s, Finns, Lightnings, Flying Scots, many Board Boat classes, and several J-Boat fleets. The Sugar Bowl also sponsors the Optimist Mid-winter Championship, the Great Oaks Regatta, and high school and intercollegiate sailing competitions. The ""Race of Champions"" began as a Gulf Yachting Association inter-club competition sailed in the then-popular wooden-hulled gaff-rigged Fish Class, but eventually changed to adopt the fiberglass design, Flying Scott.The Sugar Bowl Regatta has featured multiple Olympians, including Gilbert Gray, who captured Olympic Gold in the STAR class in the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California. George Friedrichs, with crew Barton Jahncke and Gerald Schreck brought home the gold from the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, Mexico in the Dragon class. John C. Lovell, took silver in the Tornado class in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece and competed in the 1996, 2000 and 2008 Summer Olympics. John Dane III became America's oldest Olympian, sailing in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China.The Sugar Bowl ""Race of Champions"" trophy has become a nationally-prestigious prize in sailing. Gilbert Gray won it in 1941, 1946 and 1947, becoming the first sailor to win it three consecutive times (the regatta was not contested during World War II). John Dane III was the first to win in the ""Race of Champions"" in three consecutive years in 1986-88.


== Hurricane Katrina ==
After Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans and the Gulf Coast. The 2006 Sugar Bowl football classic was moved to Atlanta, Georgia and the regatta committee held the intercollegiate races on Lake Lanier in the Atlanta-area thanks to the Lake Lanier Sailing Club and the Georgia Tech sailing team. The balance of the regatta was held on Lake Pontchartrain in New Orleans.

=== 19th century ===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.
In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1855, Leavenworth County was established, and is among the first 33 counties, which were formed by the first territorial government. It was named, as was its county seat, after Henry Leavenworth, an officer in the War of 1812.Leavenworth County had the first Kansas State University extension agent in the State.

Milton Reynolds,"Milton Reynolds (1892–1976), an American entrepreneur, was born ""Milton Reinsberg"" in Albert Lea, Minnesota. He is most famously known for the manufacture and introduction of the first ballpoint pen to be sold in the U.S. market in October 1945. He was also inventor of the “talking sign” promotional placard for retail stores, sponsor and crewman on the twin-engine propeller flight that broke Howard Hughes' round-the-world record, and among the first investors in Syntex, which pioneered the combined oral contraceptive pill, or birth-control pill.Reynolds’ business fortunes and personal wealth rose and fell numerous times during his career. He changed his name because he believed that his customers, including major U.S. retailers, were reluctant to buy from Jews. He had previously tried several ventures that made and lost considerable sums, including trying to corner the market on used automobile tires and investing in prefabricated houses. A business he built around retail signmaking equipment, Reynolds Printasign, was owned and operated by two generations of his heirs.


== Developing the gravity-feed ballpoint ==
A rolling-ball mechanism for marking leather was conceived as early as 1888 by American inventor John Loud. In 1938, newspaper editor László Bíró, a Hungarian-émigré to Argentina, and business partner Henry G. Martin patented a device for marking printers' galleys. The Biro pen used gelatinous ink combined with capillary action to draw the ink out as it was deposited on paper by the rolling-ball tip. Because the pen did not leak at high altitude, the Biro venture sold a quantity of pens to the Royal Air Force for keeping flight logs, under a contract with Myles Aircraft. Subsequently, Biro's company Eterpen, S.A. licensed manufacturing rights in the US to a joint venture between Eversharp and Eberhard Faber.While paying a sales call to Goldblatt's department store in Chicago, Reynolds was shown one of the Biro pens and recognized it as a potentially hot consumer item for the postwar era. Working with engineer William Huernergardt and machinist Titus Haffa, Reynolds came up with a design that did not rely on patented capillary action but caused ink to flow by gravity. However, successful gravity feed required much thinner, viscous ink and a much larger barrel to avoid constant refilling. The thin ink made the pens prone to leakage, but, realizing time was of the essence, Reynolds rushed them to market anyway, touting the high ink capacity. With roller balls repurposed from the metal beads used in war-surplus bomb sights and barrels machined from aircraft aluminum, the Reynolds pens had another feature that captured the popular imagination: In early ads, Reynolds claimed, “It writes under water!” The claim was essentially truthful because his pen wrote successfully on wet paper. Consumers had little use for this bizarre practical application, but a generation of shoppers remembered the slogan long after Reynolds passed into history.


== Introduction ==
Although Eversharp had plans to introduce a pen modeled after Biro's, Reynolds introduced his pen first. Before and during the war, when he sold signmaking equipment to retailers, Reynolds had cultivated personal relationships with the heads of all the department stores. Among these was Fred Gimbel, whose family owned Gimbels in Manhattan, the arch-rival of Macy's. Through an exclusive deal with Gimbel, the Reynolds pen debuted at the 32nd Street store on the morning of October 29, 1945. World War II had just ended (V-J Day was on August 14), so public exuberance was high. The pen sold for $12.50 (equivalent to $203 in 2022). The day the pen went on sale, an estimated 5,000 shoppers stormed Gimbels, and approximately 50 NYPD officers had to be dispatched for crowd control.


== Reynolds International Pen Company ==
The Chicago-based Reynolds International Pen Company made 8 million pens in six weeks, cranking out lathe-turned pens in a manufacturing facility converted from an indoor tennis court. Thereafter came an era chronicled in the print media of the time as the “Pen Wars,” as latecomer Eversharp finally entered the market. Eversharp then sued Reynolds for patent infringement, and Reynolds countersued on the grounds of illegal restraint of trade. Ultimately, the main result of the legal battle was to generate reams of free publicity for both products. Reynolds capitalized on his sudden success by introducing a new model dubbed the “Reynolds Rocket” from the Reynolds International Pen Company. He shipped pens overseas while making partnership overtures, even buying a French estate, le Château du Mesnil-Saint-Denis in 1947, as an intended base of European operations.


== Pen wars ==
Reynolds knew that it was only a matter of time until the established pen manufacturers Eversharp, Parker Pen Company, and Waterman pens flooded the market with much cheaper models backed up with big national advertising campaigns. Rather than compete and watch his margins dwindle, he sold the company off in pieces. European rights to the name went to a French concern, and the Reynolds pen is a well-known French brand today (although the company is just as well known for its inexpensive fountain pens, which schoolchildren use for lessons in cursive penmanship). However, in Britain especially, “Biro” has become the generic term for any ballpoint pen. Many of the parts for the Reynolds Rocket were made by Fisher-Armour Mfg in Chicago. When Reynolds decided to stop selling, Paul C. Fisher, later to found Fisher Pen Company and invent the Fisher Space Pen, decided to try to improve the pen.  He sold the corporate charter to the U.S. government, which renamed it the Reynolds Construction Company and allegedly passed clandestine payments to foreign governments through the paper entity.


== Aviation ==
Reynolds took his profits and indulged his hobby, a lifelong love of flying. In the 1930s, he owned a Stinson Reliant monoplane he named the ""Flying Printasign"" after his signmaking company. Even as he was planning to exit the pen business, he bought a used B-26 bomber. He had the armor removed and retrofitted the plane with commercial engines, christening it the “Reynolds Bombshell.” He hired war-hero Bill Odom as pilot, Tex Sallee as copilot, and in 1947 the three of them flew around the world in 78 hours, 55.5 minutes, making four stops for refueling, to set the world record for twin-engine propeller aircraft. (The previous record, set by Howard Hughes, was 91 hours, 14 minutes. Both records were surpassed in 1957.) Reynolds had timed the flight to coincide with the international introduction of the Reynolds Rocket, a pen that wrote in two colors.Reynolds and crew made one more newsworthy intercontinental flight, an expedition to the Amne Machin mountain range in Tibet and K2, the second highest mountain in the world, between China and Pakistan. He renamed his retrofitted bomber the ""China Explorer."" He believed (wrongly) that K2 was taller than Mount Everest in the Himalayas and hoped to leverage the publicity he'd get from establishing that fact.
The Chinese government detained the flight near Nanking and then sent fighter planes to escort it across the Sea of Japan. In the intervening period, Reynolds and the China Explorer had diverted their guards, taken off from Lunghwa Field, and completed a quick flyover of K2. Reynolds family lore has it that Reynolds had made a secret deal from the outset with the US government to look for evidence of Chinese nuclear tests. No one involved with the expedition admitted knowledge of such a plan. For many years thereafter, the clandestine payments passed through the Reynolds Construction Company by US intelligence were part of an operation code-named ""KK Mountain"".Reynolds sold the ""Reynolds Bombshell"" in 1948. After passing through several owners, it ended up in Iran, used by Bell Helicopter as a transport.  It was abandoned there at the time of the Iran Revolution of 1979 and remains on display there in the Aerospace Exhibition Centre, in Tehran.


== Retirement ==
Reynolds Printasign was bought out by his son James, and subsequently run by his grandson Thomas. Milton Reynolds retired to a hacienda near Mexico City, called the ""Milton Hilton."" Reynolds and investor Charles Allen speculated in land and invested in Iranian oil, and Reynolds traveled the world on commercial flights as an unofficial ""goodwill ambassador"" for the United States. Reynolds authored a book entitled ""Hasta La Vista"" in 1944, which was a story of his travels in South America. In 1944 the first edition was printed by the Greenville Publishers. An alternate ""special"" first edition (signed and issued only for his special friends) of the same book was printed in Mexico by the Chicago Packet Company and is highly prized by collectors.

Team Kiwi Racing,"Team Kiwi Racing is a racing team that previously competed in the Australian V8 Supercar series, the Australian Carrera Cup Series, The New Zealand 2.0ltr Touring Car Championship, The NZV8 Championship and BMW Championship Series. The team has since returned at much reduced scale, competing in one make series' in New Zealand while also supporting a number of up and coming young Kiwi drivers from grass root level motorsport through to domestic and international competition.
Although the majority of races in the V8 Supercar series are run in Australia, Team Kiwi Racing was the only team to be headquartered in New Zealand. Their offices are in Auckland, New Zealand while the team rented space to base their Supercar team out of workshops in both Queensland and Victoria, depending on which team they were aligning with for that coming season. When racing a Ford the team based in Victoria and when racing a Holden the team based in Queensland. For much of the second half of their V8 Supercar tenure the team formed a strategic alliances with PMM in Queensland and multi car team FPR in Melbourne in an attempt to improve on track results via multi car partnerships.
The ability of the team to operate became clouded after bankruptcy proceedings where incorrectly placed against Sole Team Owner, David John in New Zealand. The Bankruptcy proceedings were quickly annulled highlighting the news information circulating and initial bankruptcy proceedings may not have been 100% correctly applied. The annulment means David John was effectively never bankrupted but damage had been done to Mr John.Despite this and all the time and focus that goes with having to defending himself as above, Mr John and the team attended the 2009 pre-season test at Queensland Raceway in preparation for another full season in the Supercars Championship. N John's bankruptcy was later annulled in November 2009 - In 2009, after the second round in Hamilton, New Zealand; the team's REC was bought out by driver, Dean Fiore and a new team established named Triple F Racing ending TKR's involvement in V8 Supercar.


== History ==
Team Kiwi Racing is a New Zealand-based motorsport team that has achieved plenty as a team and for Kiwi drivers since their debut in 1999, both on the domestic New Zealand and International Motorsport stages. Debuting in 1999 with a two car team in the New Zealand 2.0L Touring Car championship, Team Kiwi Racing built two P11 Nissan Primera's to take on the BMW Factory backed team that had dominated the New Zealand 2.0L Touring Car Championship for many years. TKR Owner David John secured the services of Jason Richards and Angus Fogg as the selected drivers for the team and each driver was also employed as full-time staff. Richards helped with the promotions and marketing while Fogg was in charge of building the team's Nissan Primera race cars. Team Kiwi Racing announced their arrival in style on debut in the New Zealand 2.0L Touring Car Championship with the TKR Nissan Primera's taking home first position (Jason Richards) and second position (Angus Fogg) in the championship ending the dominance of the factory BMW team. Team Kiwi Racing went on to achieve back to back championship titles in 2000 with Jason Richards winning the 2.0L Touring Car Championship again for TKR while Angus Fogg came home in third place.
In 2000 Team Kiwi Racing owner David John honoured his commitment to Jason Richards and Angus Fogg and made the significant step from domestic to international competition. Debuting at Bathurst in November 2000 as the first ever New Zealand based V8 Supercar team to compete in the Australian V8 Supercar Championship, numbered #777, the car finished 16th at Bathurst, despite the race being run in driving rain. TKR used Holden vehicles as their choice of race cars until the end of the 2006 season. TKR did run a two car team at the Adelaide round and the event at Pukekohe in the 2001 V8 Supercar Championship for lead driver Jason Richards and for fellow Kiwi Angus Fogg, before deciding to focus on a single car team moving forward for Jason Richards midway through 2001.
TKR punched well above their weight as part of the Australian V8 Supercar Championship, as a privateer team that did not enjoy the benefits of factory support. TKR achieved a Pole Position at the 2004 Winton event in very trying conditions then achieved a podium in the 2005 Shanghai round, finishing third for the round. TKR finished 6th in Perth after leading the entire race from start to within 100m of the finish line where Radisich was spun around coming onto the front straight while leading. A top 8 position finish at Bathurst, 3rd in race 2 in Canberra and a number of other top ten results and not worthy drives. Throughout their existence the team only failed to qualify for an event once.
During the 2006 Bathurst 1000 endurance race at Mount Panorama, driver Paul Radisich crashed at around 200 km/h head on into a tyre barrier, flipping the car on the roof. The roof had to be cut off to get Radisich out and he was taken to hospital where he was in a serious but stable condition. The car was so badly damaged that the team was unable to race at the following Indy 300 round on the Gold Coast. The team leased the chassis from Paul Morris Motorsport used earlier in the season to replace the damaged car for the remainder of the season, with former driver Craig Baird and young NZ driver Chris Pither driving the car at the Tasmania & Bahrain rounds respectively. The car was then driven by Fujitsu V8 driver Tony Evangelou for the final round at Phillip Island.
For the 2007 season, TKR, Ford Performance Racing and Prodrive Australia entered discussions that would see TKR buy an FPR Falcon with technical support from FPR. Despite many thinking this was a factory backed deal with support from Ford NZ and Ford Australia, this was not the case. TKR was grouped with FPR due to their technical partnership, reducing TKR's available test days. Radisich was retained as the lead driver, although he missed the season opening Clipsal 500 as his recovery from the Bathurst accident continued. In May 2007 a dispute between Radisich, TKR and FPR broke out. Radisich accused TKR of breaching its contract with FPR and went out to the media with a statement saying in some way TKR had breached their contact with Radisich, despite Radisich being contracted to TKR not FPR in any manner, way, shape or form and even before TKR and FPR had officially parted ways or what plans TKR has in place.
TKR sold the ex FPR car back to FPR and contrary to what was said in the press FPR was not left out of pocket one cent. Needless to say TKR and Radisich parted company seeing Radisich out of a drive.
After missing Eastern Creek, Hidden Valley Raceway and Queensland Raceway allowing time for the preparation of a new car and engines to be completed it was announced that TKR had struck a deal with fellow Ford team Stone Brothers Racing. New Zealand Rookie Shane van Gisbergen was announced as the TKR driver to replace Radisich.
Van Gisbergen went on to prove himself as a talented young Kiwi driver with plenty of potential so much so that Stone Brothers Racing fast tracked van Gisbergen in to their team after only completing his first season with TKR.
Looking to continue with the opportunity that Team Kiwi Racing was established in the first place to provide Kiwi drivers support with establishing themselves in the Australian V8 Supercar Championship, it was announced that in 2008 Kayne Scott would drive for TKR. Scott drove eight rounds and the team rotated the car through a number of drivers such as Chris Pither, Steve Owen, Daniel Gaunt and for special promotional purposes to provide V8 Supercars additional media exposure throughout the UAE, Team Kiwi Racing provided Bahrain domestic series driver Fahad Al Musalam with the opportunity to drive the TKR V8 Supercar at the Bahrain round of the V8 Supercar Championship.
With the team struggling to get on-top of the ex888 Ford Falcon throughout the 2008 season, TKR decided that after a discussion with Paul Morris it would be better for TKR to go back to what they knew, having already purchased two PMM V8 Supercar previously.
In 2009 TKR provided the drive to former Carrera Cup racer Dean Fiore who was in a position to bring sponsors to the team and could help TKR get back on track without TKR having to fund all of the seasons running budgets as they had done for most TKR drivers over the previous years.
In 2009 around the time of the global melt down the ANZ bank in New Zealand called in a bank overdraft facility to be repaid by Team Kiwi Racing Owner David John personally. Mr John had signed as a guarantor for a $300,000 overdraft facility for Team Kiwi Racing to get the team back on track with new cars engines etc. after the 2007 Radisich crash and the 2008 Pither Bathurst crash that hurt the team close to $750,000 of repairs and replacement of car costs.
Despite Mr John explaining to ANZ bank that despite ample assets to cover the loan, that the race season had started and that he need the bank to work with him and wait till years end (7 months) as all assets he could sell off to repay the loan were required for the race team to operate such as cars, engines, trucks, transporters, V8 Supercar Franchise, merchandise etc. which were all worth well over A$3,000,000, the ANZ bank refused to wait and proceed with bankruptcy proceedings against Mr John personally. Ironically Mr John's bankruptcy was annulled with-in weeks of the bankruptcy with not one person left out of pocket or no annulment would have been provided.
Despite keeping V8 Supercars up dated on all of the above, V8 Supercars seized TKR's Racing Entitlement Contract after the Hamilton round of the Championship in order that it would be sold and or leased. Interesting the TKR franchise was sold by V8 Supercars to the very same team that Mr John had already contracted as driver for TKR in 2009 season being Dean Fiore and the same family Mr John had been in discussions with himself before V8 Supercars stepped in. The Fiore family used the franchise to start Triple F Racing.
Despite this Team Kiwi Racing has focussed on the support and development of young up and coming Kiwi drivers. In 2009 Team Kiwi Racing (TKR) secured 2 x BMW Minis to run in the New Zealand BMW Mini Challenge Championship for Matt Hamilton and Ryan Bailey. Both TKR BMW mini's dominated the BMW Mini Challenge Championship with Matthew Hamilton taking out first position and Ryan Bailey taking out second position for a TKR one two in the Championship.
As a reward Team Kiwi Racing ran Hamilton in the 2010 Fujitsu V8 Supercar Series in Australia, but only for the first three rounds.
Not content with a one two in the 2009/10 Championship TKR purchased a third BMW Mini Challenge racecar for the 2010/11 Championship season. This saw Ben, Matthew Gibson and Craig Innes selected to drive the TKR car this season. And what a season it was with the TKR not only winning back to back Championship titles but TKR also took out second and third position for a clean sweep of the podium at years end. 1st was Ben Dallas, 2nd Craig Innes and third was Matthew Gibson rounding out the TKR clean sweep.
For 2012 TKR provided Andre Heimgartner with a full season in the TKR Porsche Carrera Cup car in the Australian Porsche Carrera Cup Championship. TKR provided expert input to Heimgartner with driver advise from Porsche Carrera Cup legend Craig Baird and Porsche Technical Engineer Todd Bickerton who was contracted to TKR for the season.
Along with a number of solid results during his debut season Heimgartner was awarded Rookie of the year at the final round of the Australian Porsche Carrera Cup Championship held at the Gold Coast Indy 300 event. This saw Heimgartner provided with the opportunity to be fly over to Europe to test against other top rookies from around the world for one seat in the Porsche Super Cup Championship that is partly funded by Porsche Germany. Heimgartner missed out on the drive but again TKR had helped a young kiwi driver kick start his International motorsport career on the right foot.
During 2013 Team Kiwi Racing campaigned for a second season in the Australian Porsche Carrera Cup Championship. This time TKR Owner David John allocated the drive to Shae Davies and Adam Gowans. Both drivers were quick and achieved solid results for TKR in their respective categories highlighted by Team Kiwi Racing winning the Porsche Carrera Cup Rennsport meeting followed by three wins from three starts for TKR at Bathurst, Mount Panorama with Adam Gowans driving.
For 2014 Team Kiwi Racing purchased a NZV8 for Craig Baird to race. The season started well with Pole positions and race wins but a tough season eventuated with the older Holden engines being pushed to their limits and past them to keep up with the Ford falcon motorsport engines resulting in two engine failures that saw a tough season for TKR.
For the 2016 season Team Kiwi Racing dipped their toe in the water to experience the NZ V8SuperTourer Championship. Craig Baird again provided TKR with race wins at Pukekohe Raceway and Taupo International raceway before it was decided that the politics between NZV8 Touring cars and V8SuperTourers needed to be sorted before making further commitments to either championship going forward.
In 2017 Thomas Boniface, a 13-year-old BMW MINI Challenge Driver is the latest young Kiwi driver to be selected as part of the TKR Development Academy. Boniface is a 4 times national Kart-Sport Champion and TKR have big plans for him moving forward. Boniface finished a season high of 5th at the Taupo round out of 32 cars.
In 2019 Team Kiwi Racing decided to enter the Bathurst 1000 as a Wildcard and purchased a Triple Eight built Holden ZB Commodore and lined up 2018 Porsche Carrera Cup Australia Champion Jaxon Evans and three-time Porsche Carrera Cup Asia Champion Chris van der Drift to drive the car. The team ended up scrapping there plans due to the lack of funding.

August Vollmer,"August Vollmer (March 7, 1876 – November 4, 1955) was the first police chief of Berkeley, California, and a leading figure in the development of the field of criminal justice in the United States in the early 20th century. He has been described as ""the father of modern policing"". Vollmer played an influential role in introducing early 20th-century police reforms, which increasingly militarized police departments in the United States. A veteran of the Spanish–American War in the Philippines and the Philippine–American War, Vollmer introduced reforms that reflected his experiences in the U.S. military.


== Early life ==
Vollmer was born in New Orleans to German immigrant parents, John and Philopine (Klundt) Vollmer. His father saw to it that he learned to box and swim, both of which he excelled at. Upon his father's death, his mother returned to Germany with her children for two years, after which she returned to New Orleans in 1886, but soon thereafter decided to move her family to San Francisco. In July 1890, the Vollmer family moved across the bay to Berkeley.
Before he was 20, August helped organize the North Berkeley Volunteer Fire Department, and in 1897, was awarded the Berkeley Fireman medal. He supported his mother and the rest of his family as a partner in Patterson and Vollmer, a hay, grain, wood and coal supply store, at the corner of Shattuck Avenue and Vine Street near a fire station north of downtown Berkeley.
In 1898, August enlisted in the Eighth Corps of the United States Army, fighting in numerous engagements in the Spanish–American War in the Philippines as well as taking part in occupation duties following the close of formal combat. Vollmer left the military in August 1899 and returned to Berkeley. In March 1900, he began working for the local post office.


== Law enforcement ==
In 1904, Vollmer became a local hero when he leapt onto a runaway railroad freight car on Shattuck Avenue in downtown Berkeley and applied its brakes, preventing a disastrous collision with a loaded passenger coach at the Berkeley station. This event led to his election as town marshal on April 10, 1905.
In 1907, Vollmer was re-elected town marshal.  He was also elected president of the California Association of Police Chiefs, even though, by title, he was not yet a police chief himself.  In 1909, Berkeley created the office of police chief, and Vollmer became the first to hold that office.
Drawing on his military experience, and his own research, Vollmer reorganized the Berkeley police force.  Vollmer had discovered that very little literature existed in the United States on the subject of police work, so he located and read a number of European works on the subject, in particular, Criminal Psychology, by Hans Gross, an Austrian criminologist, and Memoirs of Vidocq, by Eugène François Vidocq, head of the detective division of the French police in Paris.  He then set out on a program of modernization.  He established a bicycle patrol and created the first centralized police records system, designed to streamline and organize criminal investigations.  He established a call box network.  And he trained his deputies in marksmanship.
In the ensuing years, Vollmer's reputation as the ""father of modern law enforcement"" grew. He was the first chief to require that police officers attain college degrees, and persuaded the University of California to teach criminal justice.  In 1916, UC Berkeley established a criminal justice program, headed by Vollmer. At Berkeley, he taught O. W. Wilson, who went on to become a professor and continued efforts to professionalize policing, by being the first to establish the first police science degree at Municipal University of Wichita (now Wichita State University).  This is often seen as the start of criminal justice as an academic field.
Vollmer's courses taught how there were ""racial types"", and how ""heredity"" and ""racial degeneration"" contributed to crime.Vollmer was also the first police chief to create a motorized force, placing officers on motorcycles and in cars so that they could patrol a broader area with greater efficiency.  Radios were included in patrol cars.  He was also the first to use the lie detector, developed at the University of California, in police work.  Vollmer supported programs to assist disadvantaged children, and was often criticized for his leniency towards petty offenders such as drunks and loiterers. He also encouraged the employment and training of African American (first hired in 1919) and female (first hired in 1925) police officers. This included the hiring of Walter A. Gordon, who became the recipient of the Benjamin Ide Wheeler Medal in 1955.In 1921, Vollmer was elected president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police. Vollmer left the Berkeley Police Department for a brief stint as police chief of the Los Angeles Police Department from 1923 to 1924, but returned upon being disillusioned by the extent of corruption and hostility towards leadership coming from outside the department. Nonetheless, Vollmer introduced militaristic reforms to the LAPD.Vollmer married Millicent Gardner in 1924.  They had no children. In 1926, Vollmer played himself in the silent serial Officer 444 which was filmed in Berkeley under the direction of John Ford's brother Francis Ford.

Vollmer contributed to sections of the Wickersham Commission national criminal justice report of 1931, namely to the fourteenth and final volume, The Police, which advocated for a well-selected, well-educated, and well-funded professionalized police force.  Other portions of the Wickersham report were sharply critical of current police practice; one of the volumes was entitled Lawlessness in Law Enforcement. Vollmer was the 1931 recipient of the Benjamin Ide Wheeler Medal.He retired from the Berkeley Police in 1932 as his eyesight began to fail.  He was then appointed as a professor of police administration in the Political Science Department at the University of California, and went on to found its School of Criminology.  He was also among the five people elected as the first directors of the East Bay Regional Parks District in 1934. The same year Vollmer was awarded the Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences. In 1941, he was instrumental in the establishment of what would become the American Society of Criminology, the leading professional criminological association in the world.


== Drug prohibition ==
Vollmer was against police involvement with the problem of drug addiction, which he viewed as a medical and regulatory issue rather than a criminal one: ""Like prostitution, and like liquor, drug use was not a police problem; it never has been and never can be solved by policemen."" Vollmer wrote that enforcement of moralistic vice laws leads to police corruption and ""engenders disrespect both for law and for the agents of law enforcement."" Vollmer supported the establishment of federal distribution, at cost, of habit-forming drugs. Vollmer's views, however, found little favor in the prohibitionist-dominated consensus of the time.


== Later life and death ==
Late in life, Vollmer developed Parkinson's disease and cancer. On the morning of November 4, 1955, he told his housekeeper, ""I'm going to shoot myself. Call the Berkeley Police"", then stepped outside and did so.


== Tributes ==
Bald Peak in the hills above Berkeley was renamed Vollmer Peak in 1940.
In 2004 the Alameda County Sheriff's Office christened a new 32-foot custom patrol boat the August Vollmer.
In 1959 the American Society of Criminology established the August Vollmer Award to recognize an individual whose scholarship or professional activities have made outstanding contributions to justice or to the treatment or prevention of criminal or delinquent behavior.
In the Nero Wolfe detective stories created by Rex Stout, Wolfe's doctor, who frequently helps him with his cases, is Dr. Vollmer.

Seminary Ridge,"Seminary Ridge is a dendritic ridge that served as an area of military engagements during the Battle of Gettysburg, the bloodiest battle of the American Civil War, which was fought between July 1 and July 3, 1863 in and around Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Seminary Ridge also served as a military installation during World War II.


== Geography ==
Seminary Ridge is a northern portion of the drainage divide between the Marsh Creek Watershed on the west and the Rock Creek Watershed on the east.  At the south end of Oak Ridge, the northernmost portion of the divide, the north-south McPherson and Seminary ridges bifurcate southward: 44  at the triple watershed point of Willoughby's and Pitzer runs southward tributaries of Marsh Creek with a Rock Creek eastward tributary. From the triple point, Seminary Ridge extends southward to an area with eastward drainage into Stevens Creek, with the borough of Gettysburg. 
Farther south into the Gettysburg National Park, Seminary Ridge continues as far as a branch of Pitzer Run, which divides the ridgeline (39.808173°N 77.255516°W﻿ / 39.808173; -77.255516), around which the drainage divide curves to the east.  The ridgeline continues south of the branch, crossing the Millerstown Road.  Between the Millerstown and Emmitsburg road crossings, the west side of the ridgeline is an elevated area (hornfel along the northwest edge of a diabase sheet) about 1 mile wide along the Emmitsburg Road. Along this east side of this elevated area, the ridgeline is Warfield Ridge, the southernmost portion of Seminary Ridge near the south end of the Gettysburg Battlefield. South of the tip of Seminary and Warfield Ridge tip, the Marsh and Rock creeks' drainage divide continues about four miles to near the Mason–Dixon line at their confluence to form Monocacy River.
The portion of Seminary Ridge on the western side of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania includes the railroad cut behind houses north of Buford Avenue and the historic Gettysburg Armory.  Extending south are Schultz Woods, Spangler Woods, Berdan Woods, the McMillan Woods Youth Campground, Pitzer Woods, Biesecker's Woods, and the 1895 Longstreet Tower, which provides an observation platform for the ""southern end"" of Seminary Ridge (Warfield Ridge).  Eisenhower National Historic Site, located on the west of the ridge, is visible from the tower.
Seminary Ridge Avenue and the sections of West Confederate Avenue to the northwest and southwest extend along the landform's ridgeline and provide access to numerous battle monuments on the ridge, including the prominent monument to Frederick William Sievers, known as the Virginia monument. Seminary Ridge is crossed by Buford and Springs Avenues and West Middle Street.


=== South Seminary Ridge ===
South Seminary Ridge is a Gettysburg Battlefield landform south of an east-west branch of Pitzer Run, which separates South Seminary Ridge from a separate landform to the north on the west of Gettysburg with the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg.  South of the Pitzer Run branch, the ridgeline of South Seminary Ridge extends from Pitzer Woods, across the Millerstown Road, past the Longstreet Tower to the Emmitsburg Road and on to the southernmost state memorial on the battlefield (Alabama), which is just west of the right flank marker for the Confederate Line.  
Warfield Ridge is a portion of South Seminary Ridge southward to the Alabama Memorial, and the ridge landform continues southward out of the Gettysburg National Park to where Ridge Road is on the crest.


== History ==
In 1761, Samuel Gettys tavern was built near the ridge at the crossroads] east of Stevens Creek, and it preceded both the c. 1812 construction of the Chambersburg Pike across the ridge and the nearby ""Gettysburg Theological Seminary"" being established on the ridge on August 1, 1826.In 1832, Old Dorm, now Schmucker Hall, was built, and Pennsylvania College (now Gettysburg College) was started on the east side of the ridge.  On the ridge along the Chambersburg Pike, the Thaddeus Stevens building near the seminary (used for Robert E. Lee's 1863 headquarters) was built in 1834.  At the time of the battle, the section of the ridge at the extension of West Middle St (the Hagerstown Rd) was known as ""Haupt's Hill"".


=== Civil War and postbellum ===

Seminary Ridge was the site of Battle of Gettysburg fighting on July 1, 1863, and the Pitzer Woods engagement on July 2.  Robert E. Lee established his headquarters on the ridge just north of the Chambersburg pike, and the ridge also served as the Confederate line of battle for July 2 and 3 attacks against Union Army positions on Cemetery Ridge. On July 3, 500 men in George Pickett's division were killed or wounded on Seminary Ridge, including 88 lost in one regiment of Kemper's Brigade from the Federal artillery counterfire prior to Pickett's Charge.: 134–6   The last hospital patient of the seminary's Old Dorm left on September 16, 1863.Longstreet Tower (No. 2 of five at Gettysburg) was built on the ridge by the War Department in 1895.  West Confederate Avenue was built at the turn of the 20th century for Seminary Ridge tourism, while Sharpshooters Avenue (named Berdan Avenue by 1930) was extended from W Confederate Avenue in 1917 for access to a Pitzer Woods monument.  In 1918, various military camp sites (e.g., Camp Colt) were located in the ""Field of Pickett's Charge"" between the Seminary and Cemetery ridges.  The North Carolina Monument was placed on the ridge in 1929.
The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) built the 1938 Civil War veteran's camp for the 75th Anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg and performed Gettysburg Battlefield landscaping through 1941.  Construction had begun c. November 1933: g  for Gettysburg CCC camp ""NP-2"", which opened May 26, 1934 on Seminary Ridge and closed in 1941.  Renamed from ""MP-2"", camp NP-2 was in McMillan Woods, while a different CCC camp was in Pitzer Woods: a  (""MP-1""/""NP-1"") from 1935 until closing in April 1937.  The Pitzer's Woods camp was for reforestation and a 1933 ""cyclone"" blew all 45 tents down (200 trees were downed at the Round Tops).: a   The ""Gettysburg Company 1355, C.C.C."" celebrated their 8th anniversary in 1941.: a 


=== World War II and post-war ===
During 1943-4, Camp Sharpe at the former Pitzer Woods CCC camp NP-1 trained soldiers for psychological operations in the European Theater of Operations, and adjacent to Camp Sharpe was a 1944-6 POW camp at CCC camp NP-2 in McMillan Woods.  Following the 1950 purchase of the Eisenhower farm, the US Secret Service monitored the tourists using the top of the nearby Longstreet Tower, and the Pitzer Woods amphitheater was constructed in the 1960s  The Adams County Historical Society moved to the seminary's Old Dorm on the ridge in 1961, and the National Register of Historic Places added Old Dorm in 1974 (the Gettysburg Armory in 1990).In 1982, the Tennessee State Memorial on West Confederate Avenue was the last confederate state memorial to be dedicated, and the memorial to James Longstreet was erected in Pitzer Woods in 1998 after being planned in 1941.  The ridge's Historic Preservation Foundation at 61 Seminary Ridge Av was formed on April 29, 1999.

Arginine decarboxylase,"The enzyme Acid-Induced Arginine Decarboxylase (AdiA)  (EC 4.1.1.19), also commonly referred to as arginine decarboxylase,  catalyzes the conversion of L-arginine into agmatine and carbon dioxide. The process consumes a proton in the decarboxylation and employs a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) cofactor, similar to other enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism, such as ornithine decarboxylase and glutamine decarboxylase. It is found in bacteria and virus, though most research has so far focused on forms of the enzyme in bacteria. During the AdiA catalyzed decarboxylation of arginine, the necessary proton is consumed from the cell cytoplasm which helps to prevent the over-accumulation of protons inside the cell and serves to increase the intracellular pH. Arginine decarboxylase is part of an enzymatic system in Escherichia coli (E. coli), Salmonella Typhimurium, and methane-producing bacteria Methanococcus jannaschii that makes these organisms acid resistant and allows them to survive under highly acidic medium.


== Structure ==
Arginine decarboxylase is a multimer of protein subunits. For instance, the form of this enzyme in E. coli is a ca. 800 kDa decamer of identical subunits, and is composed as a pentamer of dimers. Each subunit can be divided into five domains: (1) the amino-terminal wing domain, (2) the linker domain, (3) the PLP-binding domain, (4) the aspartate aminotransferase- (AspAT-) like small domain, and (5) the carboxy-terminal domain. The AspAT-like small domain, the PLP-binding domain, and the carboxy-terminal domain form an open bowl-like structure. The wing domain extends from the other three domains like a handle of the bowl, and the linker domain connects these two parts together. Altogether, the five domains associate with one another through hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions.
In E. coli arginine decarboxylase, each homodimer has two active sites that are buried about 30 Å from the dimer surface. The active site, found in the PLP-binding domain, consists of the PLP cofactor bound to a lysine residue in the form of a Schiff base. The phosphate group of PLP is held in place through hydrogen bonding with the alcoholic side chains of several serine and threonine residues, as well as through hydrogen bonding with the imidazole side chain of a histidine residue. The protonated nitrogen on the PLP aromatic ring is hydrogen bonded to a carboxylate on an aspartic side chain.


== Mechanism ==
The mechanism of arginine decarboxylase is analogous to other deaminating and decarboxylating PLP enzymes in its use of a Schiff base intermediate. Initially, Lys386 residue is displaced in a transamination reaction by the L-arginine substate, forming an arginine Schiff base with the PLP cofactor. Decarboxylation of arginine carboxylate group then occurs, where it is hypothesized that the C-C bond broken is perpendicular to the PLP pyridine ring. The pyridine nitrogen group acts as an electron-withdrawing group that facilitates the C-C bond breaking. Protonation of the amino acid leads to the formation of a new Schiff base that subsequently undergoes a transamination reaction by the lysine reside of arginine decarboxylase, regenerating the catalytically active PLP and releasing agmantine as a product.  Though it has been hypothesized that a protonated histidine residue involves in the protonation step as a proton source, the identity of the proton-donating residue in arginine decarboxylase has yet to be confirmed.


== Function ==
Arginine decarboxylase is one of the main components of arginine-dependent acid resistance (AR3) that allows E. coli to survive long enough in the highly acidic environment of the stomach to pass through the digestive tract and infect a human host. The enzyme consumes a cytoplasmic proton in the decarboxylation reaction, preventing the pH of the cell from becoming too acidic. The activity of the enzyme is dependent upon the surrounding pH. At more basic cellular pH levels, the enzyme exists in an inactive homodimer form, as electrostatic repulsion between negatively-charged acidic residues in the wing domains prevent homodimers from assembling into the catalytically active decamer. As the cellular environment becomes more acidic, these residues become neutrally charged through protonation. With less electrostatic repulsion between homodimers, the enzyme is allowed to assemble as the catalytically active decamer. This particular assembling strategy used by E. coli arginine decarboxylase is also commonly used by other acidophilic organisms to cope with acidic growth conditions. Overall, the acid resistance activity of arginine decarboxylase is two-fold. The surface protein residues of the homodimer consume protons, leading to the formation of active decamers which further increase proton consumption via the decarboxylation reaction. Arginine decarboxylase works in tandem with arginine decarboxylase antiporters (AdiC), another component of AR3, that exchange the extracellular arginine substrate for the intracellular by-product of decarboxylation.

Numerical tower,"In Scheme and in Lisp dialects inspired by it, the numerical tower is a set of data types that represent numbers and a logic for their hierarchical organisation.

Each type in the tower conceptually ""sits on"" a more fundamental type, so an integer is a rational number and a number, but the converse is not necessarily true, i.e. not every number is an integer. This asymmetry implies that a language can safely allow implicit coercions of numerical types—without creating semantic problems—in only one direction: coercing an integer to a rational loses no information and will never influence the value returned by a function, but to coerce most reals to an integer would alter any relevant computation (e.g., the real 1/3 does not equal any integer) and is thus impermissible.


== In Lisp ==
Principally, the numerical tower is designed to codify the set theoretic properties of numbers in an easy-to-implement language facility: every integer is a rational with an implicit denominator of 1, and all reals are complex with an implicit imaginary part of 0. Practically, the implementation may save time and space by ignoring these properties unless they become arithmetically relevant, and also may correspondingly improve the efficiency of its representation when reducing numerical values to their canonical representation by eliminating negligible components of a number.
The most generic type, number, is somewhat confusingly named: it exists to capture all mathematical values whose type is more general than complex, but which are still usable with standard mathematical operations, as defined by Scheme. Thus it captures, for example, positive and negative infinity (+inf.0 and -inf.0, the significand here meaning approximation up to cardinality), since those are mathematical objects to which at least some numerical operations may validly apply (e.g. one can add to or multiply by infinity, yielding infinity; or compare cardinality against infinity, with infinity always being greater than any finite value). On a more technical level, number in Lisp simply provides a place in the type hierarchy for the kinds of non-strictly-numerical values defined by IEEE 754.
The Scheme programming language defines all its arithmetic within this model, as do most other Lisp dialects. Some implementations may extend or adapt the tower. Kawa, a Scheme implementation for the JVM, extends the tower to include both quaternions and quantities, with quantities being a way of subtyping numerical values with units; e.g. a number of grams cannot meaningfully be added to a number of metres because via quantities numbers inherit logic derived from dimensional analysis to govern their meaning in relation to and thus valid arithmetical interactions with each other.
Another common variation is to support both exact and inexact versions of the tower or parts of it; R7RS Scheme recommends but does not strictly require this of implementations. In this case, similar semantics are used to determine the permissibility of implicit coercion: inexactness is a contagious property of numbers, and any numerical operation involving both exact and inexact values must yield inexact return values of at least the same precision as the most precise inexact number appearing in the expression, unless the precision is practically infinite (e.g. containing a detectable repetend), or unless it can be proven that the precision of the result of the operation is independent of the inexactness of any of its operands (for example, a series of multiplications where at least one multiplicand is 0).


== In other languages ==
Most programming languages and language implementations do not support a Scheme-like numerical tower, though some languages provide limited or inconsistent support if implementation simplicity permits. Python, for example, provides a similar structure via PEP3141, citing Scheme's example, though in practice rational numbers (fractions) must be imported from their own module, and both rational and complex numbers use slightly variant syntax from normal number literals, since Python's syntax is less explicit than Lisp's.
Thus in the following Scheme examples we see:

While in the following Python examples we see:

In the Python examples, we can see that numerical issues freely arise with an inconsistent application of the semantics of its type coercion. While 1 / 3 in Python is treated as a call to divide 1 by 3, yielding a float, the inclusion of rationals inside a complex number, though clearly permissible, implicitly coerces them from rationals into floats or ints, even in cases where this is incorrect.
Smalltalk is another programming language that follows this model, but it has ArithmeticValue and Magnitude as superclasses of Number.

His  father's second in command, Christopher Dufrost de La Jemeraye and Jean Baptiste led a smaller advance party west to Rainy Lake and established a fort they named Fort St. Pierre (after the parish church where Jean Baptiste was baptised).The following year Jean Baptiste was instrumental in founding Fort St. Charles on Lake of the Woods and in 1734 he established Fort Maurepas on the Red River.On June 6, 1736, Sioux Indians ambushed a party led by Jean Baptiste soon after they left Fort St. Charles on Lake of the Woods. They were headed for Fort Kaministiquia to fetch provisions. Jean Baptiste, Father Jean-Pierre Aulneau and 19 other men were massacred. Their bodies were later transported to Fort Saint-Charles and buried in the chapel.Jean-Baptiste de La Vérendrye's share in the construction of Fort Maurepas makes him one of the founders of the present province of Manitoba.

Murders of Neta Sorek and Kristine Luken,"Kristine Luken was an American Christian who was murdered in a Palestinian terrorist attack on December 18, 2010, while hiking with her friend Kay Wilson in the hills of Jerusalem. Despite multiple stab wounds, Wilson survived the attack; Luken's body was later found by Israeli police, bound and stabbed to death. The Palestinian terror cell that perpetrated the attack were later arrested. During the investigation, the cell members also confessed to the murder of Neta Sorek, whose stabbed body had been found earlier that year near the Beit Jimal Monastery in the Judean Hills. The Palestinian terrorists were convicted of a series of violent crimes.


== Murder of Neta Sorek ==


=== Background ===
Neta Sorek (Hebrew: נטע שורק), aged 53, grew up in Israel at Kibbutz Afikim. She later moved to Sweden and then to the United States, but after two decades abroad, she returned to Israel, married and had a daughter. She had worked as an English–language teacher in Zikhron Ya'akov for 13 years and was a member of the feminist group Women for Peace, participating in joint Arab-Jewish projects. Her family said she believed in co-existence; she studied Arabic and met with Arab women from villages in northern Israel. In love with nature, she regularly walked outdoors.On the day of the attack Sorek was on a vacation in small guest house located near the Beit Jimal Monastery. Shortly after she reached the site she headed out for a walk around the monastery, where she was murdered.

On 24 February 2010, members of a Palestinian terrorist cell illegally infiltrated into Israel from Surif, a Palestinian Authority-controlled area, through gaps in the security barrier near Betar Illit. They burgled a house and stole a car from Beit Shemesh and then drove to the Beit Jimal Monastery, waiting for nightfall to make their return to Surif. At the monastery, they spotted Sorek walking alone in the monastery gardens and decided to murder her. They stabbed her to death and fled the vicinity in their stolen car.
Sorek's family were informed several hours later that she had not returned to the place where she was staying. The police were alerted and the Beit Shemesh police station began to investigate her disappearance. Dissatisfied with the police efforts, her family began to search for Neta by themselves. They knew that she had visited the monastery and approximated her whereabouts; eventually, her cousin and two friends discovered her body. Initially the police suspected a suicide but, after an autopsy was conducted, results showed her death was caused as a result of foul play. An investigation was launched to find Neta's murderers.


== Murder of Kristine Luken ==


=== Background ===
Luken, aged 44, was an American citizen and a member of the Church's Ministry among Jewish people (CMJ), a Christian group based in the United States and the UK. She was born in Texas and lived for many years in Virginia while working for the US Department of Education before leaving to work for CMJ. She had recently moved to Nottingham, England, where she worked as a ministry staffer. She had first visited Israel in 2007 as part of a Christian pilgrimage to holy sites and she described the tour as furthering her religious understanding and deepening her relationship with God. Luken met Kay Wilson, a British-born Israeli citizen, in August 2010 on a trip to Poland where Wilson was guiding. They visited death camps and Jewish community centers. They became friends and Luken, a keen hiker, and Wilson, a professional Israeli tour guide, decided to go hiking together in Israel during the Christmas holiday.


=== Attack ===
On Saturday afternoon, 18 December 2010, Luken and Wilson were hiking in the Mata forest, near the town of Beit Shemesh, west of Jerusalem. They noticed two Arab men, Aiad Fatfata and Kifah Ghanimat, approaching them and were suspicious of their intentions. The men attacked them armed with a long serrated knife. The women attempted to fight back, Wilson managing to stab an attacker with a pocketknife, before they were subdued. The men stole their money and removed Wilson's necklace. Wilson recalled: ""I didn't understand whether they wanted to rape us or mug us. They removed my Star of David. I tried to convince them we weren't Jewish.""
Wilson instructed Luken to feign an epileptic attack and told their assailants that they were part of a tour group that would soon be returning. After half an hour at being held at knife point, their shoes were removed and their hands tied behind their backs. After being gagged with parts of a fleece jacket, the two women were separated and forced to kneel on hands and knees. The two women begged for their lives to be spared but were then stabbed multiple times. Wilson later told police: ""I realized he was going to behead me. I saw Kristine murdered before my eyes. She was yelling. I didn't want it to hurt me. I tried to keep silent. It was tough, because the beatings were hard, but I tried to play dead.""
Wilson was stabbed 13 times and sustained several broken ribs, punctured lungs and diaphragm, a dislocated shoulder, a broken shoulder blade, and a broken sternum; Luken was fatally stabbed in the attack. The attackers returned a few minutes later to confirm that the two women were dead. Wilson was stabbed again in the chest. She said: ""I played dead. I saw [the knife] hadn't gone into my heart. My friend was dying, I heard her making gurgling sounds."" Wilson regained consciousness and found herself between bushes in the forest. Feeling weak and severely injured, she tried to shift herself to the forest trail so that other people might discover her. She recounted: ""I just wanted to sleep and felt as though I were about to collapse, but I knew I could not fall asleep. I tried to get up three times and fell down, I deviated from the path and couldn't find my way, and it was very difficult for me to breathe, but I had to make a switch in my head and think positive.""
With her hands still bound behind her back, Wilson staggered barefoot and bleeding heavily from multiple stab wounds for more than 1,200 meters until reaching a parking lot where a family alerted the authorities. She was hospitalized in the Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital in a critical condition. Due to Wilson stabbing one of the attackers with a small penknife, the DNA on her knife led to the capture of a terror cell. She was declared a heroine by the Israeli Shin Bet and the Israeli press.Police and border officials organized a large hunt for Luken, combing the forests around Beit Shemesh. After an overnight search, Luken's body was found ensconced in bushes, bound and stabbed to death. Police believed her body had been moved there by the assailants.


== Aftermath ==
The role of the Israeli West Bank barrier in preventing terrorist attacks was analyzed and Haaretz concluded that while the West Bank barrier remained unfinished, terrorists continued to have easy access into Israel through the Beit Shemesh corridor from the West Bank.


=== Memorial service ===
A memorial service for Kristine Luken was held at the Christ Church in the Old City in Jerusalem, with around 100 people attending. Her family said that ""she went boldly where she believe God wanted her to go"" and was not deterred by the ""questioning and ridicule from others."" CMJ director, Robin Aldridge, praised her dedication and said she ""radiated goodness that came from the inner core of her being."" A memorial service was later held in Nottingham, England. Luken's body was flown back to the United States for burial.


=== Arrests ===
A month after the attack, Israeli police arrested members of the Palestinian terror cell responsible for the murder of Luken and the attempted murder of Wilson. The police relied upon Wilson's testimony, and DNA samples were produced from the blood stains of Ayad Fasafa, who had been lightly stabbed by Wilson in the attack. Ayad Fasafa and Kifah Ghanimat were linked to the scene and confessed to the crime. Police discovered that Kifah Ghanimat was the leader of a Palestinian terror cell of four members, all residents of the Hebron region, that included Ayad Fasafa and Ibrahim Ghanimat.
In addition to admitting to Luken's murder, members of the terror cell confessed to the murder of Neta Sorek from earlier that year and said that they had perpetrated additional stabbing and shooting attacks. The men declared their goal of murdering Jews. The Palestinian cell were indicted for two murders, two attempted murders, a rape and a series of other violent crimes.


=== Trial ===
The Jerusalem District Court convicted Kifah Ghanimat of the murder of Luken and sentenced him to two life sentences and 60 years behind bars. He was convicted under a plea bargain, under which he admitted to the murder of Luken and another attempted murder charge was dropped and two clauses amended. He was also convicted of unlawful entry into Israel, stealing weapons, weapons trading and four counts of attempted murder. Kifah Ghanimat was also convicted of one count of aggravated rape from July 2009. After tying the victim's hands, Kifah had raped her at knifepoint in a cave near the Beit Jamal monastery.The judges said that Kifah Ghanimat: ""...was just evil for the sake of being evil, cruel and apathetic to his fellowman, as he stabbed two helpless women to death and slaughtered others with a large knife, and doing such things for months. The cries of the victims echo not only in our imagination but are also heard in the family members' immense suffering."" Ayad Fatafta was convicted of a number of offenses including the murder of Luken and the attempted murder of Wilson.For the murder of Neta Sorek, Kifah's brother, Ibrahim Ghanimat, received a life sentence and 16 additional years in prison and was also convicted on further charges including car theft and unlawful entry into Israel.


=== Responses ===
Kay Wilson is now an international writer and speaker. She speaks for the Israeli advocacy agency Stand With Us and for One Family Together, an Israeli NGO that helps Israeli victims of Palestinian terrorism. She has since grown attached to Orthodox Judaism, saying ""It was interesting how I evolved religiously after the attack. I had always seen myself as an Israeli more than a Jew. After the attack, I became convinced I was attacked because I was a Jew, and consequently I began to identify more with Judaism"". She has since began to practice the Jewish customs of lighting Shabbat candles and keeping kosher.Kay Wilson helped found and grow the organization Yellow Brick Road, whose purpose is ""to promote the concepts of personal, social and environmental responsibility"" in an after-school program in Palestinian refugee camps.
In an interview in 2020, Wilson explained, ""By me owning, directing and limiting my rage towards only the guilty and not blaming everyone, I have become friends with many Arabs, Muslims and Palestinians. Ironically, it was people from these communities who reached out to me, thanking me for not blaming them and even asking what they can do to help.""


=== U.S. criminal complaint ===
In April 2017, U.S. prosecutors filed a criminal complaint against Fatafta and Ghanimat at the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, charging them with murdering a U.S. national outside the United States.

J. C. P. Williams,"John Cyprian Phipps Williams (born 16 November 1922) is a New Zealand cardiologist known for discovering what is now called Williams syndrome in 1961.


== Education and early career ==
Born in Wellington, New Zealand, Williams graduated with a Bachelor of Science from Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand in 1945 and a Bachelor of Arts from the same institution in 1947. He studied medicine at the Otago Medical School in Dunedin and graduated in 1953.From 1954 to 1955 he worked as house surgeon at the Auckland Hospital, and after a period at the Thames Hospital, he worked from 1956 to 1962 at the Auckland Hospital and Green Lane Hospital. It was during this period, while working as registrar that in 1961 he published his paper on the syndrome that was to bear his name. He had noted a grouping of young patients who were short in stature, had elfin facial features, had cardiac problems, were very friendly and had cognitive deficits. He was appointed a consultant in cardiology at Green Lane Hospital in 1963.Williams had a reputation for being erratic and eccentric, and his life has been subject to various claims and conspiracy theories. Despite suggestions that Williams had disappeared while on his way to take up a position at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, from October 1962 to September 1965 he worked there as postdoctoral fellow in the cardiovascular physiology laboratory with the physiologist Earl Wood. His colleagues there later described him a private person with some odd behaviours. None recalled his mentioning Williams syndrome and he did not continue research in the area. After the end of his fellowship, Williams worked as a consultant with Wood until September 1966. He continued to be associated with the Mayo Clinic after he moved to the United Kingdom where he worked with the physiologist Andrew Huxley at University College, London from October 1966 to October 1968.


== Later life and disappearance ==
Williams was a man of many interests, including music and literature. In 1967 and while in London, he met the New Zealander poet Janet Frame, who was a friend of a friend. Shortly afterwards Frame became ill with viral meningitis, and after a hospitalisation, she accepted an invitation to stay with Williams as she recovered. They developed some intimacy and she later wrote that she ""enjoyed his company immensely, and admired him greatly...[He] gets top marks from me for ‘livability-with.’” On a subsequent visit to the United Kingdom in 1969, Frame stayed with Williams again, using his flat as a base in London. During her visit, Williams proposed marriage to Frame, asking, ""Why don't we formalize our relationship?"" Frame fled, not expecting or wanting marriage. When she returned to London about a week later, Williams had disappeared, and little is known of his later movements.Friends and colleagues met Williams in Europe, with the last meetings occurring in the mid 1970s in Salzburg, Austria. In 1972, he accepted and then later declined a post at the Latter Day Saints Hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States. Williams renewed his passport in Geneva in September 1979. At the behest of his sister, Interpol tried and failed to find him and in 1988 Williams was declared ""a missing person presumed to be dead from 1978"" by the High Court of New Zealand. However, author Michael King reports that Williams contacted him indirectly in January 2000, asking that he not be ""discussed"" in King's biography of Janet Frame.

Tom Butler-Bowdon,"Tom Butler-Bowdon (; born 1967) is a non-fiction author based in Oxford, England.


== Early life ==
Butler-Bowdon was born in Adelaide. He graduated from the University of Sydney (BA Hons, Government and History) and the London School of Economics (MSc Politics of the World Economy).


== Career ==
Butler-Bowdon is most notable for the 50 Classics series of books, which provide commentaries on key writings in personal development, psychology, philosophy and economics.
The series is published in English by Nicholas Brealey Publishing, and has been translated into 23 languages.
Referring to his earlier work on the personal development literature, Butler-Bowdon was described by USA Today as ""a true scholar of this type of literature"". His 50 Self-Help Classics won the 2004 Benjamin Franklin Award (US) for the Psychology/Self-Help category.Butler-Bowdon's ""50 Economics Classics: The Greatest Books Distilled"" was awarded a silver medal in the 2018 Axiom Business Book Awards, in the Business Reference category.In a 2016 interview, Butler-Bowdon described the thinking behind his 50 Classics books:
""I feel my job is to mine the often transformative information in books and bring it to a bigger audience. Most people only have the time to read a few books a year, but just a single important insight could put them on the path to something great. What drives me is the idea that at some point in the future, the average person will possess much more knowledge than what is acceptable now. The possession of knowledge on its own doesn't automatically translate into success, but what it does do is provide more references against which to check new information. For instance, it is easy to get swayed by some new idea or movement on social media or television, but if you have some grounding in history or economics, you will be able to say, ""This idea has come around before, and it didn't work"". What has been shown to work is x, y or z.""Bruce Rosenstein described Butler-Bowdon as ""a curator extraordinaire, and unerringly determines the appropriate books to cover, which is far from an easy task."".Butler-Bowdon is also Series Editor for the Capstone Classics series published by Wiley & Sons (Europe). Within this series he has provided critical introductions to Think and Grow Rich, The Science of Getting Rich, Sun Tzu's Art of War, Machiavelli's The Prince, Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching, Plato's The Republic, Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet, and Florence Scovel Shinn's The Game of Life.
He is the author of a motivational work, Think Long: Why It's Never Too Late To Be Great, Virgin, published April 2012.

Dip dye,"Dip dye (also known as tip dyeing) is a hair coloring style that involves dipping the ends of the hair into dye. The dye used can be naturally or brightly colored, the latter being the more popular choice. The method has become increasingly popular as a result of social media and use by celebrities. Dip dye originates from the process of tie dyeing clothing (especially T-shirts).
Dip-dyeing and the ombré hairstyle are similar. However, dip dyeing usually involves brighter neon colors and a less smooth gradient in color than an ombre style, which is typically a more blended and natural coloration. Another similar hair coloring technique that is confusing is balayage because it is so similar to Ombré, but looks like ""growing-out"" highlights.


== Trends ==
Dip dye hair is one of the biggest trends of the decade with hairstyles. Many celebrities have been seen with this idea of color fading in the hair. Celebrities like Lea Michele and Vanessa Hudgens have represented this trend. Dip dye is similar to the ombre and balayage styles that have a color fade in the hair. These are all ways to color hair without using the highlighting or dyeing processes that use foils. They tend to have more natural looking styles than the highlighting processes.


== Evolution ==
Dip dye began with a more extreme look that added neon colors to the end of the hair. Later people began to transition to colors that have a more natural look. For blondes, many recommend going up to four shades lighter than your natural color. Brunettes and darker hair colors have more of a variety of options to explore such as copper or red.

Louis XIV Victory Monument,"The Louis XIV Victory Monument was an elaborate trophy memorial celebrating the military and domestic successes of the early decades of Louis XIV's personal rule, primarily those during the Franco-Dutch War of 1672–1678, on the Place des Victoires (Victories' Square) in central Paris. It was designed and sculpted by Martin Desjardins between 1682 and 1686 on a commission by François d'Aubusson, Duke of La Feuillade. The monument's centerpiece, a colossal statue of Louis XIV crowned by an allegory of victory, was destroyed in 1792 during the French Revolution. Significant other parts of the monument have been preserved and are now mostly kept at the Louvre. 
Together with the two triumphal arches, the Porte Saint-Denis (1672) and Porte Saint-Martin (1674), and echoing the Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles (decorated 1680–1684), the Victory Monument marked the high point of public exaltation of Louis XIV's military glory and European dominance in the urban landscape of Paris, before the setbacks and exhaustion that would come later in his reign with the Nine Years' War and War of the Spanish Succession.


== Background ==
Prominent courtier François III d'Aubusson, Duke of La Feuillade planned the Place des Victoires as both a property development project and a celebration of Louis XIV following the Treaties of Nijmegen, which in the late 1670s had put an end to his previous career as a military leader. He formed the plan in 1681 and purchased part of the grounds in 1684, the rest being acquired for the same purpose by the City of Paris. While not much is known about the details of the planning process, it is probable that Louis XIV's entourage, if not the king itself, was involved in the definition of its program of monarchical glorification, so that the monument eventually appears as a hybrid of private initiative and official project.: 10  The iconographic program echoes that of the ceiling of the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles and includes several of the same episodes, even though the depictions on the Victory Monument make less systematic use of allegory.: 31-32 La Feuillade had previously ordered a marble statue of Louis XIV from Desjardins in 1679. He offered it to the king in 1683 and it was placed in the Versailles Orangerie in 1684, where it remains to this day after having been altered during the Revolution and subsequently restored by Jean-François Lorta in 1815–1816. That statue served as an inspiration for that on the Victory Monument, even though the king's attire differs: ancient Roman in Versailles, versus coronation garb in Paris.
La Feuillade commissioned Desjardins to create the victory monument in 1682. The monument was completed and inaugurated on 26 March 1686, even as the surrounding buildings were unfinished or not started yet.


== Description ==


=== Monument proper ===
At the center of the square, the monument itself stood and consisted of three sections: a base with larger-than-life bronze statues of prisoners and military spoils; a square pedestal with four bronze reliefs commemorating specific events; and a colossal gilded statue of Louis XIV in coronation robe, trampling on Cerberus, with an allegory of Victory standing behind him on a globe and holding a laurel wreath above his head. The statue was more than four meters high, and the entire monument's total height was about 12 meters. The monument included numerous celebratory inscriptions,: 28  including a main dedicace in Latin on the front which read Viro Immortali (""To the Immortal Man""), an unambiguous reference to Louis.Each of the four prisoners simultaneously evoked an age of life and a specific emotion, and was also widely understood to refer to a vanquished nation: youth / hope / Spain; adulthood / rebellion / Holland; middle age / grief / Brandenburg; and old age / despondency / the Holy Roman Empire. The link with European states, however, was not made entirely explicit.: 24  Three of the figures were easy to identify as they represented France's main adversaries of the time, but the forth one, now understood as representing Brandenburg, has been misinterpreted variously in the past as the Duchy of Savoy or the Ottoman Empire. Between them were scattered broken weapons and military emblems, including an imperial ensign that anachronistically combines the SPQR motto of Ancient Rome with the double-headed eagle of the Holy Roman Empire.
Desjardins's relief plates on the pedestal commemorated four events viewed as particularly representative of Louis XIV's glory: on the front, an allegory of the Peace of Nijmegen of 1678–1679, with Louis XIV bringing Peace to Europe, the latter two represented as female allegories; on the rear, an idealized: 18  depiction of Louis XIV accepting the excuses of Spain's ambassador on 24 March 1662, a noted episode in the history of precedence among European monarchies; and on the sides, two military actions in which La Feuillade had participated, the crossing of the Rhine of June 1672 and the Siege of Besançon of 1674. Desjardins was also commissioned to produce four circular medallions (tondi) in bronze for the base of the monument, but only two were eventually installed there while the other two were replaced by inscriptions: The Destruction of Heresy, referring to the Edict of Fontainebleau of 1685 that revoked the Edict of Nantes of 1598 and led to the expulsion of France's Protestants or Huguenots; and The Abolition of Duels, referring to Louis's various initiatives starting in 1662 and especially his ordinance of 1679 by which he attempted to put an end to duels as a form of private justice in the French nobility. Desjardins's other two medallions, on the Doge of Genoa and the Swedes in Germany, were reused in the side lanterns.: 27 


=== Side lanterns and medallions ===
Around the monument, on four points of the near-circular square, were monumental lanterns (French: fanaux), each of them made of three columns of colored marble holding a naval lamp and decorated with two garlands of three circular medallions each, thus six by lantern. These lanterns provided for the illumination of the square and monument at night. In practice, however, they were not all completed. Some of the medallions were only temporary ones made in stucco, and possibly no more than half of the total (i.e. a dozen) were produced in bronze. Aside from the two initially created by Desjardins for the central monument, the others medallions were created by Flemish sculptor Jean Regnault (or Arnould) and caster Pierre Le Nègre, based on drawings by Pierre Mignard.: 29 A contemporary engraving gives the following list for the themes of the 24 medallions: 1. Battle of Rocroi in 1643; 2. Restoration of military discipline (reform of 1665); 3. Dutch rescued in Münster, 1664 (actually 1665 during the Second Anglo-Dutch War); 4. Fight of Saint-Gotthard in Hungary, 1665 (actually 1664); 5. Tournai, Lille and C. taken in 1667 (during the War of Devolution; ""C."" may be either Courtrai or Charleroi); 6. Justice reform in 1667 (the Code Louis); 7. Pyramid erected in Rome in 1664 and torn down in 1668 (the Corsican Guard Affair); 8. Takeover of Maastricht in 1673; 9. Battle of Seneffe in 1674; 10.

== Reception ==
The monument was generally well received on esthetic grounds and was widely considered Desjardins's major masterpiece. In the 1692 portrait of Desjardins submitted by Hyacinthe Rigaud for entry into the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture, the sitter was represented with his hand on the captive statue of Holland.At the same time, the entire project was criticized for the unrestrained adulation of Louis XIV and humiliation of fellow European nations that were inherent in the program. The March 1686 inauguration ceremony, complete with artillery salvos, military march, incense and genuflections, was considered way over the top by the Duke of Saint-Simon who attended it while a child and found it verging on cult. François-Timoléon de Choisy similarly mocked the elevation of Louis to godlike status as a hubristic echo of pagan Roman emperor-worship. Anonymous poems, pamphlets and caricatures were circulated both in France and abroad, lambasting the monument and not least the ""immortal man"" dedicace, which, by denying the monarch's mortality, put into question his responsibility before God.: 161 The offensive depiction of France's neighbors as vanquished captives did nothing to help French diplomacy, and was viewed several decades later as having possibly contributed to the kingdom's isolation.: 160  A follow-up bombastic urban design project on a larger scale than the Place des Victoires, started in 1685 and intended to be named the Place de Nos Conquêtes, was sharply toned down in 1699 to a more domestically-focused Place Louis-le-Grand. That year, Louis XIV's senior official Louis Phélypeaux, comte de Pontchartrain specifically referred in a letter to the Académie des Inscriptions to the ""reliefs, slaves, and inscriptions of the statue of the Place des Victoires"" as the example not to follow while aiming at something ""wise and reasonable"" for the new square, now known as the Place Vendôme.: 161 


== Later history ==
The lanterns were permanently turned off in 1699, decommissioned by royal order in 1717, and dismantled in 1718. La Feuillade's son donated their twelve precious marble columns to the Theatines congregation of Paris, then established on what is now Quai Voltaire, for their unfinished church. After his death in 1725 the Theatines, who were short of money, sold them to the Paris Foreign Missions Society, the Couvent de la Madeleine de Traisnel, and Sens Cathedral. The latter reemployed four of the columns for its alter baldachin, erected in 1742 under Archbishop Jean-Joseph Languet de Gergy on a design by Giovanni Niccolò Servandoni.In 1790, the statues of the captives, deemed an offense to the new spirit of freedom, were ""liberated"" and initially relocated at the Louvre Palace. On 10 August 1792, during that day's insurrection, the monument's main statue was toppled to be melted into cannons. Parts of the decoration, including the four bronze reliefs, were salvaged by Alexandre Lenoir for his Musée des Monuments français.A temporary woodwork monument was erected to celebrate the insurrectionist victims of 10 August 1792, which in turn was removed during the Consulate. Napoleon then commissioned a bronze heroic statue of General Louis Desaix which was produced by Claude Dejoux and inaugurated in 1810. The nude sculpture was widely disliked and removed in 1814 before Napoleon's fall. Its metal was used for the new Equestrian statue of Henry IV by François-Frédéric Lemot, inaugurated on the Pont Neuf in 1818. A more permanent replacement was erected in 1822, namely an equestrian statue of Louis XIV by François Joseph Bosio. This monument bears no visual relationship with Desjardin's original, even though its program overlaps especially as the 1672 crossing of the Rhine is represented on one of Bosio's two bronze reliefs on the pedestal.
Meanwhile, the statues of the four captives were placed in 1804 in front of Les Invalides, where they remained until 1939. In 1960 their ownership was transferred to the Louvre, which in 1961 had them deposited in the Parc de Sceaux where they remained until 1992. In 1993, in the context of the museum's expansion known as the Grand Louvre project, they were transferred, together with other preserved parts of the monument, to their current location in the newly created Cour Puget, where they dominate the courtyard's lower section.Eleven bronze medallions are also preserved at the Louvre. The two that decorated the monument's basis became part of the museum's collections in 1836 after having been kept at the Musée des Monuments français: 

The Abolition of Duelling
The Destruction of Heresy (1685)Five medallions from the lanterns were purchased during the Revolution by King George III of Great Britain and donated by the UK to France in 1914:
The Restoration of Military Discipline (1665), by Arnould
The Pyramid of the Corsicans in Rome (1668), by Arnould
Capture of a City, believed in the past to depict the Siege of Valenciennes (1676–1677), by Arnould
The Reestablishment of the Swedes in Germany (1679), by Desjardins
The Submission of the Doge of Genoa (1685), by DesjardinsThe remaining four , all by Arnould, were acquired by the Louvre between 1980 and 2006: 

The Victory of Saint Gotthard (1664)
A second version of The Reestablishment of the Swedes in Germany, after Desjardins's was found not respectful enough of the Swedish monarchy
The Junction of the Two Seas (1681)

It was designed and sculpted by Martin Desjardins between 1682 and 1686 on a commission by François d'Aubusson, Duke of La Feuillade.",The Louis XIV Victory Monument was designed by Martin Desjardins.,1
Anti-CRISPR,"Anti-CRISPR (Anti-Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats or Acr) is a group of proteins found in phages, that inhibit the normal activity of CRISPR-Cas, the immune system of certain bacteria. CRISPR consists of genomic sequences that can be found in prokaryotic organisms, that come from bacteriophages that infected the bacteria beforehand, and are used to defend the cell from further viral attacks. Anti-CRISPR results from an evolutionary process occurred in phages in order to avoid having their genomes destroyed by the prokaryotic cells that they will infect.Before the discovery of this type of family proteins, the acquisition of mutations was the only way known that phages could use to avoid CRISPR-Cas mediated shattering, by reducing the binding affinity of the phage and CRISPR. Nonetheless, bacteria have mechanisms to retarget the mutant bacteriophage, a process that it is called ""priming adaptation"". So, as far as researchers currently know, anti-CRISPR is the most effective way to ensure the survival of phages throughout the infection process of bacteria.


== History ==
Anti-CRISPR systems were first seen in Pseudomonas aeruginosa prophages, which disabled type I-F CRISPR–Cas system, characteristic of some strains of these bacteria. After analysing the genomic sequences of these phages, genes codifying five different Anti-CRISPR proteins (also named Acrs) were discovered. Such proteins were AcrF1, AcrF2, AcrF3, AcrF4 and AcrF5. Research found none of these proteins disrupted the expression of Cas genes nor the assembling of CRISPR molecules, so it was thought that those type I-F proteins directly affected the CRISPR–Cas interference.Further investigation confirmed this hypothesis with the discovery of 4 other proteins (AcrE1, AcrE2, AcrE3 and AcrE4), which were shown to impede Pseudomonas aeruginosa’s CRISPR-Cas system.  Furthermore, the locus of the genes codifying these type I-E proteins was really close to the one responsible for the type I-F proteins expression in the same group of phages, leading to the conclusion that both types of proteins worked together. However, these first nine proteins shared no common sequence motifs, which would have made easier the identification of new Anti-CRISPR protein families.
Later on, it was seen that phages that produced such proteins also encoded a putative transcriptional regulator named Aca 1 (anti-CRISPR associated 1) which was genetically located really close to the anti-CRISPR genes. This regulatory protein is supposed to be the responsible for the anti-CRISPR gene expression during the infectious cycle of the phage,  therefore, both types of proteins (anti-CRISPR and Aca1) seem to work together as a single mechanism.After some studies, a similar amino-acid sequence to that of Aca1 was found, leading to the discovery of Aca2, a new family of Aca proteins. Aca2 also revealed the existence of five new groups of type I-F anti-CRISPR proteins due to their genomic proximity: AcrF6, AcrF7, AcrF8, AcrF9 and AcrF10. These proteins were not only present in Pseudomonas aeruginosa’s phages, as they also affected other cells of the Pseudomonadota (formerly Proteobacteria).Thanks to the use of bioinformatic tools, in 2016, AcrIIC1, AcrIIC2 and AcrIIC3 protein families were discovered in Neisseria meningitidis (which had been infected by phages previously). Such proteins were the first inhibitors of type II CRISPR–Cas to be found (concretely, they impeded II-C CRISPR–Cas9, the type of mechanism used in the genetic edition of human cells). A year later, a study confirmed the presence of type II-A CRISPR–Cas9 inhibitors (AcrIIA1, AcrIIA2, AcrIIA3 and AcrIIA4) in Listeria monocytogenes (infected by bacteriophages which introduced the anti-CRISPR proteins). Two of those proteins (AcrIIA2 and AcrIIA4) were demonstrated to work properly against Streptococcus pyogenes type II-A defensive CRISPR system.
The result of all this research has been the discovery of 21 different Anti-CRISPR protein families, despite other inhibitors may exist due to the quick mutational process of phages. Thus, more research is needed to unravel the complexity of anti-CRISPR systems.


== Types ==
Anti-CRISPR genes can be found in different parts of the phage DNA: in the capsid, the tail and at the extreme end. Moreover, it has been found that many MGEs have two or even three Acr genes in a single operon, which suggest that they could have been exchanged between MGEs.As all proteins, Acr family proteins are formed by the translation and transduction of the genes, and their classification is based on the type of CRISPR-Cas system they inhibit, due to the fact that each anti-CRISPR protein inhibits a specific CRISPR-Cas system. Although not many anti-CRISPR proteins have been discovered, these are the ones that have been found so far:

So far, genes encoding anti-CRISPR proteins have been found in myophages, siphophages, putative conjugative elements and pathogenicity islands.
Attempts have been made to find common surrounding genetic features of anti-CRISPR genes, but without any success. Nevertheless, the presence of an aca gene just below anti-CRISPR genes has been observed.The first Acr protein families to be discovered were AcrF1, AcrF2, AcrF3, AcrF4 and AcrF5. These inhibitors are mainly found in Pseudomonas phages, which are capable of infecting Pseudomonas aeruginosas possessing a type I‑F CRISPR–Cas system. Then, in another study, AcrE1, AcrE2, AcrE3 and AcrE4 protein families were found to also inhibit the type I‑F CRISPR–Cas in Pseudomonas aeruginosas.Later on, AcrF6, AcrF7, AcrF8, AcrF9 and AcrF10 protein families, which were also able to inhibit type I‑F CRISPR–Cas, were found to be very common in Pseudomonadota MGEs.The first inhibitors of a type II CRISPR–Cas system were then discovered: AcrIIC1, AcrIIC2 and AcrIIC3, that block the type II‑C CRISPR–Cas9 activity of Neisseria meningitidis.Finally, AcrIIA1, AcrIIA2, AcrIIA3 and AcrIIA4 were found. These protein families have the ability to inhibit the type II‑A CRISPR–Cas system of Listeria monocytogenes.As for the naming convention of Acr family proteins, it is established as follows: firstly, the type of system inhibited, then a numerical value referring to the protein family and finally the source of the specific anti-CRISPR protein. For example, AcrF9Vpa is active against the type I-F CRISPR–Cas system. It also was the ninth anti-CRISPR described for this system, and it is encoded in an integrated MGE in a Vibrio parahaemolyticus genome.


== Structure ==
As exposed above, there is a wide spectrum of anti-CRISPR proteins, but few of these have been deeply studied. One of the most studied and well-defined Acrs is AcrIIA4, which inhibits Cas9, thus blocking the II-A CRISPR-Cas system of Streptococcus pyogenes.


=== AcrIIA4 ===
The protein was solved using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR); it contains 87 residues and its molecular weight is 10.182 kDa. AcrIIA4 contains:

3 antiparallel β-strands (the first, from residues 16 to 19, the second, from 29 to 33, and the third, from 40 to 44) that form a β-sheet. This represents a 16,1% of the total number of amino acids, as 14 of them form the β-strands.
3 α-helices (the first, 2–13 residues, the second, 50–59 residues, and the third, 68–85 residues).
1 310 helix placed between the first (β1) and second (β2) β-strands, which starts at residue 22 and end in residue 25. The total helical part is composed of 40 residues, which is a 50,6% of the protein.
Loops joining the different secondary structures.There is a good definition of the secondary structures, as the three α-helices are packed near the three β-strands. Strikingly, between β3 strand, α2 and α3 helices, there is a hydrophobic core, originated by a cluster of aromatic side chains which are attracted by non-covalent interactions, such as pi stacking. Moreover, as it is an acidic protein, there is a high concentration of negatively charged residues in the loops between β3 and α2, between α2 and α3, and in the first part of α3, which may play an important role in the inhibition of Cas9, as negative charges might imitate phosphates of nucleic acids.


=== AcrF1 ===
On the other hand, there is another Acr, AcrF1, which may not have been as studied as the explained above, although there is a good description of its structure. It inhibits the I-F CRISPR-Cas system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Maxwell et al. solved the 3D structure using NMR.
The protein contains 78 residues, between which interact to form secondary structures. The structure of AcrF1 is formed of two anti-parallel α-helices and a β-sheet, which contains four anti-parallel β-strands. This β-sheet is placed in the contrary side of the α-helical part, which creates a hydrophobic core formed of 13 amino acids. Turns can also be found in different parts of the protein, for instance, joining the β-strands.There are surface residues which actively participate in the active site of AcrF1, two of which are tyrosines (Y6 and Y20) and the third amino acid is a glutamic acid (E31), as their mutation by an alanine causes a 100-fold decrease in the activity of the protein (with Y20A and E31A mutations), and a 107-fold decrease when Y6 is mutated.
The different structures that form the protein create a strange combination, as Maxwell et al. conducted a DALI search in order to find similarities between other proteins, and they found no informative similarities.


== Function ==


=== Avoiding destruction of the phage DNA ===
The principal function of anti-CRISPR proteins is to interact with specific components of CRISPR-Cas systems, such as the effector nucleases, to avoid the destruction of the phage DNA (by binding or cleavage).A phage introduces its DNA into a prokaryotic cell, usually the cell detects a sequence known as ""target"", that activates CRISPR-Cas immune system, but the presence of an initial sequence (before the target) encoding the formation of Acr proteins, avoids phage destruction. Acr proteins are formed before the target sequence is read. This way, the CRISPR-Cas system is blocked before it can develop a response.
The procedure starts with the CRISPR locus being transcribed into crRNAs (CRISPR RNA). CrRNAs combine with Cas proteins forming a ribonucleoprotein complex called Cascade. This complex surveys the cell to find complementary sequences of the crRNA. When this sequence is found, the Cas3 nuclease is recruited to the Cascade, and the target DNA from the phage is cleaved. But, for instance, when AcrF1 and AcrF2 are found (anti-CRISPR proteins), these interact with Cas7f and Cas8f-Cas5f, respectively, not allowing the binding to the phage DNA. Moreover, the cleaving of the target is prevented by the union between AcrF3 and Cas3.
The majority of Acr genes are located next to anti-CRISPR-associated (Aca) genes, which encode proteins with a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif. Aca genes are preserved, and researchers are using them to identify Acr genes, but the function of the proteins they encode is not totally clear. The Acr-associated promoter produces high levels of Acr transcription just after the phage DNA injection into the bacteria takes place and, afterward, Aca proteins repress the transcription. If this wasn't repressed, the constant transcription of the gene would be lethal to the phage. Therefore, Aca activity is essential to ensure its survival.


=== Phage-phage cooperation ===
Moreover, it has been verified that bacteria with CRISPR-Cas systems are still partially immune to Acr. Consequently, initial abortive phage infections may be unable to hamper CRISPR immunity, but phage-phage cooperation can increasingly boost Acr production and promote immunosuppression, which might produce an increase on the vulnerability of the host cell to reinfection, and finally allow a successful infection and spreading of a second phage. This cooperation creates an epidemiological tipping point, in which, depending on the initial density of Acr-phages and the strength of CRISPR/Acr binding, phages can either be eliminated or originate a phage epidemic (the number of bacteriophages is amplified).If the starting levels of phages are high enough, the density of immunosuppressed hosts reaches a critical point where there are more successful infections than unsuccessful ones. Then, an epidemic begins. If this point is not reached, phage extinction occurs, and immunosuppressed hosts recover their initial state.


=== Phage immune evasion ===
It has become clear that Acr proteins play an important role in allowing phage immune evasion, though it is still unclear how anti-CRISPR proteins synthesis can overcome the host’s CRISPR-Cas system, which can shatter the phage genome within minutes after the infection.


== Mechanisms ==
Within all the Anti-CRISPR proteins that have been discovered so far, mechanisms have been described for only 15 of among them. These mechanisms can be divided into three different types: crRNA loading interference, DNA binding blockage and DNA cleavage prevention.


=== CrRNA loading interference ===
CrRNA (CRISPR RNA) loading interference mechanism has been mainly associated with the AcrIIC2 protein family. In order to block Cas9 activity, it prevents the correct assembly of the crRNA‐Cas9 complex.


=== DNA binding blockage ===
AcrIIC2 has been shown not to be the only one capable of blocking DNA binding. There are 11 other Acr family proteins that can also carry it out. Some among those are AcrIF1, AcrIF2, and AcrIF10, which act on different subunits of the Cascade effector complex of the type I‐F CRISPR‐Cas system, preventing the DNA to bind to the complex.Furthermore, AcrIIC3 prevents DNA binding by promoting dimerization of Cas9  and AcrIIA2 mimics DNA, thereby blocking the PAM recognition residues and consequently preventing dsDNA (double-stranded DNA) recognition and binding.


=== DNA cleavage prevention ===
AcrE1, AcrIF3 and AcrIIC1 can prevent target DNA cleavage. Using X-ray crystallography, AcrE1 was discovered to bind to the CRISPR associated Cas3. Likewise, biochemical and structural analysis of AcrIF3 showed its capacity of binding to Cas3 as a dimer so as to prevent the recruitment of Cas3 to the Cascade complex. Finally, thanks to biochemical and structural AcrIIC1 studies, it was found that it binds to the active site of the HNH endonuclease domain in Cas9, which prevents DNA from cleaving. Thus, it turns Cas9 into an inactive but DNA bound state.


== Applications ==


=== Reducing CRISPR-Cas9 off-target cuts ===
AcrIIA4 is one of the proteins responsible for the CRISPR-Cas9 system inhibition, the mechanism used in mammalian cells edition. Addition of AcrIIA4 in human cells avoids Cas9 interaction with the CRISPR system, reducing its ability to cut DNA. However, diverse studies have reached the conclusion that adding it in small proportions after the genome editing has been done, reduces the number of off-target cuts at the concrete sites in which Cas9 interacts, a thing that makes the whole system much more precise.


=== Avoiding ecological consequences ===
One of the main objectives of using CRISPR-Cas9 technology is eradicating diseases, some of which are found in disease vectors, such as mosquitoes. Anti-CRISPR proteins can impede gene drive, which could create uncertain and catastrophic consequences in ecosystems.


=== Detect presence of Cas9 in a sample ===
In order to know whether a certain bacterium synthesises Cas9, and therefore uses CRISPR-Cas9, or to detect accidental or not allowed use of this system, AcrIIC1 can be used. As the aforementioned protein binds to Cas9, a centrifugal microfluidic platform has been designed to detect it and determine its catalytic activity.


=== Phage therapy ===
Antibiotic resistance is a public health problem that is constantly increasing, because of the bad use of antibiotics. Phage therapy consists of the infection of bacteria using phages, which are much more specific and cause less side effects than antibiotics. Acrs could inhibit the CRISPR-Cas9 system of some bacteria and allow these phages to infect bacterial cells without being attacked by its immune system.

William W. Ker,"The William W. Ker was a 19th-century Pennsylvania pilot schooner built in 1889 in Wilmington, Delaware. She was designed by Edward Burgess for the Pennsylvania pilots and was built for speed. She was a favorite with the pilots and was considered the fastest pilot boat on the coast. The Ker was hit and sank by a steamer off the Five Fathom Bank in 1900.


== Construction and service ==
The two-masted pilot schooner W. W. Ker was launched on November 27, 1889, from the Jackson & Sharp Company at Wilmington, Delaware for the Pennsylvania pilots. She was designed by Edward Burgess and took the place of the Enoch Turley, which was lost with all on board in the April 6, 1889 storm.
The W. W. Ker was named in honor of the Assistant District Attorney of Philadelphia Captain William W. Ker.Pilot James R. Kelley from the Turley was present at the launch. A bottle of champagne was broken on her bow by Mary Conner, a granddaughter of pilot George H. Conner. As she broke the bottle she said: ""I christen thee W. W. Ker."" The vessel's dimensions were 88 ft. in length; 22 ft. breadth of beam; 9 ft. depth of hold; 72 ft. mainmast and 64 ft. foremast. She was built for speed.By August 1893, the Committee on Navigation and Pilots of the Board of Port Wardens recognized only four pilot boats for the Port of Philadelphia, the E. C. Knight, John G. Whilldin, W. W. Ker and J. Henry Edmunds.On 19 Mar 1897, the William W. Ker and the John G. Whilldin cruised near the  Fenwick Island Light vessel, waiting to board ships coming from the Caribbean. She was a favorite with the pilots and was considered the fastest pilot boat on the coast.


== End of service ==
On February 18, 1898, due to the introduction of steam service at the Delaware Breakwater, the schooner William W. Ker was bought from the Philadelphia pilots to Captain Redman for mackerel fishing. The Ker would often fish on the banks off Cape Henlopen.On June 27, 1900, she was hit and sank by a steamer off the Five Fathom Bank by one of the old Dominion Line, the Hamilton steamers bound from New York to Norfolk, Virginia. Captain Redmond of New York was in command of the Ker when she went down. Sixteen men were rescued and taken to Norfolk.

Forbidden Zone,"Forbidden Zone is an American absurdist musical fantasy comedy film produced and directed by independent filmmaker Richard Elfman, and co-written by Elfman and Matthew Bright. Shot in 1977 and 1978, the film premiered in 1980 and was distributed in 1982. Originally shot on black-and-white film, Forbidden Zone is based upon the stage performances of the Los Angeles theater troupe The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo, of which Elfman, Bright and many of the cast and crew were a part, and revolves around an alternate universe accessed through a door in the house of the Hercules family.The composing debut of Danny Elfman, it stars Hervé Villechaize, Susan Tyrrell and members of the Mystic Knights, with appearances by Warhol superstar Viva, Joe Spinell and The Kipper Kids. Villechaize kicked his cheque back into production and even painted sets on weekends. The only paid actor was Phil Gordon, who played Flash; all the other SAG actors put their money back into the show.The film was made as an attempt to capture the essence of The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo's live performances in a cinematic sense, and also as a means for both director Elfman to retire from music to work on film projects, and to serve as a transition between the group's former cabaret style and a new wave-based style. Amid negative reactions to content in the film that had been perceived as being offensive, Forbidden Zone was screened as a midnight movie, where it was met with positive notices, and developed a large and eventually worldwide cult following. In 2004, the film was digitally restored and released on DVD, and in 2008, the film was colorized.Said Elfman, ""Doing anything original is taking a chance. Financially it bankrupted me and we lost our house. But I'm still glad I did it (although I'd change a few things if I had a time machine, of course).""A prospective sequel, entitled Forbidden Zone 2: The Forbidden Galaxy, has long been in development by Elfman, who launched a successful crowdfunding campaign in 2014 to raise an initial sum. As of 2019, the sequel is still in the stages of development but regularly updated and discussed by Elfman. Elfman has also licensed Forbidden Zone as an intellectual property for manufacturers to produce collectibles based on the film's characters.


== Plot ==
The film begins on ""Friday, April 17"" at 4 p.m. in Venice, California. Huckleberry P. Jones (local pimp, narcotics peddler, and slumlord) enters a vacant house that he owns. While stashing heroin in the basement, he stumbles upon a mysterious door and enters it, falling into the Sixth Dimension, from which he promptly escapes. After retrieving the heroin, he sells the house to the Hercules family. On their way to school, Frenchy Hercules and her brother Flash have a conversation with Squeezit Henderson, who tells them that, while being violently beaten by his mother, he has a vision of his transgender sister René, who had fallen into the Sixth Dimension through the door in the Hercules' basement.
Frenchy returns home to confide in her mother, and decides to take just a ""little peek"" behind the forbidden door in the basement. After arriving in the Sixth Dimension, she is captured by the perpetually topless Princess, who brings Frenchy to the rulers of the Sixth Dimension, the midget King Fausto and his queen, Doris. When the king falls for Frenchy, Doris orders their frog servant, Bust Rod, to lock her up. In order to make sure that Frenchy is not harmed, Fausto tells Bust Rod to take Frenchy to Cell 63, where the king keeps his favorite concubines (as well as René).
The next day at school, Flash tries to convince Squeezit to help him rescue René and Frenchy. When Squeezit refuses, Flash enlists the help of Gramps instead. In the Sixth Dimension, they speak to an old Jewish man who tells them how to help Frenchy escape, but they soon are captured by Bust Rod. Doris interrogates Flash and Gramps before lowering them into a large septic tank. She then plots her revenge against Frenchy, relocating all the denizens of Cell 63 to a torture chamber. She leaves the Princess to oversee Frenchy's torture and execution, but when a fuse is blown, the torture is put on hold and the prisoners from Cell 63 are relocated to keep the King from finding them.
After escaping the septic tank, Flash and Gramps come across a woman who tells them that she was once happily married to the king, until Doris stole the throne by seducing her, ""even though she's not my type"". The ex-queen has been sitting in her cell for 1,000 years, and has been writing a screenplay in order to keep her sanity. Meanwhile, Pa Hercules is blasted through the stratosphere by an explosion caused by improperly extinguishing his cigarette in a vat of highly flammable tar during his work break at the La Brea Tar Pit Factory. After re-entry, Pa falls through the Hercules family basement and into the Sixth Dimension, where he is imprisoned.
Finding a phone, Flash calls Squeezit and again asks for his help. Finally, Squeezit agrees to go into the Sixth Dimension to help rescue Frenchy and René. There, he is captured by Satan, with whom he makes a deal to bring him the Princess in exchange for Satan's help freeing René and Frenchy. Squeezit accomplishes this task, but has failed to include himself in the deal to rescue his friends, and the devil has him decapitated. Queen Doris sends Bust Rod to keep an eye on the king, and to ensure he doesn't find out where she's hidden Frenchy.
Fausto catches Bust Rod and forces him to lead him to Frenchy and René, whom he orders to leave the Sixth Dimension to avoid the Queen's wrath. However, en route to safety, René is stricken with pseudo-menstrual cramps, and they are again captured by the frog. Squeezit's head, which has now sprouted chicken wings, finds the king and informs him of what has happened.
While preparing to kill Frenchy, Doris is confronted by the ex-queen, and the two engage in a cat-fight, with Doris eventually coming out as the victor. Just as she is about to kill Frenchy, Fausto stops her, explaining that Satan's Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo are holding the Princess hostage, and will kill her should anything befall Frenchy. Flash and Gramps arrive, and Flash is knocked down by Gramps. Ma Hercules enters and, seeing a seemingly dead Flash, shoots Doris. Fausto mourns Doris, then marries Frenchy.
The surviving characters look toward a great future as they plan to take over everyone and everything in the Galaxy.

== Production ==


=== Development ===
The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo were formed in late 1972 by Richard Elfman, as a musical theatre troupe. As Richard's interest shifted to filmmaking, he passed leadership of the band to younger brother Danny Elfman. Danny, who had begun to lose interest in musical theatre, had gained interest in other musical styles such as ska, and had become ""sick of lugging around so much stuff with the theatre troupe. Towards the end"", he remembers, ""it was a big production... there was, like a semi full of stuff. And that was becoming burdensome. So, for me, the idea of being a band that can fit all their gear into a van and set up in a club, and an hour later be playing, became a goal."" Production began during a transitional period when the group was moving from its cabaret style towards a more pop/rock format; by the time the film was completed, the band had shortened its name to Oingo Boingo.The film was originally conceived as The Hercules Family, a 16mm musical that consisted of twelve musical numbers and a story loosely constructed around them. But as the project grew to 35mm and the storyline evolved, Richard Elfman found himself re-shooting many of the original scenes to fit the new film. Two sequences from the original 16mm footage were featured on the 2004 DVD release: one of Danny Elfman, as Satan, performing ""Minnie the Moocher"" (later reshot with visual elements borrowed from the original 16mm sequence and alternate lyrics), and another of Marie-Pascale Elfman, singing ""Johnny"". The sequence with Elfman as Satan, and members of the Oingo Boingo as his minions, came from live shows, in which the band would perform Cab Calloway tunes like ""St. James Infirmary Blues"" in the same costumes.Marie-Pascale Elfman, at the time of shooting, was married to director Richard Elfman. She designed the film's expressionistic sets and starred in the film. Actor and former Mystic Knight Gene Cunningham helped fund the film. When Cunningham and Elfman ran out of money during production, Richard and Marie-Pascale Elfman helped finance by selling houses, before Carl Borack put money into the production in order for Elfman to complete the film. According to Elfman, he had originally intended the film to be screened in color, stating that the original plan was to ship the film to China, where each frame would be hand-tinted, but that this plan was not practical within the production costs. Elfman ultimately went bankrupt during the production of Forbidden Zone and had to assign the rights away in order to finish the film; in 2015, Elfman regained the full rights to Forbidden Zone.


=== Casting ===
Actor Hervé Villechaize was a former roommate of co-writer and co-star Matthew Bright; Villechaize had previously dated co-star Susan Tyrrell. The Elfmans' grandfather, Herman Bernstein, also appeared in the film, and Richard Elfman's accountant appeared under the name ""Hyman Diamond"" because Elfman had no idea whether or not he wanted to be credited. Others who worked on the film include The Kipper Kids (Brian Routh and Martin von Haselberg), Joe Spinell, and former Warhol superstar Viva.


=== Writing ===
Forbidden Zone featured Bright's first work on film, and his only work as an actor (under the name ""Toshiro Baloney""). A founding member of the Mystic Knights, Bright later became a screenwriter and director in his own right. Bright's credits include Freeway, Ted Bundy, and Tiptoes. Bright and director Richard Elfman's only dispute during the screenwriting process was over a scene in which his character, Squeezit, was originally to have been beaten up for eight minutes and having the walls wiped with his blood. Another scene cut from the script would have had Squeezit being castrated. According to Bright, ""I didn't have any sense of limits or balance then, at the time, I... you know, I was just, didn't know what I was doing. I needed reining in."" During filming, Bright was sitting on the set in costume when a lighting stand fell onto his head, cracking his skull, and he had to be rushed to the hospital. When Bright returned to work the next day, he had a mild concussion and whiplash, but he continued with filming.


=== Directing ===
Richard Elfman had never gone to film school when production started, and ""I didn't know what I was getting into."" The production, from its original 16mm roots to its finish, took three years. Cast and crew members would sleep on the film's stage, wearing spare gorilla suits to stay warm. Among the film's artistic influences included 1940s big band and jazz music and Max Fleischer cartoons of the 1930s (such as Betty Boop). Some of the film's cast was made up of non-professionals cast off the street. In one scene, Richard Elfman brought in a young man to mouth the words of ""Bim Bam Boom"", but when he was put in front of the camera, he stood there as the scene was shot. Elfman left the scene in the film by editing in Bright's lips over the actor's face. Another scene featured homeless men.


=== Animation ===
The film's animation was created by then-unknown animator John Muto. Because of the film's low budget, Muto created all of the film's animation sequences himself. Muto made frequent use of airbrush techniques to establish for himself a distinctive style. For sequences in which live-action and animation were combined, the actors were photographed in tight head-on and profile shots, and the photos were cut out and pasted into the animation in a style recalling Terry Gilliam's work on Monty Python's Flying Circus. Muto also credits the Fleischer Brothers as another inspiration.


=== Music ===

Forbidden Zone was the first film scored by Danny Elfman, who would eventually score, among other films, Batman, The Nightmare Before Christmas, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The song Witch's Egg was written by Georg Michalski and Tyrrell. In some scenes, characters lip synch to old records, including recordings by Cab Calloway, Josephine Baker, and others.
The alphabet song performed in a classroom scene was inspired by the ""Swinging the Alphabet"" song from The Three Stooges short Violent Is the Word for Curly.For the ""Yiddishe Charleston"" scene, Richard Elfman had shot the sequence with him lip-syncing to an old recording of the song, but was later unable to acquire the rights to the recording, and had to record a new version of the song while attempting to sync the new recording with the footage.The film's soundtrack has also become popular, and its theme song was eventually reused by Danny Elfman, who rearranged it as The Dilbert Zone for use as the theme for the television series Dilbert.


== Release and reception ==
Forbidden Zone premiered at the Los Angeles Filmex film festival in 1980, later receiving a limited theatrical distribution as a midnight movie through The Samuel Goldwyn Company in 1982. Following its theatrical run, Forbidden Zone fell out of circulation for roughly twenty years, though bootleg recordings helped find the film new life as a highly sought-after and well-regarded cult film. In 2004, Film Threat magazine dubbed Forbidden Zone ""the Citizen Kane of underground movies"". The film currently has a score of 83% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 6.6/10.


=== Home media ===
It was digitally restored and released on Region 1 DVD by Fantoma in 2004, receiving a Region 2 release by Arrow Film Distributors Ltd. in 2006. In 2008, with Elfman's blessing and input, a colorized version of Forbidden Zone was issued on DVD by Legend Films, and was later screened in exhibition at the New York Museum of Modern Art in 2010. Arrow released a Blu-Ray edition in the UK in 2012, followed by ""Ultimate Edition"" North American Blu-Ray and DVD releases by MVD Entertainment Group in 2015; all contained both the black-and-white and color versions.


=== Controversies ===
Upon its original release, Forbidden Zone was singled out for criticism for its use of broadly-drawn racist, homophobic, antisemitic and anti-Christian visuals and characters. Elfman, himself of Jewish heritage, has disputed many of these accusations, noting that elements seen as homophobic were inspired by his time as a director and occasional performer in the San Francisco avant-garde drag troupe The Cockettes, while the character of ""Mr. Bernstein"", accused of being an exaggerated Jewish stereotype, was played by Elfman's Jewish grandfather Herman Bernstein, of whom Elfman wryly asserted ""wasn't acting"".In particular, Forbidden Zone has been criticized for its brief use of surreal blackface. In 2020, Elfman digitally removed the blackface images and replaced them with ""clown-face"". In an interview with Dread Central, he explained ""Going back to our very first test screening in 1980, there were a few things that really bugged me. The film is an absurdist fever-dream with hundreds of crazy, cartoonish images. I regretted the few seconds of Max Fleischer-era black-face and wanted to change it to 'clown-face'. But the film had – literally – bankrupted me, I had lost control and couldn't complete it exactly the way I wanted. Well, forty years later, I fucking can!"". Elfman's director's cut was released in early 2021.


== Legacy ==


=== Sequel ===
In June 2009, it was revealed through an entry on IMDb that Elfman had been developing a sequel to Forbidden Zone entitled Forbidden Zone 2: The Forbidden Galaxy. The prospective project was more formally detailed in March 2014 when Elfman launched a successful crowdfunding campaign on IndieGoGo to raise part of the film's financing. As of the campaign's most recent update in May 2023, Elfman confirmed the project is ""still alive"" and noting that he ""will not give up on FZ2"", describing Forbidden Zone 2 as ""number one on his bucket list."" ""As long as I am breathing, I will do Forbidden Zone 2!""


=== Stage show ===
In 2010, Forbidden Zone was performed as a live stage show with the support of Richard Elfman. It is a production of the Sacred Fools Theater Company, and premiered there in Los Angeles on Friday, May 21, 2010.


=== Mixed media ===
Richard Elfman entered into a licensing deal with the creative resource company, PANGEA, to provide licensees with the opportunity to create merchandise based on the cult film. According to articles that appeared in the media on May 3, 2016, the arrangement calls for content to be created that will include a Storyboard Book of the original film, featuring commentary and anecdotal notes from director. Shot glasses and sculpted pieces were among the list of immediate items that would be released. A fantasy novella series was also noted as being under development.Rocky Horror ""shadow cast"" companies have begun performing screenings of the film. Elfman sometimes participates in these live performances. He enters in a clown suit and beats a big bass drum that is accompanied by a Brazilian percussion ensemble—reminiscent of his former group, the Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo.The Syfy Channel has run a teaser piece musical number, ""Princess Polly"" from Forbidden Zone 2: The Forbidden Galaxy on its show Monster Man, starring Cleve Hall. Elfman opens the Forbidden Zone shadow cast shows (after the march in) with Erin Holt singing Princess Polly live in front of her screened “monster” image on stage.

Micromarket,"Micro Markets constitutes a retail sector closely associated with the vending machine industry. 
They employ automated self-checkout technology and are commonly found in locations requiring unattended payment systems. Micro Markets offer grab-and-go retail environments where customers can purchase products from open shelves, coolers, and freezers. Consumers use self-checkout kiosks for a streamlined experience.
Micro Markets resembles a modern convenience store but functions as a fusion of vending, foodservice, and refreshment services. They typically consist of open rack displays, refrigerated coolers or freezers, and self-checkout kiosks. 
The National Automatic Merchandising Association (NAMA) recognizes Micro Markets as a significant focus channel, along with vending, foodservice, and refreshment services.A typical Micro Market generally stocks between 150 and 400 products, a notable contrast to the standard vending machine's capacity of around 40 products. In addition to product variety, open flow layouts and cashless payment options reduce waiting times, promote multiple-item purchases, and increase transaction values compared to cash transactions.Micro Markets are appealing to vending industry operators due to their potential profitability. According to a study by Micro Market provider Parlevel Systems, a Micro Market in a location with 125 employees can generate over $1,000 per week on average. Statistics also indicate that replacing vending machines with Micro Markets increases location sales by around 80%. However, there are challenges such as theft associated with this technology.
Micro Market adoption has grown significantly due to the enhanced efficiency and convenience for consumers and operators. This growth has led to the replacement of banks of vending machines with Micro Markets. Since their inception in 2005, Micro Markets have witnessed steady adoption, with substantial growth between 2012 and 2016. During this period, active Micro Market locations increased by 574%, from 2,642 in 2012 to 17,806 in 2016. Micro Market sales grew by 42% between 2015 and 2016, accounting for 20% of total sales. In 2016, total sales included 456 million consumer transactions and over 660 million product purchases.Micro Markets are typically placed in closed environments like office breakrooms with 150 to 500 employees. However, technological innovations like 365 Retail Markets' ""nanomarket""™ are making Micro Markets viable in locations with fewer than 150 patrons. Locations with over 500 patrons benefit from the ""grab-and-go"" option appealing to a broader range of consumers.As per an assessment:

The next couple of years will clarify the
 overall size of the opportunity, but we expect it is actually more than double the initial 2013 projection of 33,500 [by 2022] [MicroMarket] sites and will ultimately deliver $4 billion[-]plus in channel sales.

Louis-Adolphe Paquet,"Louis-Adolphe Paquet (French pronunciation: [pɑkɛt]; also Pâquet; August 4, 1859 – February 4, 1942) was an influential French-Canadian theologian from the late 19th early 20th century, and a major North American proponent and actor in the rebirth of Neo-Scholasticism. Although nowhere as politically influential as his uncle Benjamin Pâquet had been, he was well respected and his opinion helped shape the doctrines and policies of the Canadian church in the early 20th century.


== Biography ==
Joseph-Louis-Adolphe Paquet was born on August 4, 1859, to a farmer couple, Adolphe Pâquet and Éléonore Demers, on the family domain in Saint-Nicolas, on the southern shore of the Saint Lawrence River opposite Quebec City. He was their eldest son, though not their eldest child, which was his sister Joséphine. Adolphe Pâquet would later be mayor of the municipality in the 1870s and 1880s. Louis-Adolphe came from an influential family: two of his uncles, Benjamin and Louis-Honoré Pâquet, were notable churchmen, and one of his cousins, Étienne-Théodore, would later be elected to the provincial legislature.
Paquet studied in nearby Saint-Louis-de-Lotbinière, then at the Séminaire de Québec before continuing his theological studies at the Pontifical Urbaniana University (then the University of the Propaganda), where he presented his D.D. thesis before Pope Leo XIII in June 1883. He had been ordained earlier that year, on March 24. Upon his return, he became a teacher of theology at Université Laval, an appointment he would keep until his death in 1942, one of the longest careers in the department. He would also along the course of his career, be dean of the Faculty of Theology (1904–1938) and Director of the Quebec Seminary (1902). He was made apostolic protonotary in 1902 and member of the Royal Society of Canada in 1903.
Encouraged by the pope to promote Neo-Scholasticism in Canada, he became one of the foremost proponents of the new philosophy, writing extensively on it and founding in 1930 the Académie canadienne Saint-Thomas d'Aquin, a philosophical organization devoted to the study of Saint Thomas Aquinas' writings. A prolific writer, he published in a number of venues from episcopal publications to newspapers, when he was not outright part of the direction board. As official interpreter of Papal pronouncements on questions interesting French Canada, he became very influential, pronouncing opinions on issues such as the Manitoba Schools Question (his first public intervention) and Ontario's Regulation 17. His 1902 speech, La Vocation de la race française en Amérique (""The Vocation of the French Race in America""), shaped French-Canadian nationalism around a missionary office for decades. Although the idea was already present in the writings of others, it was this speech that memorably crystallized it as a formal ideology and would be later cited as the text to refer to on the issue. In the same decade, he was an envoy of Louis-Nazaire Bégin to Rome, in 1906, where he would be an important element in the latter's rise to cardinalate. In 1909, he was charged with rewriting the schemata (decree proposals) resulting from the first Plenary Council of the Canadian Church.Paquet's Le Droit public de l'Église codified a lot of the French-Canadian catholic doctrine of the time, to the point that one commenter, Dominican Ceslas-Marie Forest, the dean of Université de Montréal's faculty of philosophy, described it as ""Sacro-saint"", ""untouchable"", ""integrist"" and ""reactionary""; amongst other things, it was the source of the major arguments against mandatory public education (which Paquet characterized as a Freemason plot). In 1907, he was amongst the founders of L'Action Catholique, a catholic newspaper that would reach its highest points under Maurice Duplessis. In its page, he would notably condemn Bolshevism, characterizing it as little more than anarchism. Although he voiced strong opinions (but in fact mostly echoed the prevalent conservative views of the French-Canadian clergy and elites of his time), Paquet had—unlike his uncle Benjamin—fairly little direct involvement in the religious politics of the period, a state that might have changed had the plan to counteract the Irish Catholic influence in Rome succeeded. The idea was to install him permanently in Rome with the Jesuits and have him named consultant to a few congregations, where he could acquire episcopal prestige. It is not known why that plan was never acted upon.Paquet's philosophy was characterised by some of the strictest ultramontane principles of the times (hence Forest's description of his Droit). He was one of the most vocal and noticeable opponent of women's voting rights in the 20s and 30s, and is even credited by some as a major agent of the strong social conservatism that would remain prevalent until the 50s; his influence nonetheless declined as public interest moved away from the religious to the social aspect of socio-religious issue, and his writing is considered of little interest in modern theological or social discussions beyond historic or historiographic considerations. A large collection of his papers, primarily from his career at Laval, are part of the Quebec Seminary archives. The Pâquet family domain is the major element of a local historic district, the Saint-Nicolas Heritage Site, as well as a historic monument.

The channel, available through cable and satellite distributors in the United States, produces a number of original series and documentaries with emphases in comedy, history, lifestyle, music and drama.  BYUtv also regularly broadcasts feature films, nature documentaries, acquired dramas and religious programs (consistent with the university's sponsoring organization, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints). Additionally, BYUtv Sports is the primary broadcaster of BYU Cougars athletics, producing more than 125 live sporting events in 2012 alone. The channel has won multiple regional Emmy Awards, a national Children's and Family Emmy Award, and several of its original series have been praised by national television critics.BYUtv broadcasts all of its original content, and most acquired content, worldwide online via its website. BYUtv is also carried through KBYU-TV, a television station in Provo, Utah, also owned by the university, ensuring HD coverage across Salt Lake City and most of Utah. The channel is one of several operated by the university's BYU Broadcasting division, including the world feed BYUtv Global and BYUradio.
Multiple celebrity guests and artists have made special appearances on BYUtv, notably Imagine Dragons and Neon Trees on the series AUDIO-FILES; Lea Salonga, Howard Jones, Duncan Sheik and Sixpence None the Richer on The Song That Changed My Life; and Shawn Bradley, The Piano Guys, and Mates of State on Studio C. Major athletes like Steve Young, Ty Detmer and Jimmer Fredette have also appeared on special BYUtv Sports broadcasts.


== History ==
BYUtv was founded in 2000, and has grown from a ""relatively unknown cable channel on a single satellite"" to a national provider on Dish Network, DirecTV, and over 600 cable systems in the US.During 2010 and 2011, newly appointed BYUtv director of content, Scott Swofford, commissioned focus groups targeting TV viewers who were at least nominally religious, to see what they liked, disliked and wanted on TV. Swofford summarized the results as, ""We want to be entertained. Then we'll stick around for the message."" This led to the creation of the pilot for Granite Flats, which became BYUtv's first and flagship original scripted television drama series, and went on to significantly expand the channel's audience, eventually attracting about 500,000 viewers per episode, compared to the previous top-rated show, Love of Quilting, which typically drew under 10,000.


== Programming ==
BYUtv produces shows under several categories: BYU Sports, Campus, Documentary, Faith, Family, Lifestyle, People, and Performing Arts. This includes original series, documentaries and religious service programs, along with family and faith-based films from several major studios.

=== BYU Sports ===
The channel was the primary home for most telecasts of BYU Cougars athletics, including select home and away games for football, men's and women's basketball, baseball, softball, gymnastics, men's and women's volleyball and women's soccer. Beginning in 2009, the network also began covering BYU-Hawaii Seasiders sports, including all conference home games in women's volleyball and men's basketball, as well as select conference home games in women's basketball and additional non-conference home games for men's basketball.
In 2011, BYUtv added the WCC Men's and Women's Basketball Tournaments to their sports broadcasts. BYUtv produced the first round and quarterfinals of the men's and women's basketball tournaments, which were also broadcast on ESPN3.com.In 2011, ESPN reached a deal to broadcast home games of the newly independent BYU Cougars football team.

Its coverage also included pre-game and post-game shows, with the pre-game show Countdown to Kickoff hosted by BYU Cougars alumni Alema Harrington, Dave McCann and a rotating panel of analysts: Gary Sheide, Blaine Fowler, David Nixon, Brian Logan, and Jan Jorgensen. In 2014, Spencer Linton replaced Harrington on the panel.
Additionally, the network launched a separate website for its sports coverage, Byutvsports.com, in partnership with ESPN and IMG College. The site features news, video and free video on demand streaming of recent games. The site folded back into byutv.org in fall 2015.

Nageswaraswamy Temple,"Nageswaraswamy Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva located in Kumbakonam in Thanjavur district, Tamil Nadu, India. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th-century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil poet saints known as the nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. The temple is counted as the earliest of all Chola temples. Shiva in the guise of Nagaraja, the serpent king..
There are many inscriptions associated with the temple indicating contributions from Cholas, Thanjavur Nayaks and Thanjavur Maratha kingdom. The oldest parts of the present masonry structure were built during the Chola dynasty in the 9th century, while later expansions, including the towering gopuram gatehouses, are attributed to later periods, up to the Thanjavur Nayaks during the 16th century.
The temple complex is one of the largest in the state and it houses three gateway towers known as gopurams. The temple has numerous shrines, with those of Nageswarar, Pralayamkathanathar and Periyanayagi being the most prominent. The temple complex houses many halls and three precincts; the most notable is the second precinct built during the Vijayanagar period that has many sculptures. The temple has six daily rituals at various times from 5:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., and twelve yearly festivals on its calendar. The temple is maintained and administered by Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu.


== Legend ==
During the time when Adisesha was feeling under the weight of the earth, he did penance at Kuvivanam. Parvathy appeared and blessed him at this place to get strength. The water body in the temple is called Naga Theertham. The temple known is for its shrine of Rahu, one of the nine celestial bodies in the Navagrahas. A legend has it that the mythological serpents Dakshan and Kaarkotakan worshipped Lord Shiva here. Legend also has it that King Nala worshipped Shiva here as in Thirunallar. There is a Naganathar temple at Tirunageswaram having similar features like temple. This place has been referred in Tevaram written by Saint Tamil poet of 7th Century AD, Thirugnana Sambanthar.


== History ==

Aditya Chola constructed this temple during the 9th century. It is great marvel of Chola architecture, building technology and astronomy. The orientation is structured in such a way that it allows sunlight inside the temple, right on the sanctum only during the Tamil month of Chithirai (April/May). It bears another name called Surya Kottam or Keezha Kottam. The Karuvarai (Sanctum Sanctorum) of Nageswaran temple is similar to Sarangapani Temple, as it is made in the form of a Chariot. The temple consists of three gopurams in the eastern, western and southern directions. The temple is designed in such a way that during the first three days of Tamil month Chittirai (April - May), the rays of the Sun falls directly in the base of the presiding deity in sanctum sanctorum.The temple had been a centre of learning as seen from the inscriptions in the temple. The inscriptions indicate specific subjects like Purvamimansa styled as Pravahakarma. There were also provisions made for feeding and maintaining for teachers and students. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu.


== Architecture ==

The temple is one of the prominent Shiva temples in Kumbakonam. The temple shows early Chola art in its best form particularly in the form of human figures. The sanctum is of padabandha-padmaka type stands on padmopana.  The lotus leaves of the padmopano are carved with vitality.  In its iconographic scheme the Ardhanari, Brahma and Dakshinamoorthy in the niches of the outer wall are featured.  The other sculptures on the walls almost life-size reflect either the donors to the temples or contemporary princesses and princes.  The epic scenes are in low relief on the plinth below the pilasters of the walls of the sanctum, recalling the wood work.The Devi shrine is an independent structure situated in the outer prakaram(outer precincts of a temple), detached from the axial unit, though it faces south, a feature common to Saiva Devin shrines.  The complex of Nataraja shrine is in the form of a chariot on wheel drawn by horses as in the case of Airavatesvara Temple at Darasuram and Sarangapani Temple in Kumbakonam. Similar architecture of halls (Mandapas) simulating a chariot drawn by elephant or horses is found in Sarangapani temple at Kumbakonam, Mela Kadambur Amirthakadeswarar Temple, Sikharagiriswara Temple, Kudumiyamalai, Vriddhagiriswarar Temple, Vriddhachalam and Thyagaraja Temple, Tiruvarur.According to historian Harle, the temple is counted among the four early extant temples of the Chola Empire, with the other three being Koranganatha Temple in Tiruchirappalli district, Moovar Koil in Pudukottai district, and Brahmapureeswarar temple in Thanjavur district. These temples follow the Pallava architecture which are relatively small in size. They all have a fair-sized porch, locally called ardhamandapa attached to the sanctum, both of which are slightly below the ground level in a pit kind of structure. The structures are also predominantly built of stone.During Rajendra Chola's Ganges expedition, the victorious chola army brought a beautiful Vinayagar statue as a war trophy to the chola empire. The Vinayagar statue was kept at this temple and was aptly named as Gangai Vinayagar. Currently, the Vinayagar is present in the ardha mandapam, in front of the sanctum of Nageswarar. The Vinayagar seems to be in the Pala style.


== Festivals and religious importance ==
The temple priests perform the puja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. Like other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Shaiva community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed five times a day; Ushathkalam at 6:30 a.m., Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 5:00 p.m., and Ardha Jamam at 8:00 p.m. Each ritual comprises four steps: abhisheka (sacred bath), alangaram (decoration), naivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Nageswarar and Periyanayagi. The worship is held amidst music with nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument), religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred texts) read by priests and prostration by worshipers in front of the temple mast. There are weekly rituals like somavaram (Monday) and sukravaram (Friday), fortnightly rituals like pradosham and monthly festivals like amavasai (new moon day), kiruthigai, pournami (full moon day) and sathurthi. Mahashivaratri during February - March is the major festivals celebrated in the temple. The major festival of the temple is the Brahmotsavam temple during Tamil month of Panguni when the Sun's rays fall directly on the image in the sanctum.


== Religious importance ==
Tirugnana Sambandar, a 7th-century Tamil Saivite poet, venerated Nageswarar in ten padigams in Tevaram, compiled as the First Tirumurai and second Tirumuari. Appar, a contemporary of Sambandar, also venerated Nageswarar in 12 padigams in Tevaram, compiled in the Fourth, fifth and sixth Tirumurai. Sundarar, the 8th century Nayanmar revered Nageswarar in seven padigams, which is compiled in Seventh Tirumuari. As the temple is revered in Tevaram, it is classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam, one of the 275 temples that find mention in the Saiva canon. The temple is counted as the 52nd in the list of temples in the northern banks of Cauvery. The temple is counted as one of the temples built on the banks of River Kaveri. The Sun rays falling on the image of Shiva is considered as the worship of Surya.As per a Hindu belief, people troubled by Sarpa-dosha or Malefic effects Rahu-Kethu seek a relief by offering prayers in a single day to Kudanthai or Kumbakonam Nageshwarar in the morning, Thirunageshwaram Naganathar at the noon, Thirupamburam Pambureswarar in the evening and Nagoor Nageshwarar or Naganathar temple at night.


== Specialty ==

Magelhaens (lunar crater),"Magelhaens is a lunar impact crater that lies along the southwestern edge of the Mare Fecunditatis, in the eastern part of the Moon's near side. It was named after 16th-century Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan. It lies to the south-southwest of the crater Goclenius, about midway between Gutenberg to the northwest and Colombo to the southeast.
This crater has a somewhat slender and uneven outer rim that is only roughly circular. The slightly smaller satellite crater Magelhaens A is attached to the southeastern rim. Within the inner walls of Magelhaens, the interior floor has been resurfaced by basaltic lava, matching the same dark appearance as the lunar mare to the northeast. This floor is level and almost featureless.

She then attend Louisville Municipal College (LMC), which later merged with the University of Louisville during desegregation, and majored in accounting.  Jones graduated third in her class. She attended the University of Louisville Law School for one year, transferring to Howard University School of Law for her degree, graduating fourth in her class in 1959. During her time at Howard University, Jones served on the staff of the Howard Law journal and worked as a student counselor. Upon graduating, she had several interviews in Washington and Senator John Sherman Cooper offered his office as a study space for the bar exam.


== Career and activism ==
In 1959, upon admission to the Kentucky bar the same year she received her law degree, Jones became Kentucky's first practicing African American female attorney. The day after receiving the notification that she had passed the bar, Jones had already accepted her first case. As she explained to the Courier Journal, ""This girl I know asked me four years ago - when she separated from her husband - to handle her divorce. I promised I would if I made the grade.""In 1960, She eventually took on a prominent client early in her career, a young boxer who later changed his name from Cassius Clay to Muhammed Ali, introducing him to trainer Archie Moore of California. She was appointed in February 1965 to the Louisville Domestic Relations Court, where she was a prosecutor.


=== Activism ===
Jones was active in the civil rights movement, taking part in protest marches in Louisville and attending the March on Washington in August 1963. Upon returning from Washington she formed the Independent Voters Association of Louisville and was very involved with the Louisville chapter of the Urban League. She rented voting machines and taught African Americans how to use the machines to vote. She was also active in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Another of her causes was a fundraising effort to pay the medical bills of a young man, James ""Bulky"" Welch, who lost his arms saving his dog trapped under a train, purchasing him prosthetic arms by auctioning a car.


== Unsolved murder ==
On August 5, 1965, Jones was murdered. Her killing was first attributed to drowning and her body was retrieved from the Ohio River. However, her car was found several blocks from the Sherman Minton Bridge with blood inside and a subsequent autopsy determined that she had been subjected to several severe blows to the head before entering the water.Jones' murder was one of six unsolved murders in the area that year. On September 28, 1965, a Courier Journal headline declared ""300 Interviewed in Jones Murder"" and the article announced Police Chief William E. Bindner's plan to increase of police patrols in Louisville's West End. The investigation determined that she had been beaten unconscious with a brick and witnesses recalled seeing a body tossed by three unidentified men from the bridge, where her purse was later found.In 2017, efforts were made to reopen the Jones case and it became a cause célèbre. Detectives involved in the initial investigation were interviewed in the hope that new leads had surfaced over the 52 years since the killing. Professor and attorney Lee Remington, who was doing research for a biography, found clues to the murder and sent a letter to the Louisville police, who agreed to reopen the case. The civil rights division of the Department of Justice also began an investigation. The investigation is funded by a new law, the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act, which provides $13.5 million annual funds to the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and state and local law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute pre-1970 killings. Her killing remains unsolved.


== Legacy ==
In October, 2022, Louisville Central High School presented the first ever Alberta O. Jones award to Laura Rothstein, a retired University of Louisville law professor who helped start the high school's law and government magnet program. The award, which may not be given annually, is said to be intended for ""those who have worked as hard as Jones to make their community a better place.""

Little Beard's Town,"Little Beard's Town, also known as Chenussio (in Seneca) and ""Genesee Castle"", was a powerful Seneca town in the Genesee River Valley near modern Leicester in Livingston County, New York, where Cuylerville stands today.
It surrounded the area that is now Rt. 39, between Geneseo and Cuylerville, New York.  At the time of its destruction by Sullivan, the town was located on the west side of the Genesee River.  Ten years prior, it had been on the east side of the river, as the Seneca villages were generally moved approximately every 10 years.The town was named after its founder, Little Beard, a prominent Seneca sachem in the late 18th century. It was famous for its beautiful surroundings and the productivity of its vegetable gardens, fruit orchards, and fields of corn. It had about 130 houses-- ""finely built log cabins with ample furnishings; some even had glass window panes,"" as well as a large council building, built around a central square. It was located near three other Seneca towns, all of which were destroyed during the Sullivan Expedition in the American Revolutionary War.
The Seneca and three other Iroquois nations fought on the British side during the American Revolutionary War.  Little Beard and his warriors participated in the Cherry Valley massacre and the Boyd and Parker ambush, in which two soldiers were brought to Little Beard's Town and tortured. Subsequently, troops of the Continental Army under Major General John Sullivan attacked Little Beard's Town and other Iroquois settlements in the Genesee and Mohawk valleys, destroying buildings and crops. The residents had to flee.
""Little Beard's Town was burnt by Sullivan-Clinton’s forces on Sept. 14-15, 1779.""One famous resident fled with the Seneca to more secure villages, around Niagara Falls, with three children. This was Mary Jemison, a Scots-Irish immigrant colonist who had been captured by the Seneca at age 15 with her family, most of whom were killed.  She was adopted and married into the tribe, and lived with them all her life.A fictional account of the burning of the town is given in The Scouts of the Valley by Joseph A. Altsheler.""The Men in Sullivans Army were so greatly impressed by the 22 inch long ears of corn, the fine vegetable gardens and the fruit orchards that many determined to return and settle on this land after the war."" The site was reserved as a Seneca reservation in the 1797 Treaty of Big Tree, along with five other parcels on the Genesee River; they sold those parcels to the Ogden Land Company in 1826, a sale that the modern Seneca Nation of Indians does not recognize as valid.In 2004, the 225th Anniversary of the Groveland Ambuscade and the Boyd-Parker Massacre, local historical societies set up a civilian camp for re-enactors at the site of Little Beard’s Town.

Acacia urophylla,"Acacia urophylla, commonly known as pointed leaved acacia, tall-leaved acacia, veined wattle or net-leaved wattle, is a shrub of the genus Acacia and the subgenus Phyllodineae endemic to Western Australia.


== Description ==
The erect slender and open shrub typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 metres (3 to 10 ft). The prominently yellow-ribbed branchlets have pungent and hardened stipules with a length of 2 to 8 millimetres (0.079 to 0.315 in). The thin evergreen phyllodes have an obliquely lanceolate to ovate shape and are usually 5 to 11 centimetres (2.0 to 4.3 in) in length with a width of 1 to 4 cm (0.39 to 1.57 in). They are narrowed at base and have two to four prominent longitudinal nerves on the face. It blooms from May to October and produces cream-yellow flowers. The inflorescences occur as two to five headed racemes, usually with two on each node. The flower heads have a spherical shape and contain 8 to 12 loosely bunched pale yellow or white flowers. After flowering black sub-woody seed pods with a twisted narrowly linear shape that are around 14 cm (5.5 in) in length and 2 to 4 mm (0.079 to 0.157 in) wide. Each pod contains severalglossy dark brown seeds with an oblong to elliptic shape and a length of 3 to 4 mm (0.118 to 0.157 in).The shrub is dieback resistant.


== Taxonomy ==
The species was first formally described by George Bentham in 1841 as part of John Lindley's work Edwards's Botanical Register. It was reclassified in 2003 by Leslie Pedley as Racosperma urophyllum and transferred back into the genus Acacia in 2006. Other synonyms include; Acacia smilacifolia, Acacia smilacifolia var. glaberrima, Acacia smilacifolia var. smilacifolia, Acacia urophylla var. glaberrima and Acacia urophylla var. urophylla.The specific epithet for this species is taken from the Greek words  uro- meaning elongated appendage and phylla meaning leaves referring to the shape of the leaves.A. urophylla belongs to the Acacia myrtifolia group as a result of the flower structure and is most closely related to Acacia scalpelliformis.


== Distribution ==
It is native to an area in from the south of New Norcia in the Wheatbelt, extending south through the Peel and South West to around Augusta and then east to around Walpole in the Great Southern region of Western Australia where it is found in along watercourses and other damp locations growing in lateritic soils. In southwestern areas it is commonly part of the understorey in the Eucalyptus diversicolor forests and can form dense stands after bushfires following fire. In the north it is found less frequently and occurs as disjunct populations along creeks in Eucalyptus marginata forest and woodland communities.


== Cultivation ==
The species is available commercially in seed form. The seeds need to be pre-treated with boiling water or scarified prior to planting. It is used for the rehabilitation of disturbed sites within its native range.

Johann Christian Senckenberg,"Johann Christian Senckenberg (28 February 1707 – 15 November 1772)  was a German physician, naturalist and collector. In 1763, he established the Senckenberg Foundation to support natural sciences. This founded the Botanischer Garten der Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universitat Frankfurt am Main. His name is honoured in the Senckenberg Gesellschaft für Naturforschung (Senckenberg Natural History Society) which he endowed, Frankfurt University Library, and Naturmuseum Senckenberg.


== Life ==
Senckenberg was born on 28 February 1707 in Frankfurt am Main. He was the second oldest son of the Frankfurt city physicus (Physikus primarius, medical officer) Johann Hartmann Senckenberg (1655–1730) and his second wife Anna Margaretha born Raumburger (1682–1740). He attended the municipal school in the former Franciscan mendicant in 1719. When Senckenberg was twelve years old, Senckenberg House was burned down in the Großer Christenbrand, which was the worst fire disaster in Frankfurt until the Second World War. The reconstruction of the house brought the family into financial difficulties. Although Senckenberg was granted a 100 guilders scholarship through the city four years later, his studies were delayed due to the financial situation.
In the meantime, Senckenberg worked as an intern lead doctor (Leitarzt) with the Solms noble family and with Frankfurt doctors Büttner and Grambs. His father instructed him in practical medicine. In 1730 he was able to study medicine at the University of Halle. His teachers in Halle included Friedrich Hoffmann and Georg Ernst Stahl. In July 1731 he had to stop studying in Halle. The deeply religious Senckenberg was impressed by the theologian Johann Konrad Dippel and became involved in theological arguments and refused Eucharist. He had turned away from the state church and was in contact with pietists, inspirational communities and members of the Moravian Church (Herrnhutern). In Halle, he encountered the charitable institutions of August Hermann Francke, including an orphanage and a hospital.
Senckenberg returned to Frankfurt in the spring of 1732 and practised medicine there without a license. After he had suffered from mental problems, his older brother Heinrich Christian Senckenberg helped him in 1737 to obtain his doctorate at the Georg August University of Göttingen. Under the chairmanship of Albrecht von Haller, he dealt in his dissertation with the healing power of the Lily of the valley (De lilii convallium eiusque inprimis Baccae viribus.: ""On the healing power of the berries of the Lily of the valley""). In the following years, Senckenberg became involved as ""Physicus extraordinarius"", from 1755 as ""Physicus ordinarius"" for the health service in Frankfurt.

After the death of his mother in 1740, Senckenberg married the jeweller's daughter (Joh-)Anna Rebecca Riese in 1742. In the same year he resigned the Bürgerid. The two had been neighbours as children and had known each other ever since. On 26 October 1743, Riese died of childbed fever following the birth of their daughter. The daughter Anna Margarethe Senckenberg died in 1745 from meningitis. Senckenberg remarried in 1744. His second wife, Katharina Rebecca von Mettingh, had been a friend of Senckenberg's first wife. She died in 1747, as did a son that was born in June 1747 (tuberculosis). In 1752, Senckenberg had a portrait painted of his cat. In 1754, Senckenberg married a third time. However, the marriage with Antonetta Elisabetha Ruprecht was not good, and from 1756 they lived separately. Ruprecht suffered from cancer. Senckenberg also treated her after the separation, but she died in late 1756.
After the death of his three wives and his children, he decided to make his entire fortune available in a Foundation pro bono publico patriae. Senckenberg called the reason for the Foundation the ""lack of marital heirs"" and his love ""for my fatherland"". The purpose of the Foundation should be the ""better health care of local residents and the care of the poor."" The endowment of 95,000 guilders came partly the legacy of Anna Rebecca, and partly from the fortune he had earned as a doctor.
Senckenberg stated that a ""Collegium medicum"" comprising Frankfurt Protestant physicians were the heirs of the Foundation's assets, and that four city doctors were to be testament executors. Two-thirds of the interest on the Foundation's capital was to be used to promote medicine, although initially it was to be used for the entertainment of the Senckenbergische Wohnhaus, which was equipped with a library and a collection. The remaining third should be used to care for needy doctors and patients. In 1765, Senckenberg increased the Foundation assets to 100,000 guilders. He strongly limited the board of trustees and gave his older brother and his descendants a say in the Foundation's administration. The Foundation became called Senckenbergische Stiftung and took as seal the coat of arms of the Senckenberg family: a burning bush.
Senckenberg already had plans to build a building on the outskirts with garden, laboratory, botanical garden and greenhouse. In 1766, Senckenberg acquired a three-hectare plot of land at Eschenheimer Tor for 23,000 guilders. From 1767 the building became the foundation seat and residential building of Senckenberg. On 9 July 1771, Senckenberg laid the foundation stone for the Frankfurt Bürgerhospital. During an inspection of the building on 15 November 1772, Senckenberg crashed down from the scaffolding of the dome of the hospital and died. On 17 November, he was publicly dissected in the ""Theatrum anatomicum"" donated by him, even though he had refused a dissection in the will. The cause of death was a cervical spine fracture with ascending bleeding in the spinal canal. Senckenberg's nephew, Renatus Karl von Senckenberg, noted in a report on Senckenberg; ""All of Frankfurt regretted his loss"".  On 18 November 1772, Frankfurt surgeons accompanied by Renatus of the Senckenberg Foundation, as well as administration and other mourners, carried the coffin to the Senckenberg tomb at Stiftsgebäude monastery.
Senckenberg kept diaries during his studies. A total of 53 diary volumes and 600 folders with further notes are now in the Frankfurt University Johann Christian Senckenberg Library. There are 40,000 pages in total. Due to the hard-to-read handwriting (a mixture of Frankfurt German, Latin, Greek, French and English), as well as numerous idiosyncratic abbreviations, reading and transcribing these diaries is very difficult. Since 2011, Frankfurt University Library has been working on bringing some 13,000 diary pages from the years 1730 to 1742 into a readable form and making them available online as digital copies.

== Regular season ==
The Orioles hosted the 1993 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. It was the 64th playing of the midsummer classic between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and National League (NL) at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. The game resulted in the American League defeating the National League 9–3. Orioles pitcher Mike Mussina was voted onto the All-Star team, but did not pitch in the game due to his injury.
There was a controversial incident towards the end of the game when Mussina chose to warm-up in the bullpen, despite the fact AL manager Cito Gaston had told him prior to the game that he would not pitch during the contest because of his injury issues and in case the game went into extra innings. Orioles fans believed Mussina was warming up in preparation to come in and pitch the ninth inning and when Gaston put Duane Ward in to pitch the ninth inning, the fans at Camden Yards spent the rest of the game booing Gaston very loudly and many chanted the popular slogan saying ""Cito Sucks"" which could be heard years later in Baltimore anytime Baltimore played Toronto. Gaston was never treated well by Baltimore fans for the rest of his managerial career and he was subject to death threats for not pitching Mussina in the game. Many believe Mussina threw on his own as a way of publicly showing up Gaston because he was angry at not pitching in the game.

Debora LMP295,"The Debora LMP295 and Debora LMP201 were Le Mans Prototypes built by Debora in 1995 for the 24 Hours of Le Mans. One of each type was built, and both cars featured the same 2-litre Cosworth-Ford turbocharged straight-four engine. Both cars were only entered in the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans, whilst the LMP295 took Didier Bonnet Racing's best ever result in the race.


== Racing history ==
Debora built two separate cars for the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans; the LMP295, and the LMP201. Both cars used the same 2-litre Cosworth-Ford turbocharged straight-four engine, and both were run by Didier Bonnet Racing. The LMP295 chassis was designated #LMP295-01, whilst the LMP201 chassis was designated as the #LMP295-02. Both cars made their public debut in the Pre-qualifying session for the 24 Hours of Le Mans; the LMP201 was driven by Didier Bonnet and Bernard Santal, and was prequalified in 26th place, whilst the LMP295 was tested, but not used to pre-qualify with. However, the LMP201 was not listed as having pre-qualified, so Didier Bonnet Racing used the LMP295 instead, and entered Santal, Patrice Roussel and Edouard Sezionale in the car; they finished twentieth, and last, having completed 223 laps, but were the only LMP2 car to finish the race, and won the LMP2 class as a result. This would be Didier Bonnet Racing's best ever finish at the event. Neither the LMP201, nor the LMP295 were used again, as Debora built the new LMP296 for 1996.

A controversial moment occurred near the end of the game when Chicago thought they had leveled the score by Gonzalo Segaras, but referee Terry Vaughn disallowed it as assistant referee George Gerner rules Segaras was offside, leading to the sending off of Fire player Andy Herron for abusive language and a scuffle after the final whistle blew at midfield.

Jardin d'Acclimatation railway,"The Jardin d'Acclimatation railway is a 500 mm (19+3⁄4 in) minimum gauge park railway, located in the Bois de Boulogne in Paris. It was opened in 1878 and connects Porte Maillot and the Jardin d'Acclimatation (zoological gardens), 800 meters apart. It was the first passenger-carrying narrow gauge railway of France.


== History ==
The French narrow gauge railway pioneer Paul Decauville wanted to experiment with passenger transport using his portable railways, already successfully introduced in the industry and agriculture. For the 1878 Exposition Universelle he proposed to use his concept for the exhibition by a line Trocadéro - Military Academy passing the Champ-de-Mars, but permission was denied. He then offered the same facility at the Zoological Gardens, which was accepted. Two kilometers of railway line at the track gauge of 500 mm (19+3⁄4 in) was constructed for the transportation of the exhibit visitors over a circular track, having a maximum speed of 15 km/h. The line carried up to 3000 passengers on some Sundays and received a very positive response from the visitors. But for some unknown reason, the network was quickly removed.
In 1880, a new modified line connected the garden to the Porte Maillot. It was constructed by another company and operated as a streetcar line with American vehicles hauled by ponies. These gave way to tractors in 1910. By 1930, the line was shortened at each end. Since then, it continues to link Porte Maillot to the garden, without being altered significantly since then.


== The line ==
The line originally featured a terminus loop at Porte Maillot, crossing the road at the Porte de Sablons, and follows a route through the woods to the garden, which is traversed for its entire length. It was constructed in double track with each track following a slightly different alignment, with a total track length of five kilometers. Curves had a minimum radius of eight to fifteen meters .
In the early 1930s, the line was shortened at both ends. The section within the zoological garden was removed, and the road section to Porte Maillot, where an underground construction was created, required relocating of the terminal along the road at Porte des Sablons.


== Operations ==
Originally, two ponies hauled one or two carriages. Each carriage had eight seats, with passengers sitting back to back on longitudinal seats. In 1901 American newspapers reported that the train was pulled by a locomotive which resembled ""a cross between a great Chinese dragon and a sea serpent."" Each carriages of the train ""formed a joint of the creature's sinuous body"" and the seats were ""along the sides - back to back."" In 1910, a driver's cab was added at the rear of the locomotive. Trains were made up of three to four carriagess equipped with crossbenches facing the direction of travel. The appearance of the locomotives has evolved over the years with one resembling Renault taxis, while another retained a more classic look .
In 1945, due to the shortage of gasoline, the gasoline locomotives were replaced with battery-electric road tractors, which probably came from the Universal Exhibition of 1937, with their wheels with tires running outside the rails. The gasoline locomotives were quickly returned to service. In 1960, Renault built seven locomotives with two bogies. Their bodywork was steam outline and brightly decorated. These machines are 3.05 metres (10.0 ft) long and 1.20 metres (3 ft 11 in) wide, weigh five tons and reach 19 kilometres per hour (12 mph). They have 55 horsepower (41 kW) engines. The carriages are those of the 1910s, the only modification being the addition of a small roof in the year 1951. In 2010 new electric locomotives came into service on the railway.

Patria disaster,"The Patria disaster was the sinking on 25 November 1940 by the Jewish paramilitary organization Haganah of a French-built ocean liner, the 11,885-ton SS Patria, in the port of Haifa, killing 267 people and injuring 172.At the time of the sinking, Patria was carrying about 1,800 Jewish refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe whom the British authorities were deporting from Mandatory Palestine to Mauritius because they lacked entry permits. Zionist organizations opposed the deportation, and the underground paramilitary Haganah group planted a bomb intended to disable the ship to prevent it from leaving Haifa.
The Haganah claims to have miscalculated the effects of the explosion. The bomb blew the steel frame off one full side of the ship and the ship sank in less than 16 minutes, trapping hundreds in the hold. The British allowed the survivors to remain in Palestine on humanitarian grounds. Who was responsible and the true reason why Patria sank remained controversial mysteries until 1957, when Munya Mardor, the person who planted the bomb, published a book about his experiences.


== Background ==
Before the government of Nazi Germany decided in 1941 to exterminate all Jews in Europe, its policy allowed the reduction of Jewish numbers in Europe by emigration. Jewish organizations, both mainstream and dissident, ran operations that tried to bring Jews from Europe to Palestine in violation of the immigration rules applied by the British government.
This required cooperation with the Nazi authorities, who saw the opportunity to make trouble for Britain as well as to get rid of Jews. The Zentralstelle für jüdische Auswanderung (Central Office for Jewish Emigration or ZjA) worked under the supervision of Adolf Eichmann, organizing Jewish emigration from the Nazi-controlled parts of Europe. In September 1940 the ZjA chartered three ships, SS Pacific, SS Milos and SS Atlantic, to take Jewish refugees from the Romanian port of Tulcea to Palestine. Their passengers consisted of about 3,600 refugees from the Jewish communities of Vienna, Danzig and Prague.Pacific reached Palestinian waters on 1 November, followed by Milos a few days later. The Royal Navy intercepted the ships and escorted them to the port of Haifa. Warned in advance of the ships' arrival, the British Colonial Office was determined to refuse entry to the immigrants. With the security situation in the region improving following British successes in the Western Desert Campaign, the Colonial Office decided it was less risky to provoke Jewish anger than to risk an Arab revolt, and that an example would be made to dissuade other potential immigrants from making the attempt.The British High Commissioner for Palestine, Sir Harold MacMichael, issued a deportation order on 20 November, ordering that the refugees be taken to the British Indian Ocean territory of Mauritius and the Caribbean territory of Trinidad.The refugees were transferred to another ship, SS Patria, for the voyage to Mauritius. Patria was an 11,885-ton ocean liner dating from 1913 that the French company Messageries Maritimes ran between Marseille and the Levant. She had reached the Port of Haifa shortly before Italy declared war on France and Britain, and then remained in port for safety. After the French surrender to Nazi Germany the British authorities in Haifa first detained Patria and then seized her for use as a troop ship. As a civilian liner she was permitted to carry 805 people including her crew, but after being requisitioned she was authorised to carry 1,800 troops (excluding the crew). She still only had enough lifeboats for the original 805 passengers and crew, so these were supplemented with liferafts.The refugees from Pacific and Milos were soon transferred to Patria. Atlantic arrived on 24 November and the transfer of eight hundred of its 1,645 passengers began.


== Bombing ==
Meanwhile, Zionist organizations were considering how to thwart the deportation plan. A general strike had little effect. The Irgun tried unsuccessfully to place a bomb on Patria to disable her. The Haganah also sought to disable Patria, with the intention of forcing her to stay in port for repairs and thus gaining time to press the British to rescind the deportation order. The Haganah officer in charge of the operation was Yitzhak Sadeh, authorised by Moshe Sharett, who led the Political Department of the Jewish Agency in the temporary absence of David Ben-Gurion, who had left for the United States on 22 September and did not return until 13 February 1941.On 22 November Haganah agents smuggled a 2-kilogram (4.4 lb) bomb aboard the ship, timed to explode at 9 p.m. that day. It failed, so a second, more powerful bomb was smuggled aboard on 24 November and hidden next to the ship's inner hull. At 9 a.m. on 25 November, it exploded. The Haganah had miscalculated the effect of the charge and it blew a large hole measuring 3 by 2 metres (9.8 ft × 6.6 ft) in the ship's side, sinking her in only 16 minutes.When the bomb exploded, Patria was carrying 1,770 refugees transferred from Pacific and Milos and had taken on board 134 passengers from Atlantic. Most were rescued by British and Arab boats that rushed to the scene. However, 267 people were declared missing – over 200 Jewish refugees plus 50 crew and British soldiers – and another 172 were injured. Many of the dead were trapped in Patria's hold and were unable to escape as she rolled on her side and sank. 209 bodies were eventually recovered and buried in Haifa.


== Aftermath ==
The surviving refugees from Patria, together with the remaining 1,560 passengers of Atlantic, were taken to the Atlit detainee camp.  Later, after an international campaign, the survivors of Patria were given permits to stay in Palestine. However, the other Atlantic passengers were deported to Mauritius on 9 December. After the war they were given the choice of where to go; 81% chose Palestine and arrived there in August 1945.In December 1945 Ha-Po'el ha-Tza'ir (""Young Worker"") a Mapai party newspaper, commented ""On one bitter and impetuous day, a malicious hand sank the ship"". The comment was written by the deputy editor, Israel Cohen, who did not know that all of the people responsible were Mapai leaders. Angered by the newspaper's comments, some Haganah leaders sent Ben-Gurion's son Amos to the newspaper office where he slapped the editor, Isaac Lofven, across the face.
A bitter debate over the correctness of the operation raged in secret within the Zionist leadership. The decision had been made by an activist faction, without consulting more moderate members according to normal procedure, and this caused serious internal divisions that persisted for many years. An effort was made to enshrine the incident as an icon of Zionist determination, but this largely failed. As early as 15 December 1945 Isaac Lofven warned a Mapai meeting against trying to ""sanctify"" the tragedy.Some leaders of the Yishuv (the Jewish community in Palestine) argued that the loss of life had not been in vain, as Patria's survivors had been allowed to stay in the country. Others declared that the Haganah had had no right to risk the lives of the immigrants, as they had not decided of their own free will to become participants in the underground Jewish conflict with the British authorities.The Haganah's role was not publicly revealed and a story was put out that the deportees, out of despair, had sunk the ship themselves (the version recounted, for example, by Arthur Koestler). For years Britain believed the Irgun was probably responsible.
The Haganah's role was finally publicly disclosed in 1957 when Munya Mardor, the operative who had planted the bomb, wrote an account of his activities in the Jewish underground.  He recounted, ""There was never any intent to cause the ship to sink. The British would have used this against the Jewish population and show it as an act of sabotage against the war effort"". He said that it was in the highest interest of the Haganah to fight the sanctions of the British White Paper of 1939, and the primary objective was to avoid casualties. The British estimated 267 people were killed, but neither the Jewish Agency nor the Haganah could establish how many people escaped the sinking and how many had died.Munya Mardor continued to work at the port in order to remove suspicion from himself. The Haganah also put up an investigative body to find out why such a relatively small amount of explosives could create such a large hole in the ship. The Haganah investigators concluded that the boat's superstructure was in poor condition, and therefore unable to withstand the pressure of the explosion.Rudolf Hirsch, a Jewish-German writer who had emigrated to Palestine in 1939, was a close associate of Arnold Zweig there, and later remigrated with Zweig to East Germany, published a novel about the incident, Patria Israel, in which he also explicitly refers to Mardor's account.

Blue Marsh Lake,"Blue Marsh Lake is an artificial lake located northwest of the city of Reading, Pennsylvania, USA and managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Philadelphia District. It is in western Berks County, fed into by the Tulpehocken Creek. The main span of the lake is along the border between Bern and Lower Heidelberg Townships. However, the northwesternmost portions lie in the more sparsely populated North Heidelberg and Penn Townships. In the middle of the lake is a large, uninhabited island (claimed by Bern Township). The lake is a popular recreation area in the summer, where people can fish, swim, and boat. It has 36 miles of trails and 1,147 acres of water. It was built and is operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Philadelphia District.


== History ==
Blue Marsh was the name of the village that was located where the lake now is, and locals called the area Pleasant Valley. It was the first settlement in Lower Heidelberg Township. The land was very fertile. It was also a heavily forested area with abundance of wildlife. There were many farms and 18th and 19th century homes. The village also had a church, schoolhouse, post office, and Pyles General Store. Some buildings were spared, such as Gruber Wagon Works, which was originally in Obold village (present day Mt. Pleasant) but was moved a safe distance away before the dam was created. Others include Old Dry Rd. Farm, which most of its buildings were relocated out of the village. Residents were put under eminent domain and had no choice but to move out. Initial authorization for the reservoir was granted by the Flood Control Act of 1962 that started eight projects on the Delaware River basin.  The Pennsylvania Project 70 Land Acquisition and Borrowing Act provided funding and permitted the eminent domain acquisition of the land that would later become the lake with the governor's permission in 1969.  The United States Army Corps of Engineers began constructing the lake in March 1974 with the impoundment of the Tulpehocken Creek and was completed in September 1979.

Ship watching,"Ship watching is a form of outdoor activity and tourism that is carried out worldwide by observing the passage of various ships in the waterways where there is a lot of ship traffic.In the United States, for example, ship watching is practised in Two Harbors, Minnesota, over Lake Superior, while in Japan, it is done on the ships that pass through the Uraga Channel at Kannonzaki Park, Kanagawa, Japan. In China, as many ships go up and down the Changjiang, River Bank Parks (Chinese: 江滩公园) in Hankou and in Wuchang, in the city of Wuhan, are good places to enjoy ship watching.

Pomathorn Halt railway station,"Pomathorn Halt railway station served the town of Penicuik, Midlothian, Scotland from 1855 to 1962 on the Peebles Railway.


== History ==
The station opened on 4 July 1855 by the Peebles Railway. The station was situated on the north side of the B6372. The station was originally called Penicuik, but it was renamed Pomathorn on 2 December 1872, although the station signs always called it 'Pomathorn for Penicuik'. The goods yard was accessed from the north and consisted of three sidings, two of which served a cattle dock. The station was downgraded to an unstaffed halt on 1 November 1946 and the suffix 'halt' was added to its name on 7 July 1947,  although it didn't appear on tickets or signs, just the timetables. 
Following the closure of Penicuik station in September 1951 - terminus of the Penicuik railway, half a mile nearer the centre of town - Pomarthorn became Penicuik's only station. It closed to passengers and goods traffic on 5 February 1962.

Hindmarsh Fire and Folk Museum,"The Hindmarsh Fire and Folk Museum is a history museum housed in a former fire station in Hindmarsh, South Australia.
It includes historical fire equipment and other artifacts from the former Hindmarsh Fire Brigade, dating back to the 1880s.The building was a fire station from 1890 to 1925. According to the South Australia heritage register or whatever, ""The congregation of the former Christian Chapel traced its roots to a small band of Christians, for a time presided over by Pastor Thomas Playford, patriarch of the Playford family, who erected a non-denominational Christian Chapel fronting Lindsay Circus (site of the soccer stadium) c.1845. The chapel was altered, possibly in the 1850s, but may incorporate parts of the original building. It was superseded by a new church across the street in 1876. While the building has been substantially altered it has important historical ties to the founding years of Hindmarsh village. The building was subsequently used as a school and meeting hall and by the Hindmarsh Volunteer Fire Brigade from 1890 to 1925, when they moved into a new building in front of it. The Metropolitan Fire Brigade used the buildings 1942-1957. The Hindmarsh Historical Society has occupied the site since 1969. The chapel is of most significance for its religious links with a relatively rare type of congregation and for dating from the earliest years of the Colony's first (1838) secondary town. Its siting on Lindsay Circus, intended to be the focus of the early village, is also significant. As at 1997, this building and its successor across the road are the only non-denominational chapels that are State Heritage Places. The 1925 Fire Brigade building is notable for its association with the State's longest serving volunteer fire brigade.""It has also been known as Hindmarsh Historical Society Museum.

Kagi Shrine,"Kagi Shrine (Japanese: 嘉義神社, Hepburn: Kagi jinja) was a Shinto shrine located in previously Soa-a-teng (Chinese: 山仔頂; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Soaⁿ-á-téng), Kagi City, Tainan Prefecture, Japanese Taiwan (modern-day Chiayi Park, Chiayi City, Taiwan).
The shrine was built on 28 October 1915 (Taishō 4) facing south but later altered in 1942 (Shōwa 17) to face west. The shrine was originally categorized as a prefectural shrine in 1917 (Taishō 6) but elevated to rank of small shrine (国幣小社, kokuhei-shōsha) in 1944 (Shōwa 19). Prince Yoshihisa, Ōkunitama no Mikoto (大国魂命), Ōnamuchi no Mikoto, Sukunahikona no Mikoto (少彦名命) and Amaterasu were enshrined as deities.
The honden (main hall) was turned into a  martyrs' shrine by the Republic of China government after World War II but was destroyed in a fire on 24 April 1994. The main office and purification hall now serve as the Chiayi City Historical Relics Museum.
In 1998 the Chiayi Tower was built in place of the main hall, the design was inspired by an indigenous mythological tale about the creator of the world. In Chinese the tower is called Sun-Shooting Tower and houses an observation deck.
The existing main office (社務所, shamusho) and purification hall (斎館, saikan) are wooden structures built in the classical Japanese Shoin-zukuri architectural style and underwent repair work before being opened to the general public on 5 January 2001 as the Chiayi City Historical Relics Museum. The area became part of Chiayi Park and the temizuya (purification pavilion), sandō (pathway), stone tōrō lantern, and Komainu statues amongst other things still exist today.

Paglieri,"Paglieri is an Italian consumer goods company specializing in personal care, home care, and fragrances founded by Luigi Paglieri in Alessandria, Italy. In 2001, the company founded Selectiva Spa, with the brands Aquolina, Pink Sugar, and, since 2010, has owned Schiaparelli Farmaceutici and Agopag, since December 2022.


== History ==
In 1807, Luigi Paglieri opened a shop in Alessandria, in what was then Via Ravanale (currently Via Mazzini). In 1830, the shop was transferred to Piazza Vittorio Emanuele (now Piazza Libertà), in a much more favorable position. The commercial function was also added to the production one, as the production of creams, powders, rouges, and wigs on an artisanal scale began in the back shop.The company Paglieri was founded in 1876 by Luigi Paglieri and his son Lodovico in Alessandria, Italy. Starting as a small family-run business, Paglieri initially focused on the production of traditional Italian perfumes and cosmetics.
In the early 1900s Luigi Paglieri, son of Lodovico, had Palazzo Paglieri built, the first in reinforced concrete in that city and the first to have an elevator. It housed the Paglieri family and in the 1930s he opened the factory here. In the 1920s, mass production of perfumes and colognes began. In 1923, the Felce Azzurra Eau de Cologne was released, and in 1926 — the Felce Azzurra talc.The same years saw, the company created Eaux de Cologne 'Paradiso Perduto', 'Tabacco Ambrato', 'Fior di Loto' and 'Fiori degli Esperidi'; Gran Premio, a perfume for women, Curaderma, the after-bath moisturising cream, and Barbasana for men, to be used at the time of shaving.In the 1920s, ""Velluto di Hollywood"", a fine powder that could be applied with either a dry or wet sponge, was launched. The product represented the glamour of American film stars.At the same time, the company, like many other large and famous brands of the time, embarked on the path of advertising, also engaging famous brands for its billboards, among all that of Gino Boccasile who in 1946 created a poster with a young lady bare breasts that cause a stir. Quartetto Cetra, Ornella Vanoni, Alberto Lupo, Erminio Macario and Sandra Mondaini appear in the Carosello sketches.In 2007, Debora Paglieri won the gold medal for entrepreneurial commitment and economic progress (Alessandria Chamber of Commerce).In 2008, according to EURISPES, Paglieri was included in the Top-3 ""Our Excellence"" Report, one hundred success stories of the Italian System.Between 2010 and 2011, the company acquired the historic pharmaceutical brand Schiapparelli.
In 2018, Paglieri won the Smau Innovation Award as an example of improving production processes and optimizing the work of operators.In 2020, the company got recognition of Historic Brand with national interest with Felce Azzurra and Schiapparelli.
In June 2022, the company finalises a change in ownership and appoints a new board of directors made up of CEOs Debora Paglieri, Fabio Rossello and Lodovico Paglieri and Ginevra Rossello Paglieri as board director, while Aldo Paglieri is non-executive chairman.In December 2022, the company acquired for approximately 10 million euros control of Agopag, a company based in Spinetta Marengo and specialized in plastic processing.In 2023, the Ministry of Business and Made in Italy released a stamp belonging to the thematic series ""The Excellence of the Production and Economic System"" to celebrate the 100 the milestones of Felce Azzurra brand.

The Night of Enitharmon's Joy,"The Night of Enitharmon's Joy, often referred as The Triple Hecate or simply Hecate, is a 1795 work of art by the English artist and poet William Blake which depicts Enitharmon, a female character in his mythology, or Hecate, a chthonic Greco-Roman goddess of magic and the underworld. The work presents a nightmarish scene with fantastic creatures.The Triple Hecate is painted with deep tones and bold masses. Blake employed a new technique whose ""effect is darker and richer than [his] illuminated books"". One scholar interprets his colour print Hecate thus:

""She is triple, according to mythology: a girl and a boy hide their heads behind her back. Her left hand lies on a book of magic; her left foot is extended. She is attended by a thistle-eating ass, the mournful owl of false wisdom, the head of a crocodile (blood-thirsty hypocrisy), and a cat-headed bat.""
Blake often drew on Michelangelo to create and compose his epic images, including Hecate's, according to a consensus of critics. ""Blake is indebted to Michelangelo for many of his giant forms"". Michelangelo contributed many ""characters to Blake's gallery of mythic persons and heroes"". Regarding the Hecate colour print, a suggested trail may be traced. From Michelangelo, Blake copied his early sketch entitled The Reposing Traveller, which then evolved into a figure for his work (1795-1797) regarding Night Thoughts, and also into the similarly posed figure of Hecate here.The image may also allude to the Three Fates — the Moirai of Greek mythology and the Parcae of Roman. Notwithstanding these allusions, critics point out that a contemporary trigger for Blake's inspiration probably was the return popularity of Shakespeare's play Macbeth. As Hecate listens offstage, the three witches, in arranging Macbeth's doom, chant: ""Double, double, toil and trouble; Fire burn and cauldron bubble"". Each witch in turn adds her verses, the second's being:

""Fillet of a fenny snake,
In the cauldron boil and bake;
Eye of newt and toe of frog,
Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,
Lizard's leg and owlet's wing,
For a charm of powerful trouble,
Like a hell-broth boil and bubble."" (Macbeth, IV.i)Hence, bat, owl, snake or frog would be appropriate to The Triple Hecate.Blake printed his illuminated Europe a Prophecy in 1794. The bulk of the book, according to one scholar, ""is devoted to the night of Enitharmon's joy, when she establishes her Woman's World with its false religion of chastity and vengeance: a religion of eighteen hundred years, which is the error of official Christianity."" In other words, it is said to represent a Feminine Will over a patriarchal Christianity. Blake's character is described as ""the Moon of love to Los's Sun"", hence its relationship with Hecate, one of the Moon Goddesses alongside Diana/Artemis and Selene. She is also invoked in Hamlet, in the play within the play method, by the (actor) Lucianus: ""With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected, Thy natural magic and dire property [...]"" but in Europe: a Prophecy Enitharmon's night is presented in this way:

""Now comes the night of Enitharmon's joy!
Who shall I call? Who shall I send?
That Woman, lovely Woman! may have dominion
Arise O Rintrah thee I call! & Palamabron thee.
Go! tell the human race that Womans love is Sin!
That an Eternal life awaits the worms of sixty winters
In an allegorical abode where existence hath never come:
Forbid all Joy, & from her childhood shall the little female
Spread nets in every secret path.""There are other literary sources for the myth of Hecate, such as Metamorphoses by Ovid, VI 140, VII 74, 94, 174, 177, 194, 241, XIV 44, 405, and Blake himself: ""The Gods all Serve her at her will; so great her Power is, like fabled Hecate, she doth bind them to her law."" (Blake, Then She bore Pale desire…). But not only in his poetry The Triple Hecate makes a connection: it is seen as an opposition to his painting Pity, circa 1795, where the piety provides a ""possibility of salvation"" in the fallen world. Here, both witchcraft and curse, associated with Hecate, are factors to human perdition. Geoffrey Keynes wrote about it:

""Hecate, an infernal Trinity, crouches in the centre. An evil winged spectre hovers over her. On her left an ass is grazing on rank vegetation, while an owl and a great toad watch from between rocks. The theme of the Moon Goddess is derived from Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream.""
The image was created in a time in which Shakespeare's Macbeth had a revival, being performed nine times. Like other works by Blake, such as The Ghost of a Flea, the picture is part of W. Graham Robertson's private collection and was presented to the Tate Gallery by himself in 1939. It is considered to be one of the most brilliant and significant pictures of William Blake.

Bullard Machine Tool Company,"The Bullard Machine Tool Company was a large American machine tool builder. It specialized in vertical boring mills and was largely responsible for the development of the modern form of that class of machine tools.The firm was founded in 1894 by Edward Payson Bullard Sr. (born April 18, 1841 in Uxbridge, Massachusetts, USA; died December 22, 1906 in Bridgeport, Connecticut, USA). He received formative experience at the Colt armory and Pratt & Whitney, which were influential development centers for generations of toolmakers.  Bullard Sr is believed to have developed the first small boring machine designed to do the accurate work previously performed on the faceplate of a lathe. Roe (1916) says that ""Up to that time boring machines were relied on only for large and rough work.""Bullard Sr.'s son, Edward Payson Bullard Jr. (1872–1953), continued the family machine tool business and brought the turret principle to the vertical boring mill, making it a vertical turret lathe. For a while in America during the 20th century, the name ""Bullard"" on the shop floor was something of a genericized trademark for vertical turret-head boring mills. E.P. Bullard Jr led the development of the company's multiple-spindle Mult-Au-Matic brand machine that became an important automatic lathe in the mass production of parts for the automotive industry. Bullard Jr was president of the company for 40 years, through World War I, the interwar period, and World War II, a period during which the Bullard company was the largest machine tool builder in the U.S., and vast volumes of military matériel were produced by countless companies running Bullard machines.

2017 end-of-year rugby union internationals,"The 2017 end-of-year rugby union internationals, also known as the November internationals, or autumn internationals in the Northern Hemisphere, were international rugby union matches in 2017.
Rugby Championship winners New Zealand travelled to France for two matches (one an uncapped XV match), Scotland and Wales. Argentina faced England, Ireland and Italy - with the latter two countries also hosting South Africa. The Springboks also faced their June test series opposition, France, whom they had beaten 3–0, before ending their tour in Wales, after the international window. Having beaten New Zealand in the third Bledisloe Cup Test match in October, Australia travelled to play Wales, England and Scotland, the latter of whom had beaten the Wallabies in Sydney during the June internationals.
Four Tier 2 nations faced Tier 1 opposition during the international window. Ireland and Italy hosted Fiji, the first time since 2009 for Ireland. England and Scotland played host to Samoa. France and Wales hosted historic matches against Tier 2 opposition, with Wales playing Georgia for the first time and France hosting Japan for the first time in the professional era; Japan's previous visit to France came in 1973. For Japan this was the third time in five years that they had played two Tier 1 opponents during the November tests, having already hosted Australia prior to their away match against France.


== Tier 2 and Tier 3 ==
After defeating Canada and the United States away earlier in the year, Georgia played host to the same opposition at home. Romania took on Pacific opposition, hosting Samoa, and playing Samoa, for the first time since 1989, before playing host to Tonga after losing for the first time against them in 2015. For the second year in a row, Spain faced Tier 2 opposition from outside of Europe, facing Canada in what was the first meeting since they first played in 2010. As in previous November internationals, travelling Tier 2 nations faced each other at neutral venues in Europe. This year saw Japan face Tonga in Toulouse, while Fiji faced Canada in Narbonne. With Uruguay's 2019 Rugby World Cup qualifier play-offs taking place in February 2018, they embarked on a two-test series against Namibia as preparation. This was the first time since 2000 that the two nations has met, and the first time Namibia hosted the Los Teros.Having won their two-test series against Brazil in November 2015 and November 2016, Germany faced Brazil for the third year in a row, this time in a one-off test match. Germany later went on to face Chile and the United States, in what were historic first ever matches between the respective nations. Brazil also faced historic opposition, playing Belgium and Spain for the first time.

What a Way to Go!,"What a Way to Go! is a 1964 American black comedy film directed by J. Lee Thompson and starring Shirley MacLaine, Paul Newman, Robert Mitchum, Dean Martin, Gene Kelly, Bob Cummings and Dick Van Dyke.

In the film, a wealthy widow wants to donate most of her fortune to the Internal Revenue Service. She narrates her life story to her psychiatrist. Each of her past husbands found wealth and success, but met with tragic deaths. She thinks she is cursed, and she would instead prefer a ""simple life"" inspired by the writings of Henry David Thoreau. 


== Plot ==
In a dream-like pre-credit sequence, Louisa, a black-clad widow, descends a pink staircase inside a pink mansion. She is followed by pallbearers carrying a pink coffin. The pallbearers slip and drop the coffin, which slides down the stairs, leading into the opening titles.
Louisa wants to give her $211 million to the U.S. government Internal Revenue Service, who believes it is an April Fools' Day joke. Sobbing to her unstable psychiatrist, Dr. Stephanson, Louisa tries to explain why she wants to give away her money, leading to a series of flashbacks, interspersed with fantasy sequences.
Louisa describes her childhood as being a young, idealistic girl. Her money-grubbing mother pushed Louisa to marry rich local business owner, Leonard Crawley. Louisa instead marries Edgar Hopper, a poor shop owner who, inspired by Henry David Thoreau, prefers a simple life. They are happily poor until the jilted Leonard arrives and ridicules their rustic lifestyle, humiliating Edgar and motivating him to achieve success. Edgar transforms his small store into a tremendous empire, neglecting Louisa, ruining Crawley, and eventually overworking himself to an early death. 
A grieving Louisa travels to Paris where she meets Larry Flint, an impoverished avant-garde artist. They fall in love, marry, and live a picturesque bohemian lifestyle. Larry invents a crane-like machine that converts eclectic sounds into paint strokes on canvas. One day, Louisa plays classical music that produces a beautiful painting resulting in Larry's first major art sale. Larry builds larger cranes and sells many more paintings, making him a successful artist. One night, two petulant cranes turn on their creator and beat him to death.
Louisa, richer and more depressed, prepares to return to the US. When she misses her flight, famed business tycoon Rod Anderson Jr. offers her a lift on his private jet. She initially finds him cold and calculating, but sees his softer side during the flight. They marry shortly after and live luxuriously. Fearful of losing him like her first two husbands, Louisa convinces Rod to retire to a small farm similar to his boyhood home. After sharing a jug with a few locals, an inebriated Rod mistakenly attempts to milk a bull, which kicks him through the barn wall, leaving Louisa widowed once again.
Now fantastically wealthy, Louisa wanders the country. In a small-town café, she meets Pinky Benson who, for over a decade, has performed nightly dressed as a clown. Management loves Pinky's corny musical act because it never distracts the customers from eating and drinking. The two fall in love and idyllically live aboard Pinky's run-down houseboat on the Hudson River. On Pinky's birthday, Louisa suggests he perform without his usual time-consuming clown make-up and costume so they will not be late for his party after the show. 
Without his clown getup, the customers notice that Pinky sings and dances beautifully. Virtually overnight, Pinky is a famous Hollywood star. He neglects Louisa and becomes so arrogant and self-centered that he has the entire mansion painted pink so fans will know it is his. At his film premiere, despite being warned, Pinky insists on greeting his excited fans. They become frenzied and trample Pinky to death.
After hearing Louisa's story, Dr. Stephanson proposes marriage, claiming to be the simple man she wants. She declines, which she declares is progress in her recovery. Stephanson accidentally presses the switch that raises the movable psychiatric couch about ten feet. Sitting on the edge, he falls off and is knocked unconscious, leaving Louisa stranded on top. The janitor enters and helps Louisa down. She is shocked it is Leonard Crawley, who lost everything after Edgar Hopper ruined his business. Leonard claims he is happy and credits Louisa and Thoreau for making his life ""successful"" because it is simple.
Leonard and Louisa marry and enjoy a bucolic life on a farm with their four children. The story ends when Leonard, plowing a field, is distracted while reading Thoreau and apparently strikes oil after the tractor tire grinds into the ground. Louisa is distraught, believing her curse has struck again until oil company representatives arrive and say that Leonard punctured their pipeline. Leonard and Louisa rejoice, as they are still poor but happy.


== Cast ==


== Production ==


=== Development ===
Publicist Arthur Jacobs wanted to move into film production. One of his clients was Marilyn Monroe who said she would appear in a movie Jacobs produced if she liked the story. He found I Love Louisa based on a story by Gwen Davis about a woman with six husbands. In June 1962, Darryl F. Zanuck reportedly told Marilyn Monroe that she would make two films for 20th Century-Fox (which he was in the process of taking over again): a re-vived Something's Got to Give and What a Way to Go (the alternate title for I Love Louisa). Monroe's fee would be a million dollars for both films. In July, Monroe reportedly approved J. Lee Thompson as director after watching Tiger Bay and Northwest Frontier and she was going to meet Gene Kelly to discuss his being her co-star. Monroe died in August 1962.
In September 1962, Jacobs said that J. Lee Thompson, who was another client of his, would direct the film following The Mound Builders (which became Kings of the Sun). Jacobs wanted one of the ""top three"" stars in the world to play the lead, and ""important names"" to play the six husbands. No distributor had been signed. Later that month Thompson said he would make I Love Louisa with Elizabeth Taylor. In October the Los Angeles Times reported that the Mirisch Company, who had a long-term deal with Thompson, would finance. That month Betty Comden and Adolph Green signed to write the script. In December Thompson said Comden and Green wanted to call the movie What a Way to Go and that he hoped Frank Sinatra and Marcello Matroianni to play husbands.In January 1963, Thompson said he was confident about Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando and David Niven playing husbands. In April 1963 Hedda Hopper reported that Steve McQueen would star in the film opposite Shirley MacLaine.MacLaine was formally signed in July 1963. Also that month Jacobs announced he had signed a deal with 20th Century-Fox for the latter to finance and distribute. The production companies would be Jacob's Apjac and Thompson's Malibu Productions. The stars would be MacLaine, Dean Martin, Paul Newman, Robert Mitchum, Dick Van Dyke and Gene Kelly. Filming would start 8 August. Jacobs called the project ""a sad comedy – a farout picture that has both loudness and pathos.""According to Mitchum, Frank Sinatra had wanted $500,000 for two weeks worth of work, so they offered the role to Mitchum instead. He agreed to do it because he liked working with MacLaine and Thompson (who had directed him in Cape Fear).MacLaine said, ""There is – I hope – pathos, anyway that's what I'm trying to do. It's funny for a girl to go through five husbands, getting wealthier with the death of each one – but it's sad, too, because she didn't want them to die and she hates money.""Gene Kelly originally had the rights to the story, intending to direct it, but relinquished it to Jacobs.  Kelly agreed to appear in a single sequence. He choreographed the dance as well, calling it ""a kind of gentle spoof of old movie musicals, though not as much of a parody, really, as Sing Along with Mitch.""Robert Mitchum's role was originally meant for Frank Sinatra, but Sinatra suddenly wanted several times more money than what the other male leads received, and the studio refused his demands. Gregory Peck was sought, but he was unavailable. The previous year, MacLaine had co-starred with Mitchum in Two for the Seesaw, and she recommended him to director J. Lee Thompson who passed the endorsement on to the studio.Cummings signed in September 1963.The budget was a reported $5 million.


=== Shooting ===
Except for one scene at Los Angeles Airport, the entire film was shot on the Fox backlot on 73 sets. Because of the limited availability of the stars, the movie was shot over 45 days, which was considered short for a movie of this scale.The swimming pool set in the Pinky Benson sequences is the same set (with some minor redressing) used for Something's Got to Give.
MacLaine was quoted as saying that she was happy to work with ""Edith Head with a $500,000 budget, 72 hairstyles to match the gowns, and a $3.5-million gem collection loaned by Harry Winston of New York. Pretty good perks, I'd say.""


== Reception ==


=== Box office performance ===
What a Way to Go! premiered on May 12, 1964, and grossed $11,180,531 at the U.S. box office, earning $6.10 million in the United States.According to Fox records, the film needed to earn $8.5 million in film rentals to break even and made $9.09 million, meaning it made a profit.


=== Film critics ===
John Simon of The New Leader wrote ""The mildest thing that can be said about this film is that it is an abomination"".


=== Awards ===
What a Way to Go! was nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Art Direction (Jack Martin Smith, Ted Haworth, Walter M. Scott, Stuart A. Reiss) and Best Costume Design by Edith Head and Moss Mabry, a BAFTA Best Foreign Actress Award for Shirley MacLaine, a Laurel award for Best Comedy and Best Comedy performer for Paul Newman, and an American Cinema Editors Eddie award for best editor for Marjorie Fowler. It won a Locarno Film Festival award for Best Actor for Gene Kelly.

Baltimore police strike,"The Baltimore Police Strike was a 1974 labor action conducted by officers of the Baltimore Police Department. Striking officers sought better wages and changes to BPD policy. They also expressed solidarity with Baltimore municipal workers, who were in the midst of an escalating strike action that began on July 1. On July 7, police launched a campaign of intentional misbehavior and silliness; on July 11 they began a formal strike. The department reported an increase in fires and looting, and the understaffed BPD soon received support from Maryland State Police. The action ended on July 15, when union officials negotiated an end to both strikes. The city promised (and delivered) police officers a wage increase in 1975, but refused amnesty for the strikers. Police Commissioner Donald Pomerleau revoked the union's collective bargaining rights, fired its organizers, and pointedly harassed its members.
The Baltimore action was one of a handful police strikes in the United States since the Boston Police Strike of 1919, and was followed by a wave of police unrest in U.S. cities. The action was also test case for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), which was rapidly growing in size and strength but had not had much success in unionizing police officers.


== Background ==


=== Police unionization in Baltimore ===
City officials opposed the organization of police as a group of workers, fearing the breakdown of order that might result from police strikes. However, Baltimore had a high proportion of minority and pro-union officers. Police officers who wanted to unionize met in secret for years before voting in 1966 to form Police Local 1195, a chapter of AFSCME.  One of Local 1195's key leaders was Thomas Rapanotti—a labor organizer who worked in a coal mine, then at Martin Aircraft, then for AFSCME. Rapanotti expanded the union in Baltimore and made inroads into surrounding counties.The Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) immediately presented itself as a competing union. FOP Lodge #3, which still exists, is independent from other types of workers and less militant as a labor group.


=== Conflict with Pomerleau ===
Baltimore's Police Commissioner, Donald D. Pomerleau, was particularly hostile to the idea of a police union. He repeatedly declined requests (from Baltimore's AFSCME Local 44 as well as from within BPD) to recognize Local 1195, even when much of the police force had joined.Local 1195 and its allies in organized labor voiced many complaints against Pomerleau. In addition to criticizing Pomerleau's changes to department policy, they accused him of harassing and intimidating union leaders. The AFL–CIO called his actions 'union-busting'. In 1968, officers picketed BPD headquarters and demanded his resignation. Grievances with Pomerleau continued to mount. In a 1973 grand jury investigation on corruption within the BPD, Rapanotti accused him of spying and of applying polygraphs tests selectively only to lower-ranking officers. Banned from striking by its constitution, in March of this year the union began to consider job actions.


=== Collective bargaining ===
By 1973, about 2,000 of Baltimore's 3,500 police officers claimed membership in Local 1195. AFSCME leaders and representatives from other public employee unions and organizations pressed the City of Baltimore for collective bargaining rights and higher wages. Some of the officers had worked previously at Bethlehem Steel and been on strike before.In November 1973, Pomerleau agreed to recognize collective representation for police, and held an election to choose an exclusive bargaining agent. He stipulated that whatever the result, no secondary boycotts, slow-downs, stoppages, or strikes would be allowed. Local 1195 won the election by a large margin, with 1,488 votes to 769 for FOP 3. Turnout was 85%. After Local 1195's victory, Rapanotti laid out a 26-point proposal for the city.Local 1195 immediately attempted to make good on the promise that collective bargaining might improve conditions and wages for police officers. The police asked for an increase of their salary range from $8,761–$11,082 to $12,500–$14,500.  The city offered 5.5% raise, with a 0.5% increase in benefits. This package had recently been accepted by other city workers, including teachers, who went on strike in February of the same year. (The salary raise was 5.5% or 20 cents an hour, whichever was greater for the workers at hand. For many other municipal employees, 20 cents an hour was greater.) On June 30, Local 1195 voted unanimously to reject the city's offer.


== Actions begin ==
The lead-up to the police strike was a period of radical labor activity and unrest, sparked by a walkout of the city's garbage collectors.


=== Municipal workers strike ===

On July 1, 1974, over 700 sanitation workers walked off their jobs in a wildcat strike (against the wishes of their union leadership in AFSCME Local 44). Workers cited low wages (they wanted a 50 cent raise instead of a 20 cent raise) and undignified conditions (heat, exhaust fumes, and poorly maintained trucks) as reasons for striking.  Mayor Schaefer threatened to fire them all. Soon after the strike began, AFSCME announced its support and sent major leaders from its national offices. By July 7 approximately 2,500 municipal sanitation workers, corrections officers, and other personnel had gone on strike. The atmosphere created by this strike emboldened the police force to push harder for their own demands.


=== Police job actions ===
Baltimore's police officers sympathized with other city workers, increasing their readiness to strike. The municipal strike—with garbage pileups and rioting inmates—also created an atmosphere of crisis, in which the role of police would be especially conspicuous. On July 6, the union formed a steering committee, with 84 members, to plan job actions intended to pressure the city for negotiations. According to the findings disclosed by a 1977 court case, these actions had ""tacit approval"" from Commissioner Pomerleau, who also wanted the city to negotiate further.On July 7, police began 'job actions' that signaled their discontent. Officers would write lengthy reports on pennies (""objects of value"") found along the side of the road and would turn obvious samples of tobacco over to the police lab for drug analysis. There was a massive increase in traffic stops and a 1000% increase in tickets issued. One ticket led to an altercation resulting in three arrests. Mayor Schaefer's limousine was ticketed twice. Kenneth Webster, a state delegate, was arrested (on littering charges), for tearing up one of these tickets in front of the ticketing officer. John A. Lann, a police officer, was arrested and suspended from the BPD for blocking traffic on the newly constructed I-83. Union officials threatened a total strike if he was not released.These actions mounted day by day and garnered widespread attention. On July 10, police cars blocked two out of three lanes on Franklin St. downtown.


=== Decision to strike ===
Pressure for a strike had been building since the new contract was announced on June 30. Rapanotti opposed a full strike, predicting (correctly): ""This thing is only a week old. If you pull and strike at this moment, they're going over there and offer the garbagemen some money, and we're going to be standing there holding our Yo-Yo's."" But after four days of job actions, the union's members were ready to escalate.
After meeting for an hour and a half on the afternoon of Thursday, July 11, members of the steering committee decided unanimously to go on strike.


== Police officers strike ==
At 8PM on July 11, 39 officers on the 4PM–12AM shift returned to their stations and turned in their equipment. They were joined by 33 members of the Tactical Section.  Only 96 (of 238 scheduled) showed up for the midnight shift. Striking officers established picket lines at seven stations.  The Baltimore Sun reported that looting began immediately in West and East Baltimore.Strikers formed picket lines and carried signs reading ""I will not die for 5.5"" and ""Professional Pay for Professional Service"".


=== Striking and nonstriking officers ===
It is estimated that nearly 1,300 police officers of the 2,300 went on strike. Nonstriking officers worked overtime: 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. (According to Pomerleau, there were only 565 strikers; most sources said his estimate was too low.)
Newspapers reported tension between striking and non-striking officers.  ""Don't trust that guy,"" one striking officer said of a working officer to a national guard soldier. Some nonstriking officers likewise felt betrayed by their fellow workers and by Local 1195, which was officially a non-striking union.Officers of the Fraternal Order of Police released statements opposing the strike.Fourteen white youths picketed the strikers, displaying signs that said ""Safety First; Money Second"".


=== Effect on crime ===
After the walkout on Thursday, July 11, the BPD and the fire department received increased looting and arson reports. Trash fires (facilitated by the sanitation workers' strike) were the most common violation reported. These fires intensified immediately in southwest Baltimore, where all 22 officers on the night shift had walked off.  Fire alarms increased to hundreds per day, and some fire fighters were harassed when they arrived on the scene. Neighborhoods already high in crime saw more of it.Police reported that the city was particularly quiet on the night of Friday, July 12. This abrupt halt in reported crimes coincided with the visible arrival of outside forces.
One man, identified as a looter, was shot and killed by a nonstriking officer on July 12. Commissioner Pomerleau declared, ""We're in a semi-riot mode, similar to the 1968 riots."" However, activity in the streets never reached the same levels, and much less damage resulted.


== Government response ==
The strike met with opposition from the city government, the state government, and the judiciary. These authorities reacted more severely to the police strike than to the simultaneous municipal strike.
Before midnight on July 11, Circuit Judge James C. Murphy issued an injunction ordering the strike to end immediately. This injunction had no immediate mechanism for enforcement.
On July 12, Maryland governor Marvin Mandel ordered outside police help from 115 state troopers and ten canine units. They arrived with 100 cruisers and a tractor-trailer carrying two jeeps. These troops were outfitted with riot weapons but wore soft hats instead of helmets.The Maryland National Guard was put on alert but Mandel said he did not expect them to become involved.Also on July 12, Commissioner Pomerleau announced that 457 officers had been suspended.On Saturday, July 13, Judge Murphy declared a fine for each day of striking—$25,000 for the union and $10,000 for Rapanotti. He also threatened Rapanotti with jail if the strike continued beyond 10AM on Monday July 15. (Murphy issued parallel threats to union leaders connected to the ongoing municipal workers' strike.)
On July 14, Pomerleau fired 82 officers and demoted 9 detectives and 18 police agents (officers with college degrees). All the officers fired were 'probationary', meaning that they had served on the force for under two years; Commissioner Pomerleau stated that these officers were not entitled to hearings for their jobs. He further announced that there would be ""no general amnesty"", and that all striking workers would be fired unless they resumed their jobs immediately.


== Negotiations ==
The police walkout quickly triggered negotiations for both police and the striking municipal workers. Union representatives and city officials met for five hours on July 12, the day after the night shift walkout. With leaders of both Locals under direct threats from Judge Murphy, marathon negotiations continued day and night, with few breaks. These negotiations were tightly controlled by outside representatives of AFSCME, who temporarily suspended Rapanotti for negotiating without accompaniment.On Sunday, July 14, AFSCME negotiators responded to Commissioner Pomerleau (who had just fired 82 officers, threatened to fire more, and declared no amnesty) that amnesty would be a condition of settlement.On Monday, July 15, the city announced its settlement with Local 44: a 25 cent-raise immediately, and an additional 45 cents in 1975. The arrangement with the police was less clear. According to Mandel and Pomerleau, union leaders had promised that the officers would return to work. Leaders of the police union then announced in a press conference that they had been ""assured of fair play"" and that ""many would be reinstated""—but there was still no promise of amnesty. Rapanonotti announced that the decision would be taken for ratification to a committee of strikers. Police officers would receive no immediate increase in salary. An increase of the salary range to $10,000–$13,500 was planned for July 1975.Striking officers ratified the agreement on the morning July 16. Many of the strikers felt defeated, and most had already returned to work. Many of those who had been fired came to the meeting to express anger and frustration about the negotiations. Before this group would vote had to be reassured that leaders would seek amnesty.


== Aftermath ==
Pomerleau announced that returning strikers would be treated harshly, writing in a July 18 letter : ""I have asked the sergeants of this department to 'take charge.' If they wish to deprive a striker of an air-conditioned car or refuse to assign a striker to overtime duties that is their prerogative and, I will back them up."" These returning workers were also banned from park and stadium patrols, and from assuming ""officer in charge"" status.Pomerleau suspended and then fired George P. Hoyt, president of AFSCME Local 1195 and leader of the strike. Hoyt had been a member of the force for 17 years and was four days away from retirement when he was fired. Pomerleau subsequently fired dozens more officers, including all of Local 1195's remaining officials.On July 25, Pomerleau issued a message, posted on bulletin boards and read for three days at roll call, which distinguished between strike leaders and followers. In this message, he specified the offenses that would in particular be punished:

Thomas Bradley, president of the Metropolitan Baltimore Labor Council (a regional arm of the AFL–CIO), promised to establish a committee ""who will see to it that there are no reprisals"". AFSCME president Jerry Wurf also promised to help the officers get their jobs back. These campaigns were ultimately unsuccessful.
Judge Murphy fined AFSCME $15,000 and union organizer Thomas Rapanotti $10,000. None of the striking officers or leaders were imprisoned.


=== Impact on the union ===
On July 17, Commissioner Pomerleau revoked the union's right to bargain, citing the terms of his 1973 order. He also announced and announced that union dues would no longer be 'checked off' automatically from workers' paychecks and that union leaders would not be allowed to visit police headquarters unescorted.The union of police supervisors (Local 1599), withdrew their membership in AFSCME.Local 1195, along with AFSCME, filed a lawsuit against Pomerleau and Mandel for union busting and illegal spying. The suit also accused Captain Donald E. Einolf and Edward Crowder as agents of an anti-union conspiracy. This lawsuit was lost in 1977.The city refused to allow police collective bargaining (let alone right to strike) until 1982.


=== Resentment ===
With no reprieve from the city, the formerly striking officers turned to Governor Mandel, asking him to re-authorize their union and impose amnesty. Mandel, feuding with AFSCME president Wurf, refused to assist them, declaring that he would prefer to lose the union's support in his re-election campaign.Some officers felt sold out, or used as ""cannon fodder,"" by the union leaders. Twenty of the officers who were fired sued national and local AFSCME offices in 1977 for false representation and negligence, charging that they should not have authorized an illegal strike that could lead them to lose their jobs.Tension persisted between strikers and non-strikers. Some of the officers who did not strike opposed amnesty for those who did.

Mission Railway Bridge,"The Mission Railway Bridge is a Canadian Pacific Railway bridge spanning the Fraser River between Mission, and Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada.
Replacing an earlier bridge built in 1891, which was the first and only bridge crossing of the Fraser below Siska in the Fraser Canyon until the construction of the New Westminster rail bridge in 1904, it was constructed in 1909 by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR).  The Mission Railway Bridge is supported by 13 concrete piers and is approximately 533 metres in length.  Before completion of the Mission highway bridge, highway traffic to and from Matsqui and Abbotsford with Mission used the bridge as a one-way alternating route, with traffic lights at either end to control direction.  Rail traffic often held up car crossings, causing long and often very lengthy waits, which were a part of daily life in the Central Valley until the new bridge was completed.  
Beneath the bridge's north abutment is an important river-level gauge monitored during the annual Fraser freshet.  The bridge is also the location of the end of the Fraser's tidal bore - downstream from the bridge the river is increasingly influenced by tidal influences from the Georgia Strait.


== Swing span ==
The Mission Railway Bridge has a swing span which has a vertical clearance of 4.9 metres above the water when closed.  The swing span is fitted atop a circular concrete pier, the 10th from the north bank of the river.  The 10th pier is protected from shipping traffic by two 46 metre wood piers extending upstream and downstream respectively perpendicular to the bridge which are tapered at both ends.  The navigation channel past the bridge is 30 metres in width.  At night a fixed white light is displayed on piers 9 and 11 as well as at the up-river and down-river ends of the protection pier.
The majority of marine traffic consists of log tows and gravel barges, which are permitted to use the navigation channel beneath the fixed span between piers 5 and 6.  The swing span is used for wood chip barges and other vessels which cannot navigate beneath the span between piers 5 and 6.
CPR maintains a bridge tender 24 hours per day at an office on the north bank of the bridge.  Vessels requesting passage through the swing span contact the bridge tender on marine VHF radio, whereby the tender walks the bridge to a control booth situated on the swing span.

Innenstadt (Braunschweig),"The Innenstadt (""inner city"") is the central Stadtbezirk (borough) of Braunschweig, Germany. The district consists of five formerly independent city municipal areas (Altewiek, Altstadt, Hagen, Neustadt, and Sack), and is surrounded by the river Oker and in area nearly identical to the medieval city of Braunschweig.


== History ==
It wasn't until the 19th century, when industrialisation caused rapid population growth, that Braunschweig was enlarged beyond its medieval fortifications and the Oker. Therefore, up to that point the history of Innenstadt is identical with that of the city itself.From the Middle Ages up to the early modern period, Braunschweig's population ranged between about 15,000 and 25,000 people, making it one of the largest German cities at the time. Today 13,500 people live in the Innenstadt. Due to the city's growth since the 19th century, the district today therefore is home to just about 5.5% of Braunschweig's population, and makes up only 2.1% of its current area.During World War II the allied air raids destroyed 90 percent of Braunschweig's inner city. A small section of the Altstadt survived the bombing, and since the 1990s there also have been increased efforts to restore and reconstruct historic buildings that had been destroyed in the war.


== Politics ==
The district mayor, Ines Werner, is a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany.


== Main sights ==
Most of Braunschweig's main sights are located within the inner city, including the five so called Traditionsinseln - parts of the medieval city that either survived World War II or were reconstructed since then.The Traditionsinseln are:

The Burgplatz (Castle Square), with Dankwarderode Castle, Brunswick Lion, and Brunswick Cathedral
The Altstadtmarkt (""Old Town Market"")
The Michaelisviertel (St. Michael's Quarter)
The Magniviertel (St. Magnus' Quarter)
The Aegidienviertel (St. Giles' Quarter)Also located within the district are the Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum, the State Museum of Brunswick, Brunswick Palace, and the State Theatre. The Innenstadt is Braunschweig's main shopping district and home to the city's annual christmas market.

USS S-5,"USS S-5 (SS-110) was a ""Government-type"" S-class submarine of the United States Navy. Her keel was laid down on 4 December 1917 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard of Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 10 November 1919, sponsored by Mrs. Glenn S. Burrell, and commissioned on 6 March 1920 with Lieutenant Commander Charles M. ""Savvy"" Cooke, Jr., in command. She sank accidentally during full-power trials on 1 September 1920, but due to actions by her crew and the crews of other ships, there were no deaths. Refloated, she was lost when she sank again while under tow on 3 September 1920.


== Loss ==


=== Sinking ===
Following builder's trials, outfitting, and crew training, S-5 departed Boston Navy Yard, Boston, Massachusetts, on 30 August 1920 to undergo full-power trials in the Atlantic Ocean 55 nautical miles (102 km; 63 mi) off the Delaware Capes. At 13:00 on 1 September, she commenced a dive for a submerged test run. Water unexpectedly entered the submarine through the main air induction system, pouring into the control room, engine room, torpedo room, and motor room.Normal procedure was to leave the main air induction valve open until the engines had a chance to come to a full stop, this operation being so timed as to occur just prior to complete submergence. In the case of S-5, however, the chief of the boat, Gunner's Mate Percy Fox, the man responsible for operating this valve, was momentarily distracted. Noticing the mistake, he grabbed the valve lever and jerked hard, causing the valve to jam open. After considerable difficulty, the system valves in the other compartments were closed, but all efforts to secure the torpedo room valve met with failure. The abandoned torpedo room flooded, making the boat bow-heavy. An additional 80 long tons (81 t) of water in the motor room bilges caused her to settle on the bottom. It was now impossible to eject water from the torpedo room. An attempt was then made to pump out the motor room, but a gasket blew out and there were no means for repair. Lying 180 ft (55 m) on the bottom, the crew had little hope of being found, much less being rescued.The crew reasoned that sufficient buoyancy in the after section could tilt the sub on her nose and extend the stern above the surface. The tilt would cause the water in the motor room to drain forward and increase buoyancy further. However, there was great risk involved because this would allow salt water into the battery room, which would generate deadly chlorine gas. They hoped to have enough time, after the water had entered, to close the watertight door before the gas could reach a dangerous level. After making preparations, air was applied to the after ballast and fuel tanks, blowing them dry. The stern began to rise and then shot to the surface. Men, floor plates, bilge water, and other loose objects fell through the length of the submarine. One man nearly drowned in the battery room, but was fished out, and the compartment door was sealed against the gas.
By tapping on the hull, it was determined that the stern extended about 17 ft (5.2 m) above the water. With inadequate tools, they took turns trying to cut a hole in the thick hull. After 36 hours, they had only succeeded in making a hole 3 in (76 mm) in diameter.


=== Rescue ===
A seaman on watch aboard the wooden steamship Alanthus, making her last voyage, spotted what he thought was a buoy on 2 September 1920.  Knowing that no buoy should be so far out to sea, Alanthus's captain turned his vessel around to investigate. Approaching the submarine's stern rising above the ocean, the captain hailed S-5 in maritime fashion. That conversation became legend:

""What ship?""
""S-5.""
""What nationality?""
""American.""
""Where bound?""
""Hell by compass.""Alanthus could not help with the cutting, but was able to rig a pump to provide air, provide fresh water for drinking, and rig cables under S-5's stern to hold it above the surface. Alanthus had no radio, but at about 18:00 was able to contact the passing Panama Railroad Steamship Company steamer SS General G. W. Goethals using signal flags.General G. W. Goethals, which was on voyage from Haiti to New York City, had a radio and contacted the U.S. Navy, and her crew immediately began enlarging the hole. By 01:45 on 3 September 1920, it was big enough to squirm through. At 03:00 on 3 September, Lieutenant Commander Cooke became the last member of S-5's crew to leave the submarine. Her crew had suffered no deaths or serious injuries.
Later that morning, the battleship USS Ohio secured a towline to the stern of S-5 and proceeded to tow her to shallower water. The towline, however, parted and the loose submarine bobbed, then plunged to the bottom about 15 nmi (28 km; 17 mi) off Cape May, New Jersey. The Navy began an unsuccessful attempt to raise S-5, but called it off in November 1920. A second effort in 1921 also was unsuccessful, and S-5 was struck from the Naval Vessel Register that year. She was the fourth submarine lost in U.S. Navy history.


== Discovery of wreck ==
The exact location of the wreck of S-5 remained unknown until July 2001, when the Office of Ocean Exploration at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) asked the NOAA survey ship NOAAS Whiting to search for it. Whiting, which had just completed a summer in port at Norfolk, Virginia, and was bound for Boston, Massachusetts, to conduct hydrographic survey operations in New England, paused off Cape May in late July 2001 to search for the wreck.Whiting's survey department approached the project as it would any typical hydrographic survey. Information on snags – obstructions on the ocean bottom that snarl fishing nets and gear – that local recreational fishermen had reported and reports of possible locations of the wreck from divers that had visited it provided Whiting with possible targets for her search. After her crew had prepared a plan for a systematic search, Whiting moved from target cluster to target cluster, mapping the ocean bottom using sidescan sonar. After eight hours of searching, Whiting found the wreck of S-5 directly over one of the suspected targets, made a sonar image of the wreck, and recorded its exact location. Whiting then made several more passes over the wreck to acquire additional images of it at various angles before leaving the scene.


== Museum holdings and displays ==
The portion of S-5's hull plating that General G. W. Goethals removed to permit S-5's crew to escape from the submarine is on exhibit in the National Museum of the United States Navy in the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C.
NOAA donated the sonar data NOAAS Whiting gathered in 2001 during her discovery of the wreck of S-5 to the Submarine Force Library and Museum in Groton, Connecticut, for archiving and display.

Pricasso,"Tim Patch, commonly known by his professional stage name Pricasso, is an Australian artist who is known for using his genitals to paint portraits, landscapes and female nudes.


== Background ==
Patch was born in the United Kingdom. He attended Oakwood Preparatory School in Chichester and then went on to attend Bembridge School on the Isle of Wight. After Bembridge, Patch went on to study at the Portsmouth College of Art and the Royal West of England Academy. Unable to earn a degree in fine arts he attended furniture design courses and became a builder.In 1977 he migrated from the United Kingdom to Australia and from 1978 to 1982 he exhibited woodcarvings and other artworks in art galleries. In 1984 Patch established Hellfire Pottery with his sister, which produced various pottery and ceramic works. In 2002, Patch began work on building a Gaudí-style house and art gallery, and during this same period he began working as a portrait and caricature artist in markets in Queensland.Patch states that he conceived of the idea of painting with his penis in 2005. Inspired after watching Puppetry of the Penis, he drew a smiley face in the back of a urinal with his penis and then decided to attempt it at home using paint. After telling a friend of his work, she had him paint at a 2005 New Year's Eve party on a dare. In 2006, Patch chose the name of ""Pricasso"" – a portmanteau of ""prick"" (a slang term for penis) and ""Picasso"".


== Works and appearances ==
In an interview with Voima, Pricasso said that portrait work is the most challenging type of painting, so he set himself a goal of painting an accurate-looking portrait within 20 minutes. Due to normal paint containing lime, which erodes the skin, Pricasso makes his own water-based paints. Before he begins painting he also covers his penis and buttocks in Vaseline in order to work for several hours without causing irritation to his skin.While art galleries showed little interest in his paintings, Pricasso became a regular attraction at Sexpo exhibitions around the world, where he paints portraits for attendees.Pricasso's appearance at the 2010 Expo Sexo y Entretenimiento México was cancelled after censors from the Mexico City authorities attended the exposition to verify the shows. He made his North American debut at the 2011 Miami Xposed Expo, and signed an agreement to appear exclusively at future Xposed Expo events.In 2008, Pricasso entered a nude self-portrait into the Archibald Prize. His submission came after an unsuccessful entry in the 2007 competition using a portrait of plastic surgeon Joseph Georghy.Pricasso told Fala Fil that, while celebrities tend to be wary of having him paint their portrait, he has painted at private parties for famous individuals after agreeing to not publicise the event. Charlie Murphy was one celebrity who Pricasso noted as approving. Amongst the celebrities he said he painted portraits of are Hugh Hefner, John Howard, Kim Beazley, George W. Bush, Robert Mugabe, Barack Obama, Jacob Zuma, Queen Elizabeth II, Kevin Rudd, Tony Blair, and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.In the latter half of 2010, Pricasso appeared on the 4th season of German TV talent show Das Supertalent. After painting a female portrait on the stage, Sylvie van der Vaart voted down the performance, but he progressed to the next round due to the support of the two male judges on the panel – Dieter Bohlen and Bruce Darnell. In November 2011, Pricasso appeared on Tosh.0, where Daniel Tosh interviewed and commissioned a picture of himself painted by the artist.


== Response to technique ==
Nicholas Chare, in an article titled ""Sexing the Canvas"", has linked Pricasso's work with statements by classic modern painters who referred to the activity of painting as a ""seminal"" or ""spermatic"" activity with sexual connotations.In the lead-up to the 2008 Sexpo in Cape Town, Pricasso published a video online showing him creating a painting of then-Mayor of Cape Town Helen Zille. Although he stated the painting was not meant to insult or embarrass Zille, The Times reported that two art galleries in Johannesburg declined to associate themselves with Pricasso's artwork. The curator of Moja Modern gallery suggested that the ridicule of his work could abate in fifty years time and his painting seen as having broken boundaries in art. Julia Charlton, the senior curator of the Wits Gallery, said that it is not a question of whether it is art, but whether it is ""good art"". Charlton and Pieter van Heerden, the director of the Pretoria Art Institute, stated that how he painted did not determine the artistic nature of his work, with Charlton adding that ""art is not only meant to be pleasant, but provocative, and it should get people talking."" Van Heerden further stated his work is not offensive and that works only become art when they are great. On hearing of Pricasso's painting, Zille stated ""This is a free country. A free society throws up these kinds of people, who exercise their freedom in unusual ways. And if this is how he wants to do it, I must accept his constitutional right to do so."" Zille further commented that Pricasso ""achieved a good likeness and I can't imagine how he painted it without brushes or conventional equipment.""In November 2011, Pricasso participated in the Gold Coast Sculptors' Society Exotic Erotic show. The controversial nature of his technique caused several members of the Society to object to his participation, with one member resigning in protest. Pricasso responded to criticism by saying, ""I think I'm just as good as anyone with a brush and I'm probably a lot quicker ... They can complain if they want to but other people love it.""

Subhani Ba Yunus,"Subhani ba Yunus (1931–2006) was an accomplished Pakistani actor and television and radio personality whose distinct voice quality earned him a special place in Radio Pakistan. Younis was an Urdu-speaking Hyderabadi Muslim of Hadhrami Chaush descent. His claim to fame comes from Khwaja Moinuddin's stage plays, particularly Taleem-e-Balighan in which he played the role of a butcher.
His memorable plays were Lal Qilay Se Lalo Khait Tak, Mohammad Bin Qasim, Karawaan, Qisa Chahar Darwaish, Jungle, Mirza Ghalib Bandar Road Par, Do Duni Panch, Khuda Ki Basti and Tanhaiyaan. His last play for PTV was Ba Adab Ba Mulahiza, after which he virtually retired from his acting career.


== Personal life ==
Subhani Ba Yunus was born Hyderabad Deccan, British India, in 1931. He belonged to a family that had migrated to India from Hadhramaut, Yemen. After partition of India, his family settled in Karachi in August 1949. He had a son and a daughter.


== Career ==
Initially, Subhani Bayunus performed mostly in Khawaja Moinuddin's plays, and it was due to him that he owed his move to PTV. It so happened that after the tremendous success of Khawaja sahib's Lal Qilay Sey Lalukhet Tuk and Taleem-i-Balghaan, the writer was invited to adapt the plays for television. Subhani Bayunus, who had performed important roles in these plays on radio, took on the acting assignments on PTV with equal facility and subsequent success. He managed to carve out a niche for himself on PTV with brilliant performances in plays like Lal Qilay Sey Lalukhet Tuk, Taleem-i-Balghaan, Shama,(he did not took part in Shama it was rather Afshan where he played role of Zartaj's father[the 2nd wife of Mr Mohsin Mumtaz and Afshan's Step mom]) Tanhaiyaan, Tipu Sultan: The Tiger Lord, Khuda Ki Basti, Mera Naam Mangu, Zeenat, Intizar Farmaiye, Janey Do, Insan Aur Aadmi, Ba Adab Ba Mulahiza Hoshiar, Akahri Chataan and Labbaik.He had a knack of playing mystery roles and did a superb job with the lead role of detective Inspector Zuberi in Ali Zafar Jafri's mystery series which was aired on TV and radio. He played character roles in many episodes of NTM's Mystery Theatre which was re-telecast on a private TV channel a couple of years ago. It is said he worked for Ibn-e-Safi as well.
Subhani Bayunus tried his hand in films and performed the role of a villain in Iqbal Akhtar's Nadaan (1973). He played character roles in Athar Shah Khan Jaidi's Aas Paas (1982) and Iqbal Akhtar's comeback failure Muskurahat (1995). He acted in a Gujarati film titled Mann Tey Maan and Javed Jabbar's English-language film Beyond the Last Mountain (1977).
It is said that the Mirza Ghalib role that made Subhani Bayunus a household name in the 1960s was originally given to Mohammad Yousuf. But the renowned man of letters Nazar Hyderabadi insisted that the role be given to Subhani Bayunus whose height and appearance made him bear a striking resemblance to Ghalib. Subhani Bayunus also played Ghalib in a documentary made by the Directorate of Films and Publications in 1968 as part of Ghalib's centenary celebrations.
