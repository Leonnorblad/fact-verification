Greenlandic independence,"Greenlandic independence (Danish: Grønlandsk uafhængighed, Greenlandic: Namminersulivinneq) is a political ambition of some political parties (such as Siumut, Inuit Ataqatigiit, Partii Naleraq, and Nunatta Qitornai), advocacy groups, and individuals of Greenland, an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, to become an independent sovereign state.


== Background ==


=== Norse and Inuit colonization ===
Greenland's present population are predominantly Inuit descended from the Thule people who migrated from the North American mainland in the 13th century AD, gradually colonizing the island. The Danish claim to the island stems from Norse settlement of southern Greenland which lasted from the 980s until the early 15th century.
Scholars believe that the earliest known Norse settlements in Greenland originated from Iceland, and that Erik the Red founded an early colony in 985.  The Kingdom of Norway later claimed and controlled Greenland singularly from roughly 1261–1319.These Norse settlements vanished during the 14th and early 15th centuries, with the Inuit being the sole occupants of the island, expanding to the southern and western coasts, and being de facto independent for over 200 years until Europeans peoples returned. Despite this, a de jure continuing European possession of Greenland was assumed by European peoples.


=== European resettlement in the 18th–20th centuries ===
European contact with Greenland was not re-established until 1721 with the mission of Hans Egede, which was followed by the Moravian missions. These established enduring settlements and—after failing to find the Norse peoples—attempted to Christianize the Inuit.
By this time Norway and Denmark had been unified under Denmark–Norway which considered Greenland part of its territory. This ended on 14 January 1814 after Norway was ceded from Denmark as a result of the Napoleonic Wars in Europe. As a result of the Treaty of Kiel, Denmark resumed full sovereignty over Greenland soon after. From 1814 to 1953, Greenland was a territory, not independent and not part of Denmark, but directly controlled by the Danish government.


=== American protectorate and occupation ===
During the Second World War, Denmark was occupied and controlled by Nazi Germany between 1940 and 1945. As a result, the Danish and US governments signed an agreement to hand over defense and control of Greenland to the United States on 9 April 1941. 
(The Danish government was represented by the Danish ambassador to the US, as the US did not recognize the Nazi government of Denmark). The first troops arrived in Greenland on 7 July 1941. The US built two airports with full-length runways, which as of 2018 still are the main international airports of Greenland; however, they are located far away from any traditional settlement.
Greenland was effectively independent during these years and allowed the United States to build bases on its territory, in spite of the Danish pre-war neutrality. After the war the pre-war situation was restored, the US bases remained and Denmark, with Greenland as a part of the Kingdom, joined NATO.


== Moves towards independence ==
In 1953 a new Danish Constitution incorporated Greenland into Denmark, the island thereby gained representation in the Danish Parliament and was recognized as a Danish province known as the County of Greenland.In 1972, at the request of the Provincial Council, Knud Hertling established a committee of Greenlandic members to study the possibility of increased local power. In 1975, the committee recommended a shift to home rule as quickly as possible. Hertling responded with the creation of a Commission on Home Rule in Greenland with 14 members divided evenly between Greenlandic and Danish representatives. The commission's work submitted its final report in June 1978 with proposals for a Home Rule Act.In 1979 the Danish government granted Greenland home rule, with Denmark keeping control of a number of areas including foreign relations, defense, currency matters and the legal system in Greenland.Greenland's minimal representation in the Danish Folketing meant that, although over 70% of Greenlanders had opposed entry into the European Common Market (EEC), it nevertheless joined in 1973 as part of Denmark. Greenlanders' fears that the customs union would allow foreign firms to compete and overfish its waters were quickly realized. After home rule was secured, a bare majority (53%) of Greenland's population voted on 23 February 1982 to leave the EEC, a process which lasted until 1985. This resulted in the Greenland Treaty of 1985.In 2008 Greenland's citizens approved the Greenlandic self-government referendum with a 75% vote in favor of a higher degree of autonomy. Greenland took control of law enforcement, the coast guard, and the legal system. The official language changed from Danish to Greenlandic on 21 June 2009, Greenland national day. The act gives control of foreign relations of Greenland to the island in trade and other areas it is responsible for. Greenland has representatives in Copenhagen, Brussels, Reykjavik, and Washington, D.C.As part of the self-rule law of 2009 (section §21), Greenland can declare full independence if they wish to pursue it, but it would have to be approved by a referendum among the Greenlandic people. A poll in 2016 showed that there was a clear majority (64%) for full independence among the Greenlandic people, but a poll in 2017 showed that there was a clear opposition (78%) if it meant a fall in living standards.Greenland's former prime minister, Kuupik Kleist, has repeatedly expressed the need to diversify Greenland's economy, which mainly relies on fishery, tourism and a substantial annual block grant from the Danish state. The block grant equals about two-thirds of Greenland's government budget or about one-quarter of the entire GDP of Greenland. Economic stability is seen as a basis for full political independence from Denmark. When Kim Kielsen was reelected  with a strong majority as the leader of the largest Greenlandic pro-independence party Siumut in 2017, observers considered it a win for the ""slow-independence"" faction instead of the ""now-independence"" faction. (His opponent, Vittus Qujaukitsoq, had argued for independence even if it meant losing the large annual block grant from the Danish state.) During a debate in the Danish Parliament (which also includes members from Greenland) in 2018, Danish Prime Minister Lars Løkke said that Greenland needs to make it clear if they wish to remain a part of the Kingdom or become independent. If Greenland were to become an independent country, the annual block grant from Denmark to Greenland would cease.In 2008, independence campaigners touted the year 2021 (the 300th anniversary of Danish colonial rule) as a date for potential independence.In 2023, a commission tasked with drafting a constitution for an independent Greenland presented its proposal.


== Polling ==
A poll in 2016 showed that there was a clear majority (64%) for full independence among the Greenlandic people.A 2019 poll showed that 67.8% of Greenlanders support independence from Denmark sometime in the next two decades.


== In fiction ==
The issue of Greenlandic independence features heavily in the eighth-episode of the Swedish–Icelandic television series Thin Ice (2019–2020). Written by Søren Stærmose and Lena Endre, it was predominately filmed in Greenland at the height of the Greenlandic winter. By the end of the first season, Greenland achieves independence, with covert backing from the United States. The political system of the newly independent Greenland is not given, although the country is shown to have awarded an unnamed American oil company offshore drilling rights to a large deep sea oil deposit.

Prior to European settlement, what is now Jamisontown was home to the Mulgoa people who spoke the Darug language. They lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle governed by traditional laws, which had their origins in the Dreamtime. Their homes were bark huts called 'gunyahs'. They hunted kangaroos and emus for meat, and gathered sweet potatoes, berries and other native plants.


=== European settlement ===
In 1805, the then Surgeon-General (Principal Surgeon) of the Colony of New South Wales, Thomas Jamison (1752/53-1811), was granted 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) on the banks of the Nepean River, to the south of what is now Jamison Road. Later, the property passed to his son, Sir John Jamison (1776–1844), Kt, MD, MLC - a celebrated physician, land owner and political reformer, who erected a splendid mansion (since destroyed by fire) on the nearby Regentville estate during the 1820s.
The land at Jamisontown stayed rural for the next 150 years or so. In 1911, it was the departure point for the first cross-country flight in Australia, made by William Ewart Hart. In the 1960s the area began to be subdivided and developed and in 1976, Jamisontown was officially gazetted as a neighbourhood.Jamison Town Post Office opened on 10 May 1889 and closed in 1931.The sikh locals formed 	 Sydney Gurdwara Penrith (Sikh Association of Australia) as well.

Diana Souhami,"Diana Souhami (born 25 August 1940) is an English writer of biographies, short stories and plays. She is noted for her unconventional biographies of prominent lesbians.


== Biography ==
Souhami was brought up in London and studied philosophy at University of Hull. Before turning to writing biography, she worked in the publications department of the BBC. While there, she published short stories, wrote plays that were performed at Edinburgh Festival, The Kings Head in Islington, and broadcast as radio and television plays by the BBC. She devised an exhibition for the British Council called A Woman's Place: The Changing Picture of Women in Britain, which in 1984 toured 30 countries. Her book based on this exhibition was published by Penguin Books. She also reviewed books and plays for newspapers. In 1986 she was approached by Pandora Press and received a commission to write a biography of the artist Gluck.Her life of Gluck was her only book in which she used a birth-to-death approach until her life of Edith Cavell (2010). ""We don't live our lives or read in a linear fashion. Also, the internet has so much information that it rather absolves the biographer from being a storehouse of knowledge.""Souhami became a full-time writer, publishing biographies which mostly explore the most influential and intriguing of 20th century lesbian (and gay) lives. She followed Gluck (1988), with Gertrude and Alice (1991), an account of the relationship between Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas which lasted from their first meeting to Stein's death in 1946, Greta and Cecil (1994) examining the romantic relationship between Greta Garbo and Cecil Beaton, and Mrs Keppel and her daughter (1996), a dual biography of Alice Keppel, a long-time mistress of King Edward VII, and her daughter, Violet Trefusis. The Trials of Radclyffe Hall (1998), the biography of Marguerite Radclyffe Hall, won the Lambda Literary Award for Biography in 2000 and was shortlisted for the James Tait Black Memorial Prize.In 2001, she departed from her usual genre to publish Selkirk's Island, an account of Alexander Selkirk's years as a castaway on Isla Más a Tierra (now better known as Robinson Crusoe Island) in the Juan Fernández archipelago. Booksellers and librarians had been puzzling whether to classify the book as fact, fiction, faction, fable or fantasy when it won the 2001 Whitbread Biography Award.Returning to lesbian biography, Wild Girls (2004) is another dual biography, this time of the American couple Romaine Brooks and Natalie Barney, part of the artistic expat community in Paris between the wars. Never a conventional biographer, Souhami places at the start of each chapter a short passage in italics where ""she appears to be narrating some of her personal lesbian experiences - waiting in a bar for a blind date, a secret affair with a woman Dean, furtive love-making with a girl on the deck of a Greek ferry at night.""In 2007 Souhami returned to writing about islands with Coconut Chaos, set on and en route to Pitcairn Island. Two stories are intertwined: an investigation into the lives of the HMS Bounty mutineers and their descendants, and a memoir of her journey to the mid-Pacific rock on a freighter with a woman known only as ""Lady Myre"". She visited at the time of the 2004 Pitcairn Islands sexual assault trial, and although she attempted to travel incognito, the Pitcairn Islanders discovered that she was a writer and asked her to leave. This book was dramatised for BBC radio.Edith Cavell (2010) is a straightforward biography of the nurse who was executed for her role in the smuggling of allied soldiers out of Belgium during the First World War.
Murder at Wrotham Hill (2012) is an account of the 1946 murder of Dagmar Petrzywalski and the subsequent investigation and prosecution of the crime, near a quiet village in Kent.
Gwendolen (2014) is a re-telling of George Eliot's novel Daniel Deronda.
Souhami won the 2021 Polari Prize for No Modernism Without Lesbians.""I started writing about lesbians 25 years ago in the hope of contributing to breaking the history of silence. Acceptance can't happen without openness, and I believe we should all try to speak out in our own way. If you're silent and invisible you're no trouble to anyone. You're so buried you're assumed not to be there. So, historically, we have to dig deep to shed light on 'these practices', rid them of insult, turn the wrongdoing around, name and shame the abusers."" (Souhami quoted by Emily Reynolds)

Buccopharyngeal membrane,"The region where the crescentic masses of the ectoderm and endoderm come into direct contact with each other constitutes a thin membrane, the buccopharyngeal membrane (or oropharyngeal membrane), which forms a septum between the primitive mouth and pharynx. In front of the buccopharyngeal area, where the lateral crescents of mesoderm fuse in the middle line, the pericardium is afterward developed, and this region is therefore designated the pericardial area.
The buccopharyngeal membranes serve as a respiratory surface in a wide variety of amphibians and reptiles. In this type of respiration, membranes in the mouth and throat are permeable to oxygen and carbon dioxide. In some species that remain submerged in water for long periods, gas exchange by this route can be significant.

Varaita,"The Varaita (Italian pronunciation: [vaˈraita]; Piedmontese: Vràita [ˈvrɑjta]; Occitan: Varacho [vaˈɾatʃu]) is a 75-kilometre (47 mi) river of the Province of Cuneo in northwest Italy. It is the first right tributary of the Po River.


== Geography ==
The river springs at an elevation of some 2,500 metres (8,200 ft) on the slopes of Monviso, in the Cottian Alps near the French border, then proceeds through the valley named after it—the Valle Varaita—where it passes through centres including Frassino, Sampeyre, Brossasco and Costigliole Saluzzo. Having entered the plains of the Po valley it joins the Po near Casalgrasso.


== Regime ==
The regime is typical of an Alpine torrent: the flow is at its greatest in spring and in autumn while being drastically reduced during the summer. The mean discharge at its confluence with the Po is about 12 cubic metres per second (420 cu ft/s).

"Wellington Square Baptist Church, Hastings","Wellington Square Baptist Church is a Baptist church in the centre of Hastings, a town and seaside resort in East Sussex, England.   It was built in 1838 for a congregation which had previously been meeting for worship in hired premises, and it has been in continuous use since then.  Rev. W. Barker, a long-serving minister in the 19th century, revived the church after it was split by a secession and later helped to establish Baptist chapels in two other parts of Hastings.  The church forms the northwest corner of Wellington Square, one of the town's earliest residential developments, and its stuccoed Neoclassical exterior harmonises with the surrounding houses.  Historic England has listed the church at Grade II* for its architectural and historical importance.


== History ==
The ancient town of Hastings developed rapidly as a popular seaside resort in the first decades of the 19th century, and housing and other facilities quickly spread beyond the confines of the Old Town. Development of Wellington Square began in 1817, two years after the land was bought by the Hastings Bank—a local financial institution owned by Messrs Breeds, Farncomb and Wenham.  Work started in the southeastern corner of the site, initially called Wellington Place, and continued until well into the 1820s.  The lime kilns which had previously occupied the site supplied much of the building material for the houses.A group of friends began to meet for worship in 1836, initially in a hired room in Waterloo Passage near the High Street in Hastings Old Town.  They were supported by the Kent and Sussex Baptist Association. Soon afterwards, shipbuilder Joseph Fletcher moved from London with his ill daughter, whose health improved while in Hastings.  Out of gratitude for this, he paid for the congregation to use the Assembly Rooms at the Swan Hotel for their meetings and for a minister to serve them.  Work started on a permanent chapel building for the congregation using money they had raised for this purpose, and in May 1838 he officially founded the church and the chapel opened.  The three-sided sea-facing Wellington Square had a gap at the western end, and the chapel was built there.Around 1864 a secession occurred which caused Wellington Square's minister at the time to leave and set up a new church, the Memorial Chapel.  This opened on 30 August 1865 but was no longer in use by the time it was sold in 1882.  The secession took away many members of the church and left its membership very low: for a time ""things were in such a bad state"" that it was decided to close and sell the chapel, but under new minister Rev. W. Barker the cause began to prosper again.  Under his ministry the church was responsible for founding a Baptist mission hall in the Halton area of Hastings.  This opened on 12 December 1871 and was formally registered for worship between March 1890 and December 1947.  A new church, Halton Baptist Church, was registered in April 1957 and remains in use.  Similarly, a few years after the original church at Halton was founded, members of the chapel carried out ministry in the neighbouring resort of St Leonards-on-Sea with the aim of establishing a Baptist church there, and one was formed in 1881.  St Leonard's Baptist Church was built in 1882–83 and opened the following year.  In about 1875 Barker was also made responsible for a struggling Baptist chapel at New Romney in Kent.  By 1887 attendances had risen, the building had been enlarged and a mission pastor had been employed to help.The chapel was closed for some time during early 1873 while the building and its schoolrooms were repaired and altered at a cost of £300.  It reopened on 26 June 1873.   Further alterations were carried out five years later to the design of local architect Thomas Elworthy and at a cost of £750: two additional galleries were installed and the existing one was extended, and new fittings were installed.Wellington Square Baptist Church remains in use for worship and by a wide range of community groups.  It is one of three surviving church buildings opened in the first half of the 19th century in Hastings, and the only one still in religious use: the others are the former Ebenezer Particular Baptist Chapel (1817) and the former Church of St Mary-in-the-Castle (1828).  The chapel was listed at Grade II* by English Heritage, the predecessor of Historic England, on 19 January 1951.  This defines it as a ""particularly important"" building of ""more than special interest"".  As of February 2001, it was one of 13 Grade II* listed buildings, and 535 listed buildings of all grades, in the borough of Hastings.


== Architecture ==
The chapel was designed as an integral part of Wellington Square, an ""ambitious"" three-sided square of stuccoed houses.  Along with nearby Pelham Square it is one of ""the two principal planned developments of early 19th-century Hastings"".  The chapel is also stuccoed and is in the Neoclassical style.  It has  tall arched windows and a moulded cornice with a parapet, behind which is set the hipped slate roof.  The main elevation faces into the square and has five bays, each with an arched sash window set in a ""giant"" arched recess.  A projecting round-arched porch is in the right-hand (north-eastern) bay.  The side (south) elevation has three bays, the middle of which projects slightly and is topped by a shallow pediment.  Below this is a large arched recess.  The side bays have tall arched sash windows with smaller windows below.  At ground-floor level is a projecting porch with a side entrance, central window and two pairs of plain pilasters.The chapel was built on top of a schoolroom and lecture room.  The school moved to a new building at Bourne Walk at some point between 1868 and 1876.


== Administration ==
The church is registered for worship in accordance with the Places of Worship Registration Act 1855; its number on the register is 56902.  Under the name Baptist Chapel it was registered for the solemnisation of marriages in accordance with the Marriage Act 1836 on 8 May 1841.  The church is part of the East Sussex Network of the South Eastern Baptist Association, one of 13 regional divisions within Baptists Together (the Baptist Union of Great Britain).

"Limon, Colorado","Limon is a statutory town that is the most populous municipality in Lincoln County, Colorado, United States. The population was 2,043 at the 2020 United States Census. Limon lies at the intersection of Interstate 70 and U.S. Highways 24, 40, 71, and 287. The Limon Correctional Facility is part of the Colorado Department of Corrections system and is a major employer in the area with employment of roughly 350.
Limon is the western terminus of the Kyle Railroad and it is here the regional interchanges with the Union Pacific Railroad. Trains previously stopped at Limon Railroad Depot.


== History ==
Railroads were the major factor for Limon's original founding and location. The Kansas Pacific Railroad made its way across the plains from southern Kansas following the Smoky Hill Trail in 1870. In 1888, the Chicago, Rock Island, and Pacific Railroad (now the Kyle Railroad) made its way west to east from Colorado Springs, entering Lincoln County and intersected the Kansas Pacific (now Union Pacific) at the present day location of Limon. This union of the two railroads was the earliest founding of the ""Hub City"".


=== Porter lynching ===
Limon was the site of a lynching on November 16, 1900. Preston Porter Jr, a sixteen-year-old African-American male, had confessed under duress to the murder of eleven-year-old Louise Frost who was Caucasian. Porter was apparently being held some 90 miles away in Denver, but was sent back to Limon by request of unspecified people and against the wishes of Sheriff Freeman. When the train carrying Porter stopped in Limon, sixteen men selected from a mob of 300 ""marked by calmness and determination"" took Porter from Freeman's custody despite the sheriff's protestations ""in the name of law."" Originally it was announced that Porter would be hanged but many in the crowd including R. W. Frost, the girl's father, objected ""that such a death would be too easy."" The method was left to Frost who decided upon burning at the stake. Frost also refused to allow mutilation of Porter's body before burning. While waiting for his execution, Porter sat next to a bonfire reading the Gospel of Luke from the Bible. Porter was chained to an iron railroad rail set in the ground on the exact spot where the murder had taken place and burned to death, the match to start the fire being set by the girl's father. Lynchings of this type were apparently rare, as reporters on the scene wrote: ""The general sentiment expressed approves the execution of the negro, but deprecates the method adopted.""


=== 1990 tornado ===
On June 6, 1990, an F3 tornado touched down near Matheson (about 16 miles west of Limon), tearing roughly east-northeast through fields. Minutes later, the then rain-wrapped tornado arrived, devastating the city. The storm injured 14 people, but remarkably no one was killed. Most of Limon's business district had been laid to ruins in just moments.
Governor Roy Romer declared Limon a disaster area the next day.Limon successfully rebuilt its business district adding streetscaping, a new Town Hall, relocating a medical clinic and Limon Memorial Library, creating Hub City Senior Center and a new fire station.  Downtown Limon is now a thriving center of the community demonstrating the strength of this rural community.

University of Parma,"The University of Parma (Italian: Università degli Studi di Parma, UNIPR) is a public university in Parma, Emilia-Romagna, Italy. It is organised in nine departments. As of 2016 the University of Parma has about 26,000 students.


== History ==
During the 13th-14th centuries there was an educational institution, studium, in Parma, but it was closed in 1387 by Gian Galeazzo Visconti, Duke of Milan. The university was opened in 1412 by Niccolò III d'Este, and, although no papal bull was issued, the degrees were granted. In 1420 Filippo Maria Visconti closed it again.Although there were several attempts to revive the university, it functioned only as a ""paper university"", granting degrees without teaching. In 1601, the university was finally reopened by Ranuccio I Farnese, and the papal bill was given. It was a joint institution with a Society of Jesus, and a third of staff were teachers from a local Jesuit school, who taught in a separate building and by Jesuit curriculum. There were usually about 27-32 teachers and 300-400 students in the 17th century. Logic, natural history, mathematics and theology were taught by Jesuits and law and medicine by civil teachers. Among the most important Jesuits who taught in Parma should be mentioned Giovanni Battista Riccioli, and Daniello Bartoli.In 1768, Ferdinand I expelled Jesuits and the curriculum was modernized. Student protests resulted in closure of the university by Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma, in 1831; only in 1854 did Louise Marie Thérèse of Artois re-open it. The university then comprised faculties of theology, law, medicine, physics and mathematics, philosophy, and literature, as well as schools of obstetrics, pharmacy, and veterinary medicine.After the Risorgimento, the government of newly united Italy divided the universities of the country into two grades. In 1862, the University of Parma was declared grade B, its financing was reduced, and the quality of education degraded. It was equalized with grade A universities only in 1887.

Tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activation,"Tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activation is a method of inducible gene expression where transcription is reversibly turned on or off in the presence of the antibiotic tetracycline or one of its derivatives (e.g. doxycycline).Tetracycline-controlled gene expression is based upon the mechanism of resistance to tetracycline antibiotic treatment found in gram-negative bacteria. In nature, the Ptet promoter expresses TetR (the repressor) and TetA, the protein that pumps tetracycline antibiotic out of the cell.The difference between Tet-On and Tet-Off is not whether the transactivator turns a gene on or off, as the name might suggest; rather, both proteins activate expression. The difference relates to their respective response to tetracycline or doxycycline (Dox, a more stable tetracycline analogue); Tet-Off activates expression in the absence of Dox, whereas Tet-On activates in the presence of Dox.


== Tet-Off and Tet-On ==
The two most commonly used inducible expression systems for research of eukaryote cell biology are named Tet-Off and Tet-On. 
The Tet-Off system for controlling expression of genes of interest in mammalian cells was developed by Professors Hermann Bujard and Manfred Gossen at the University of Heidelberg and first published in 1992.The Tet-Off system makes use of the tetracycline transactivator (tTA) protein, which is created by fusing one protein, TetR (tetracycline repressor), found in Escherichia coli bacteria, with the activation domain of another protein, VP16, found in the herpes simplex virus.The resulting tTA protein is able to bind to DNA at specific TetO operator sequences. In most Tet-Off systems, several repeats of such TetO sequences are placed upstream of a minimal promoter such as the CMV promoter. The entirety of several TetO sequences with a minimal promoter is called a tetracycline response element (TRE), because it responds to binding of the tetracycline transactivator protein tTA by increased expression of the gene or genes downstream of its promoter.
In a Tet-Off system, expression of TRE-controlled genes can be repressed by tetracycline and its derivatives. They bind tTA and render it incapable of binding to TRE sequences, thereby preventing transactivation of TRE-controlled genes.
A Tet-On system works similarly, but in the opposite fashion. While in a Tet-Off system, tTA is capable of binding the operator only if not bound to tetracycline or one of its derivatives, such as doxycycline, in a Tet-On system, the rtTA protein is capable of binding the operator only if bound by a tetracycline. Thus the introduction of doxycycline to the system initiates the transcription of the genetic product. The Tet-On system is sometimes preferred over Tet-Off for its faster responsiveness.
Tet-Off expression systems are also used in generating transgenic mice which conditionally express gene of interest.


== Tet-On Advanced and Tet-On 3G ==
The Tet-On Advanced transactivator (also known as rtTA2S-M2) is an alternative version of Tet-On that shows reduced basal expression, and functions at a 10-fold lower Dox concentration than Tet-Off. In addition, its expression is considered to be more stable in eukaryotic cells due to being human codon optimized and utilizing three minimal transcriptional activation domains. It was discovered in 2000 as one of two improved mutants by H. Bujard and his colleagues after random mutagenesis of the Tet repressor part of the transactivator gene. Tet-On 3G (also known as rtTA-V10 ) is similar to Tet-On Advanced but was derived from rtTA2S-S2 rather than rtTA2S-M2. It is also human codon optimized and composed of three minimal VP16 activation domains. However, the Tet-On 3G protein has five amino acid differences compared to Tet-On Advanced which appear to increase its sensitivity to Dox even further. Tet-On 3G is sensitive to 100-fold less Dox and is seven-fold more active than the original Tet-On.


== Other systems ==
Other systems such as the T-REx system by Life Technologies work in a different fashion. The gene of interest is flanked by an upstream CMV promoter and two TetO2 sites. Expression of the gene of interest is repressed by the high affinity binding of TetR homodimers to each TetO2 sequences in the absence of tetracycline. Introduction of tetracycline results in binding of one tetracycline on each TetR homodimer followed by release of TetO2 by the TetR homodimers. Unbinding of TetR homodimers and TetO2 result in derepression of the gene of interest.
A modified version of T-REx is the Linearizer synthetic biological circuit, optimized for gene expression tuning in eukaryotic (budding yeast, human, etc) cells. By incorporating TetO2 sites into the promoter driving TetR expression, it creates negative feedback, which ensures homogeneous expression (low noise) and a linear dose-response to tetracycline analogs. 


== Tetracycline response element (TRE) ==
In the most commonly used plasmids, the tetracycline response element consists of seven repeats of the 19bp bacterial TetO sequence ( TCCCTATCAGTGATAGAGA ) separated by spacer sequences (for example: ACGATGTCGAGTTTAC). It is the TetO that is recognized and bound by the TetR portion of Tet-On or Tet-Off. The TRE is usually placed upstream of a minimal promoter that has very low basal expression in the absence of bound Tet-Off (or Tet-On).


== Advantages and disadvantages ==
The Tet system has advantages over Cre, FRT, and ER (estrogen receptor) conditional gene expression systems. In the Cre and FRT systems, activation or knockout of the gene is irreversible once recombination is accomplished, whereas, in Tet and ER systems, it is reversible. The Tet system has very tight control on expression, whereas ER system is somewhat leaky. However, the Tet system, which depends on transcription and subsequent translation of a target gene, is not as fast-acting as the ER system, which stabilizes the already-expressed target protein upon hormone administration. Also, since the 19bp tet-o sequence is naturally absent from mammalian cells, pleiotropy is thought to be minimized compared to hormonal methods of control. When using the Tet system in cell culture, it is important to confirm that each batch of fetal bovine serum is tested to confirm that contaminating tetracyclines are absent or are too low to interfere with inducibility.
The mechanism of action for the antibacterial effect of tetracyclines relies on disrupting protein translation in bacteria, thereby damaging the ability of microbes to grow and repair; however protein translation is also disrupted in eukaryotic mitochondria leading to effects that may confound experimental results.

Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Saxony,"The Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Saxony (Evangelisch-Lutherische Landeskirche Sachsens) is one of 20 member Churches of the Protestant Church in Germany (EKD), covering most of the state of Saxony. Its headquarters are in Dresden, and the seat of the bishop (styled Bishop of Saxony) is at Meissen Cathedral. Prior to the propagation of state atheism in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), it was the largest Evangelical Lutheran church in Germany.The church has 610,503 parishioners in 319 parishes (as of December 31, 2022).


== History ==
Historically, the church's organisation became an example for other Protestant churches to be founded throughout Europe, the so-called ""Saxon model"" of a church as introduced by Martin Luther. It was closely tied to the state, whereby the Elector of Saxony protected the evangelical faith in his jurisdiction. Since the Reformation, the Lutheran orthodoxy (the ""purest form"" of Lutheranism) prevailed among the general population in Saxony and was secured first by its Ernestine and later Albertine Wettin rulers. Beginning in the 17th century, Pietism also gained a significant following, especially among the working class.
In 2019, Carsten Rentzing, bishop of the church since 2015, resigned his position after controversy arose about his connections to far-right parties and groups.

Riverview Park Plat Historic District,"The Riverview Park Plat Historic District is located in the north-central section of Des Moines, Iowa, United States.  It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1996.


== History ==
In 1886 the Riverview Park Company bought two tracts of land from Wesley and Anne Redhead, who had owned the property for a number of years as an investment.  The purchase price was $12,500.  There was a great deal of real estate development in Des Moines at this time.  However, their expectations were greater than the market.  While the lots were expensive, the eight lots on the north side with their panoramic vistas of the Des Moines River sold quickly.  The lots south of Arlington Avenue sold more slowly.  In 1891 lot 13 was further divided into three lots and was named Jackson's Subdivision.  Two years later lots 9 and 10 were subdivided into 13 lots and renamed Arlington Place.
Riverview Park Plat was intended to be an upscale development.  Lot owners who wanted to sell their property were required to offer the lots, or their shares of stock in the company, to those who had already invested in the development. If no one made an offer then the lot owner could place the property on the open market.  Riverview Park is the earliest known example of a restrictive residential covenant in Des Moines.Large houses were in fact built in the upper and upper-middle-class neighborhood.  Until the 1960s only a few of the houses had been converted from single family to multi-family dwellings.  As the homes continued to age they also deteriorated and more were converted into multi-family housing.  In the 1980s the neighborhood was classified as slum-blight by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.


== Architecture ==
The Riverview Park Plat Historic District includes some of the largest architecturally ambitious houses in Des Moines at that time.  The Queen Anne and Colonial Revival were the predominant architectural styles employed.  There were also examples of eclectic architecture that combined the Colonial Revival, American Four Square, Tudor Revival and American Craftsman styles.  Several of Des Moines’ architectural firms Liebbe, Nourse & Rasmussen, Wetherell and Gage, C. C. Cross & Company and Hallett and Rawson, had their designs built in Riverview
Riverview Park Plat was one of several naturalistic suburban subdivisions that were developed in Des Moines during the 1880s.  Frank Pelton, civil engineer of Des Moines, laid out the plat.  Its focus is the curve of the Des Moines River.  Arlington Avenue follows a curvilinear course that parallels the river.  It also contained an island park, which no longer exists.  The street's width also adds to the park-like nature of the area.  It is 75 feet (23 m) wide while most of Des Moines’ streets at the time were 50 feet (15 m) wide.

113 Battalion,"113 Battalion was a motorised infantry unit of the South African Army.


== History ==


=== Origin of the black battalions ===
By the late 1970s the South African government had abandoned its opposition to arming black soldiers.In early 1979, the government approved a plan to form a number of regional African battalions, each with a particular ethnic identity, which would serve in their homeland or under regional SADF commands.


=== Development of the Gazankulu Defence Force ===
This led to the formation of 113 Battalion for the Tsongas tribe. It is believed that the original intention was for this battalion to form the basis of a future Gazankulu Defence Force.
113 Battalion was raised in 1980 at Phalaborwa in the then Eastern Transvaal.
Troops for 113 SA Battalion were recruited from the self-governing territory of Gazankulu.


=== Higher Command ===
113 Battalion resorted under the command of Group 13.
64 soldiers from 113 Battalion was transferred to 116 Battalion when that unit was expanded.


=== Disbandment ===
113 Battalion was later absorbed into 7 South African Infantry Battalion to form a single battalion in the new SANDF.

Mimetic theory,"The mimetic theory of desire, an explanation of human behavior and culture, originated with the French historian, literary critic, and philosopher of social science René Girard (1923–2015). The name of the theory derives from the philosophical concept mimesis, which carries a wide range of meanings. In mimetic theory, mimesis refers to human desire, which Girard thought was not linear but the product of a mimetic process in which people imitate models who endow objects with value. Girard called this phenomenon ""mimetic desire"", and described mimetic desire as the foundation of his theory:""Man is the creature who does not know what to desire, and he turns to others in order to make up his mind. We desire what others desire because we imitate their desires.""Mimetic theory posits that mimetic desire leads to natural rivalry and eventually to scapegoating - Girard called this the scapegoat mechanism. In his study of history, Girard formed the hypothesis that societies unify their imitative desires around the destruction of a collectively agreed-upon scapegoat.

Ozark Highlands (ecoregion),"The Ozark Highlands is a Level III ecoregion designated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in four U.S. states. Most of the region is within Missouri, with a part in Arkansas and small sections in Oklahoma and Kansas. It is the largest subdivision of the region known as the Ozark Mountains, less rugged in comparison to the Boston Mountains in Arkansas, the highest part of the Ozarks.
The Ozark Highlands ecoregion has been subdivided into eleven Level IV ecoregions, seven of which lie completely within Missouri.


== Level IV ecoregions ==


=== Springfield Plateau (39a) ===
The Springfield Plateau is the only Ozark Highland Level IV ecoregion within all four states. The nearly level to rolling Springfield Plateau is underlain by cherty limestone of the Mississippian Boone Formation and Burlington Limestone; it is less rugged and wooded than Ecoregions 38, 39b, and 39c, and lacks the Ordovician dolomite and limestone of Ecoregions 39c and 39d. Karst features, such as sinkholes and caves, are common. Cold, perennial, spring-fed streams occur. Upland potential natural vegetation is primarily oak–hickory and also oak–hickory–pine forests; savannas and tallgrass prairies also occurred and were maintained by fire. Today, most of the forest and almost all of the prairie have been replaced by agriculture or expanding residential areas. Poultry, cattle, and hog farming are primary land uses; pastureland and hayland are common. Application of poultry litter to agricultural fields is a non-point source that can impair water quality. Total suspended solids and turbidity values in streams are usually low, but total dissolved solids and hardness values are high. The region is a total of 4,110 square miles (10,600 km2), with 66% in Missouri, 23% in Arkansas, 11% in Oklahoma, and the remainder (53 square miles (140 km2)) in Kansas.


=== Dissected Springfield Plateau–Elk River Hills (39b) ===
The Dissected Springfield Plateau–Elk River Hills are underlain by cherty limestone of the Mississippian Boone Formation and contain many karst features. Cold, perennial, spring-fed streams occur. It is more rugged and wooded than the lithologically similar Springfield Plateau and the lithologically dissimilar Central Plateau. Potential natural vegetation is oak–hickory and oak–hickory–pine forests. Shortleaf pine grows on the thin, cherty soils of steep slopes, and is more common than in Ecoregion 39a, 39c, and 39d. Scattered limestone glades occur, but are less extensive than on the dolomites of the lithologically distinct Ecoregion 39c. Today, Ecoregion 39b remains dominated by forest and woodland. Logging, livestock farming, woodland grazing, recreation, quarrying, and housing are primary land uses. The region is a total of 4,110 square miles (10,600 km2), with 50% in Arkansas, 37% in Missouri, and the balance in Oklahoma.


=== White River Hills (39c) ===
The forested White River Hills ecoregion is a highly dissected portion of the Salem Plateau that is underlain by cherty Ordovician dolomite and limestone. Soils are usually thin, rocky, steep, and nonarable. Flat land is uncommon except along the White River. Ecoregion 39c is lithologically unlike another highly dissected portion of the Ozarks, Ecoregion 39b, where Mississippian cherty limestone of the Boone Formation predominates. Clear, cold, perennial, spring-fed streams are common, but dry valleys occur. Potential natural vegetation is oak–hickory forest, oak–hickory–pine forest, and cedar glades. Glades are more extensive than elsewhere in Arkansas, and occur on thin, droughty soils derived from carbonates. Pine is most common on steep, thin, cherty soils. It includes Table Rock Lake, Bull Shoals Lake, Lake Norfork, and Beaver Lake. Turbidity and total suspended solids are usually low in its streams and rivers, but total dissolved solids and hardness values are high. The ecoregion covers 4,739 square miles (12,270 km2) within Arkansas and Missouri, with 73% in Missouri.


=== Central Plateau (39d) ===
The Central Plateau is an undulating to hilly portion of the Salem Plateau that is dominated by agriculture. Ecoregion 39d is largely underlain by cherty Ordovician dolomite and limestone; it is lithologically distinct from another slightly dissected part of the Ozarks, the Springfield Plateau. Karst features occur. The Central Plateau is less rugged and wooded than Ecoregions 38, 39b, and 39c. Natural vegetation is oak–hickory forest, oak–hickory–pine forest (often on soils derived from sandstone), barrens (on thin soils), and scattered cedar glades (on shallow, rocky, droughty soils from dolomite or limestone). Today, pastureland, hayland, and housing are common, but remnant forests and savannas occur in steeper areas. Turbidity, total suspended solids, total dissolved solids, and hardness values are often higher than in Ecoregions 39a and 39c. The largest Level IV ecoregion, it covers 9,454 square miles (24,490 km2) within Arkansas and Missouri, with 72% in Missouri.


=== Osage/Gasconade Hills (39e) ===
The Osage/Gasconade Hills ecoregion is more densely forested and dissected than the lower relief Central Plateau to the south. Steep slopes and narrow ridges of carbonate and sandstone underlie soils which are rocky and thin. Outcrops of Gasconade Formation with some sandstone are found throughout the region along with areas of Roubidoux Formation, Jefferson City-Cotter dolomites and scattered Mississippian limestone outliers in the western portion. Numerous caves, springs, calcareous wet meadows, losing streams, and streams with entrenched valley meanders are common. Streams flow generally northward and drain into the Missouri River. The potential natural vegetation is predominantly mixed oak forest, with oak-pine forest and some pine forests in the southeast areas of the region and some small limestone and sandstone glades. The northeastern edges of this region are transitional and blend into the Interior River Valleys and Hills ecoregion. The region covers 5,040 square miles (13,100 km2) within Missouri.


=== St. Francois Knobs and Basins (39f) ===
The St. Francois Knobs and Basins ecoregion contains the oldest geologic formations in the state and has a different landscape than surrounding regions. The igneous bedrock knobs of Precambrian granite, rhyolite, and intermediate rocks rise 200–900 feet (61–274 m) above the intervening basins which are underlain by Cambrian sedimentary rocks, primarily carbonate with some sandstone. This is the only region within the Ozark Highlands that generally lacks karst topography. Streams are smaller than in neighboring regions but have a greater fall distance because of the steep topography. Sedimentary-derived soils may be stone free, not cherty as in neighboring regions. The soil mantle is generally shallow with low fertility, except in the basins, which have a thicker, more loamy layer. The potential natural vegetation includes scrub oak, post oak, and blackjack oak forests and glade areas, along with prairie in the basins and valleys. Most of the region is in forest and woodland, with cleared land limited to the small basin-like valleys used for pasture and limited cropland. Lead mining has been an important activity in this region for over two centuries and significant scarification has occurred. Other mineral resources include granite and, to a limited extent, silver, copper, and cobalt, by-products of lead mining. The region covers 1,590 square miles (4,100 km2) within Missouri.


=== Meramec River Hills (39g) ===
The Meramec River Hills ecoregion is deeply dissected, with steep-sided hills and chert-covered ridges. The hills tend to be more rugged than in the Osage/Gasconade Hills ecoregion to the northwest. Land use is mainly timber and recreation, with some pastureland for grazing, and barite and iron mining in the southeast. The potential natural vegetation in this region is shortleaf pine-oak forest and woodland, with a greater oak concentration than in forests of the Current River Hills to the south. Streams in this region drain northeast into the Mississippi River. The region covers 1,776 square miles (4,600 km2) within Missouri.


=== Current River Hills (39h) ===
In many ways, the physiography of the Current River Hills ecoregion is similar to that of the Meramec River Hills to the north. However, this region has many endemic species not found in other Ozark regions and the potential natural vegetation here has a greater pine concentration than in regions to the north and west. The region underwent intensive timber cutting in the early decades of the twentieth century. It now sustains major recreational activities. The stream valleys contain numerous, large, high-quality springs and water quality is generally better than elsewhere in Missouri. Caves and losing streams are common. Streams drain southeast into the Mississippi River. The region covers 3,114 square miles (8,070 km2) within Missouri.


=== Eastern Ozark Border (39i) ===
The Eastern Ozark Border ecoregion is a transitional area between the interior ecoregions of the Ozark Highlands and the Interior River Valleys and Hills ecoregion to the east. Moderately dissected hills and sheer bluffs typify the region. Soils can be rocky and thin on steep slopes, with areas of claypan or loess similar to the Black River Hills Border to the southwest. Compared to the Central Plateau, however, the loess mantle in this region tends to be deeper and more expansive on the uplands. Potential natural vegetation is a mix of oak forest, savanna, glades, and prairies. Land cover is variable with forests, woodlands, and cleared areas in cropland and pasture. This ecoregion has more cropland agriculture than adjoining Ozark regions. The region covers 1,835 square miles (4,750 km2) within Missouri.


=== Black River Hills Border (39j) ===
The Black River Hills Border is a transitional region with broad, flat inter-stream divides and moderately dissected hills. There is significantly less relief than in neighboring hill regions in the Ozark Highlands but greater relief than in the southeastern Mississippi Alluvial Plain. Soils are thin and rocky on steeper slopes, with claypan and loess in more level areas. More soils are derived from sandstone and loess, in contrast to interior Ozark Highlands regions which have soils mainly derived from dolomite. Potential natural vegetation is a mix between Ozark species on uplands and Mississippi Alluvial Plain species in river bottoms. Land cover is predominantly forest and woodland with a scattering of pastureland and cropland in the cleared valley bottoms. This region has the highest precipitation in the Ozark Highlands with 44–46 inches (110–120 cm) per year. The region covers 1,076 square miles (2,790 km2) within Missouri.


=== Prairie Ozark Border (39k) ===
The Prairie Ozark Border ecoregion shares characteristics with both the Wooded Osage Plains and adjacent regions within the Ozark Highlands. Topography is mostly smooth to gently sloping plains, and soils, derived from loess and cherty limestone, tend to support more cropland than other Ozark regions. The area shares the same bedrock, Mississippian to the north, and Ordovician to the south, as nearby Ozark regions. Streambeds are generally rocky and tend to be more Ozarkian in structure than those found in the Wooded Osage Plains to the west. The biotic composition and potential natural vegetation reflect the transition from a predominantly prairie landscape in the northwest to a more wooded landscape of the interior Ozark Highlands. The region covers 842 square miles (2,180 km2) within Missouri.

Oliver Stevens,"Oliver Stevens (1825–1905) was an American attorney and politician who served as District Attorney of Suffolk County, Massachusetts, from 1875 to 1905 and as president of the Boston Common Council in 1856 and 1857.


== Early life ==
Stevens was born on June 22, 1825, in North Andover, Massachusetts, to Isaac Stevens and Hannah Stevens (née Cummings). He was a member of one of North Andover's founding families. His older brother, Isaac Stevens, was the first Governor of Washington Territory and a Union Army General who was killed during the battle of Battle of Chantilly. Stevens grew up on the family farm, which supplied dairy to be sold in Lawrence, Massachusetts.Stevens prepared for college at the North Yarmouth Academy and graduated from Bowdoin College in 1848. He studied law at Harvard Law School and in the office of H. H. Fuller. He was admitted to the bar in 1850.


== Personal life ==
Stevens moved to Boston in 1850, but continued to utilize his family home in North Andover as a summer home. Stevens was a Unitarian and attended the church of Edward Everett Hale. In 1854, he married a cousin, Catherine Stevens of Andover, Massachusetts. They had no children. On September 2, 1895, Stevens and his wife were severely injured when they were ejected from their carriage. Stevens fractured several of his ribs, and Catherine Stevens broke two bones in her right leg and suffered injuries to her hip and chest.


== Early political career ==
Stevens served on the Boston common council from ward 4 in 1856 and 1857 and was president of the body in both years.Stevens was a delegate to the 1860 Democratic National Conventions in Charleston and Baltimore, where he supported the candidacy of Stephen A. Douglas. After the first convention, sixteen members of the Massachusetts delegation, including Caleb Cushing, Benjamin Butler, James Scollay Whitney, and George B. Loring, broke with the party and participated in the “Breckinridge convention"". At the Baltimore convention, Stevens served as the spokesman for the Massachusetts delegation, which supported the eventual nominee – Stephen A. Douglas.


== District attorney ==
In 1874, Stevens was elected District Attorney of Suffolk County. In 1876, he tried Thomas W. Piper, also known as The Boston Belfry Murderer, for the murder of Mabel H. Young. The trial ended in a hung jury, with nine voting to convict and three voting to acquit. Piper was later tried and convicted by Massachusetts Attorney General Charles R. Train.On March 1, 1882, Stevens, under instruction from Massachusetts attorney general George Marston, wrote to James R. Osgood & Co. informing them that their 1881 printing of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass violated the law against obscene literature and requesting that they withdraw it from circulation. On March 23, Osgood & Co. wrote to Whitman that if two poems – ""A Woman Waits for Me"" and ""Ode to a Common Prostitute"", were removed, the government would allow the book to be published. Whitman rejected this request and Osgood & Co., not wanting to get involved with a lawsuit, ceased publishing the book and turned over the plates to Whitman. Rees, Welsh, & Co. (which was soon acquired by David McKay Publications) of Philadelphia agreed to publish the Leaves of Grass  and the controversy surrounding the book made it a financial success.By January 1905, Stevens was unable to do much work due to rheumatism. He spent the entire summer at his farm in North Andover. On July 31, 1905, Stevens resigned effective to the confirmation of his successor. On August 2, Stevens' first assistant Michael J. Sughrue was appointed by Governor William Lewis Douglas and immediately confirmed by the Massachusetts Governor's Council. Stevens died on August 23, 1905, at his home in North Andover.

The AP's panel of sportswriters selected Northern Illinois, who finished the regular season at 9–0 including three shutouts. The Huskies went on to defeat Southwest Missouri State in the Mineral Water Bowl, 21–14.
After the season ended, the NCAA announced plans to play ""four postseason regional games"" in 1964. These were played from 1964 through 1972. However, not until 1973, when the NCAA College Division was reorganized as NCAA Division II and NCAA Division III, did these postseason games to determine a national champion.

The Best of Nek: L'anno zero,"The Best of Nek: L'anno zero is the first greatest hits album by Italian singer-songwriter Nek, released on 10 October 2003.


== Background ==
This album includes the best hits of ten years' career of Nek. Album also includes two new tracks: ""Almeno stavolta"" and ""L'anno zero"". Three tracks, ""In te"", ""Cuori in tempesta"" and ""Angeli nel ghetto"", has been released in new versions. Track ""Sei solo tu"", like in its studio album Le cose da difendere, has been released without vocal of Laura Pausini.
Although the album and single ""Almeno stavolta"" were released in October of the same year, the national, European and Latin American tour were held in 2004, after two years of live performance inactivity. Nek called the album ""l'anno zero"" (in English: ""year zero"") as it marks the end of a period in his career, not only because he matured and found more than ever how music can influence people's thinking, but felt dissatisfaction with his then on-going commercialization of career, with many and dinamic concerts to reduce the intimate relationship between the artist and the audience. At the time of the year or two of public inactivity, he traveled all over the world, especially on the Americas.The song ""Almeno stavolta"" was a highly popular song, it peaked at number five on the charts and remained in the Top 10 for 12 weeks.


== Reception ==
The album is generally positively received. Marisa Brown, of Allmusic, said that it begins with, at the time, ""two new tracks, ""Almeno Stavolta"" and ""L'Anno Zero,"" but then moves immediately into a chronological overview of Nek's repertoire, beginning with his first single, ""In Te,"" which he presented at Sanremo in 1993, and going all the way to ""Cielo e Terra,"" which appeared on his 2002 album, Le cose da difendere"". Brown, who gave the album a four out of five stars rating, concluded that the new ""bonus tracks, while both good and very much in the vein of what Nek has done and continues to do in the 21st century, might not be enough to warrant a purchase for someone who already owns all his other albums"", ""but for someone who's heard the singles and wants a more comprehensive understanding of the artist, it is a very good buy"".

HMPNGS Salamaua,"HMPNGS Salamaua is a Balikpapan-class heavy landing craft operated by the Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF). Prior to 1974, the vessel was called HMAS Salamaua (L 131) and was operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).


== Design and construction ==

The eight-vessel Balikpapan class was ordered as a locally manufactured replacement for the Australian Army's LSM-1-class landing ship medium and ALC 50 landing craft. They are 44.5 metres (146 ft) long, with a beam of 10.1 metres (33 ft), and a draught of 1.9 metres (6 ft 3 in). The landing craft have a standard displacement of 316 tons, with a full load displacement of 503 tons.  They are propelled by two G.M. Detroit 6-71 diesel motors, providing 675 brake horsepower to the two propeller shafts, allowing the vessels to reach 9 knots (17 km/h; 10 mph). The standard ship's company is 13-strong. The Balikpapans are equipped with a Decca RM 916 navigational radar, and fitted with two 7.62 millimetres (0.300 in) machine guns for self-defence.The LCHs have a maximum payload of 180 tons; equivalent to 3 Leopard 1 tanks, 13 M113 armored personnel carriers 23 quarter-tonne trucks, or four LARC-V amphibious cargo vehicles. As a troop transport, a Balikpapan-class vessel can transport up to 400 soldiers between a larger amphibious ship and the shore, or embark 60 soldiers in six-berth caravans for longer voyages. The vessel's payload affects the range: at 175 tons of cargo, each vessel has a range of 1,300 nautical miles (2,400 km; 1,500 mi), which increases to 2,280 nautical miles (4,220 km; 2,620 mi) with a 150-ton payload, and 3,000 nautical miles (5,600 km; 3,500 mi) when unladen. The flat, box-like keel causes the ships to roll considerably in other-than-calm conditions, limiting their ability to make long voyages.Salamaua was laid down Walkers Limited at Maryborough, Queensland on 29 May 1972, launched on 27 July 1972, and commissioned into the RAN on 19 October 1973.


== Operational history ==
Salamaua was transferred to the Papua New Guinea Defence Force on 14 November 1974. She was in active service as of 2013.  She was retired on June 19, 2020.

Anti-Zionist League in Iraq,"The Anti-Zionist League in Iraq (Arabic: عصبة مكافحة الصهيونية في العراق) was an organization in Iraq, active in 1946. The organization was founded by a group of Jewish members of the Iraqi Communist Party in 1945.


== Foundation ==
The petition to found the Anti-Zionist League was signed by eight individuals from Baghdad on September 12, 1945. The government approved the petition on March 16, 1946. Whilst the Communist Party was illegal at the time and the National Liberation Party (considered a front organization for the Communist Party) had been refused legal registration, the Iraqi government allowed the Anti-Zionist League to operate as a legal organization. The reason is said to have been that the government hoped to use the organization to represent Iraqi Jews towards the Anglo-American Commission of Inquiry on Palestine.


== Political line ==
The Anti-Zionist League sought to propagate amongst the Iraqi population to avoid confounding Jews with Zionism, as a measure to confront ""communal hatred"". Zionism was, according to the organization, a colonialist phenomenon. The Anti-Zionist League called for a fully independent Palestine, an Arab democratic government, end to land transfers to Zionists and prohibition of Zionist migration. According to the Anti-Zionist League British and U.S. imperialism was responsible for the rise in sectarian violence and nationalism.


== Leadership ==
Amongst the founders of the organization were Yahuda Siddiq (Central Committee member of the Communist Party) and Masru Qattan and Yusuf Zalluf. Yusuf Zhilkha headed the organization. Zakki Basim, a non-Jew, acted as the liaison between the organization and the Central Committee of the Communist Party.


== Membership ==
The organization was dominated by young Jewish communists. Jewish members of the Communist Party were required by the party to join the organization (those who did not could be accused of Zionist leanings). The membership of the Anti-Zionist League was, however, not exclusively Jewish and communist. There were also some Christian and Muslim members, and some of its members were Progressive Nationalists.


== Al-'Usbah ==
It published a daily newspaper al-'Usbah (العصبة, 'The League'), which had a circulation of 6,000 copies.


== Activities ==
During its three months of legal existence, the Anti-Zionist League organized twenty-two public meetings. In Baghdad up to 5,000 people could take part some of these meetings. Two public meetings were held in Basra, with thousands of participants.


== Ban ==
Al-'Usbah was banned in June 1946, shortly after its foundation. The organization was declared illegal by the Iraqi government in July 1946. Members of the organization were arrested and charged with the crime of Zionism.

Emerald Tablet,"The Emerald Tablet, also known as the Smaragdine Tablet or the Tabula Smaragdina (Latin, from the Arabic: لَوْح الزُّمُرُّذ, Lawḥ al-zumurrudh), is a compact and cryptic Hermetic text. It was highly regarded by Islamic and European alchemists as the foundation of their art. Though attributed to the legendary Hellenistic figure Hermes Trismegistus, the text of the Emerald Tablet first appears in a number of early medieval Arabic sources, the oldest of which dates to the late eighth or early ninth century. It was translated into Latin several times in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Numerous interpretations and commentaries followed.
Medieval and early modern alchemists associated the Emerald Tablet with the creation of the philosophers' stone and the artificial production of gold.It has also been popular with nineteenth and twentieth century occultists and esotericists, among whom the expression ""as above, so below"" (a modern paraphrase of the second verse of the Tablet) has become an often cited motto.


== History ==
From the 3rd or 2nd century BC, Greek texts attributed to the mythical character Hermes Trismegistus, holder of all knowledge, began to appear in Hellenistic Egypt. These texts, known as the Hermetica, are a heterogeneous collection of works that encompass alchemical, magical, astrological, and medicinal elements. They culminate in the mystical-philosophical treatises of the Corpus Hermeticum from the 2nd or 3rd century. In one of these works, the Koré Kosmou (the ""Pupil of the World""), Hermes engraves and conceals his teachings before ascending to the heavens ""so that every generation born after the world should seek them"".In 640, Egypt, which had become Christian and Byzantine, was conquered by the Arabs, who perpetuated the Hermetic and alchemical tradition in which the Emerald Tablet is situated.
Until the early 20th century, only Latin versions of the Emerald Tablet were known, with the oldest dating back to the 12th century. The first Arabic versions were rediscovered by the English historian of science E.J. Holmyard (1891-1959) and the German orientalist Julius Ruska (1867-1949).


=== Arabic versions ===
The Emerald Tablet has been found in various ancient Arabic works in different versions. The oldest version is found as an appendix in a treatise believed to have been composed in the 9th century, known as the Book of the Secret of Creation, Kitâb sirr al-Halîka in Arabic. This text presents itself as a translation of Apollonius of Tyana, under his Arabic name Balînûs. Although no Greek manuscript has been found, it is plausible that an original Greek text existed. The attribution to Apollonius, though false (pseudonymous), is common in medieval Arabic texts on magic, astrology, and alchemy.
The introduction to the Book of the Secret of Creation is a narrative that explains, among other things, that ""all things are composed of four elemental principles: heat, cold, moisture, and dryness"" (the four qualities of Aristotle), and their combinations account for the ""relations of sympathy and antipathy between beings."" Balînûs, ""master of talismans and wonders,"" enters a crypt beneath the statue of Hermes Trismegistus and finds the emerald tablet in the hands of a seated old man, along with a book. The core of the work is primarily an alchemical treatise that introduces for the first time the idea that all metals are formed from sulfur and mercury, a fundamental theory of alchemy in the Middle Ages. The text of the Emerald Tablet appears last, as an appendix. It has long been debated whether it is an extraneous piece, solely cosmogonic in nature, or if it is an integral part of the rest of the work, in which case it has an alchemical significance from the outset. Recently, it has been suggested that it is actually a text of talismanic magic and that the confusion arises from a mistranslation from Arabic to Latin.Emerald is the stone traditionally associated with Hermes, while mercury is his metal. Mars is associated with red stones and iron, and Saturn is associated with black stones and lead. In antiquity, Greeks and Egyptians referred to various green-colored minerals (green jasper and even green granite) as emerald, and in the Middle Ages, this also applied to objects made of colored glass, such as the ""Emerald Tablet"" of the Visigothic kings  or the Sacro Catino of Genoa (a dish seized by the Crusaders during the sack of Caesarea in 1011, which was believed to have been offered by the Queen of Sheba to Solomon and used during the Last Supper).This version of the Emerald Tablet is also found in the Kitab Ustuqus al-Uss al-Thani (Elementary Book of the Foundation) attributed to the 8th-century alchemist Jâbir ibn Hayyân, known in Europe as Geber.
Another version is found in an eclectic book from the 10th century, the Secretum Secretorum (Secret of Secrets, Sirr al-asrâr), which presents itself as a pseudo-letter from Aristotle to Alexander the Great during the conquest of Persia. It discusses politics, morality, physiognomy, astrology, alchemy, medicine, and more. The text is also attributed to Hermes but lacks the narrative of the tablet's discovery.
The literary theme of the discovery of Hermes' hidden wisdom can be found in other Arabic texts from around the 10th century. For example, in the Book of Crates, while praying in the temple of Serapis, Crates, a Greek philosopher, has a vision of ""an old man, the most beautiful of men, seated in a chair. He was dressed in white garments and held a tablet on the chair, upon which was placed a book [...]. When I asked who this old man was, I was told, 'He is Hermes Trismegistus, and the book before him is one of those that contain the explanation of the secrets he has hidden from men.'"". A similar account can be found in the Latin text known as Tabula Chemica by Senior Zadith, the Arabic alchemist Ibn Umail, in which a stone table rests on the knees of Hermes Trismegistus in the secret chamber of a pyramid. Here, the table is not inscribed with text but with ""hieroglyphic"" symbols.


=== Early Latin versions and medieval commentaries ===


==== Latin versions ====
The Book of the Secret of Creation was translated into Latin (Liber de secretis naturae) in the early 12th century by Hugh of Santalla, but this version of the Emerald Tablet was not widely known.The Secretum Secretorum was translated into Latin in a shortened version by Johannes Hispalensis or Hispaniensis (John of Seville) around 1140, and then in a longer version by Philip of Tripoli around 1220. It became one of the most famous books of the Middle Ages.A third Latin version can be found in an alchemical treatise dating probably from the 12th century (although no manuscripts are known before the 13th or 14th century), the Liber Hermetis de alchimia (Book of Alchemy of Hermes). This version, known as the ""vulgate,"" is the most widespread. The translator of this version did not understand the Arabic word tilasm, which means talisman, and transcribed it into Latin as telesmus or telesmum (which became télesme in French), and it was variously interpreted by commentators, becoming ""one of the most characteristic - and most vague - terms in alchemy"".


==== Latin and French texts ====
Tabula smaragdina Hermetis Trismegisti

""Verum, sine mendacio, certum et verissimum : quod est inferius est sicut quod est superius; et quod est superius est sicut quod est inferius, ad perpetranda miracula rei unius. Et sicut omnes res fuerunt ab uno, mediatione unius, sic omnes res natae fuerunt ab hac una re, adaptatione. Pater ejus est Sol, mater ejus Luna; portavit illud Ventus in ventre suo; nutrix ejus Terra est. Pater omnis telesmi totius mundi est hic. Vis ejus integra est si versa fuerit in terram. Separabis terram ab igne, subtile a spisso, suaviter, cum magno ingenio. Ascendit a terra in caelum, iterumque descendit in terram, et recipit vim superiorum et inferiorum. Sic habebis gloriam totius mundi. Ideo fugiet a te omnis obscuritas. Haec est totius fortitudinis fortitudo fortis; quia vincet omnem rem subtilem, omnemque solidam penetrabit. Sic mundus creatus est. Hinc erunt adaptationes mirabiles, quarum modus est hic. Itaque vocatus sum Hermes Trismegistus, habens tres partes philosophiae totius mundi. Completum est quod dixi de operatione Solis.""
The Emerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistus, Father of Philosophers (translated by L'Hortulain)

""True, without falsehood, certain, and most true: What is below is like what is above, and what is above is like what is below, to accomplish the miracles of one thing. And as all things were derived from one by the meditation of one, so all things are born from this one thing by adaptation. The Sun is its father, the Moon is its mother, the Wind has carried it in its belly, its nurse is the Earth. The father of all telesms of the whole world is here. Its power is whole if it is converted into Earth. You will separate the Earth from the Fire, the subtle from the dense, gently and with great skill. It ascends from Earth to Heaven, and then it descends again to Earth, and receives the power of the superiors and the inferiors. Thus, you will have the glory of the whole world; and all darkness will flee from you. This is the strong force of all forces, overcoming every subtle thing and penetrating every solid thing. Thus, the world was created. From this, marvelous adaptations will arise, of which the manner is here. Therefore, I am called Hermes Trismegistus, having the three parts of the philosophy of the whole world. What I have said about the operation of the Sun is accomplished and ended.""


==== Comments ====
The Table of Emerald and its legendary discovery are mentioned for the first time in De essentiis (1143) by Herman of Carinthia, a friend of Robert of Chester, who translated in 1144 the Liber de compositione alchimiae, considered the first treatise on alchemy in the West.An anonymous commentator from the 12th century explains that ""the father of all telesma"" means ""of all secrets."" Indeed, divination among the Arabs is called ""telesma""; thus, this divination is superior to all others. Later, only the meaning of secret was retained.It is found in Albertus Magnus' De mineralibus around 1256.Around 1275-1280, Roger Bacon translated and commented on the Secret of Secrets, and through a completely alchemical interpretation of the Emerald Tablet, made it an allegorical summary of the Great Work.
The most well-known commentary is that of Hortulanus, an alchemist about whom very little is known, in the first half of the 14th century: I, Hortulanus, that is to say, gardener... I have wanted to write a clear explanation and certain explanation of the words of Hermes, father of philosophers, although they are obscure, and to sincerely explain the entire practice of the true work. And certainly, it is of no use for philosophers to want to hide the science in their writings when the doctrine of the Holy Spirit operates. This text is in line with the symbolic alchemy that developed in the 14th century, particularly with the texts attributed to the Catalan physician Arnau de Vilanova, which establish an allegorical comparison between Christian mysteries and alchemical operations. In Hortulanus' commentary, devoid of practical considerations, the Great Work is an imitation of the divine creation of the world from chaos: ""And as all things have been and arose from one by the mediation of one: so all things have their birth from this one thing by adaptation.""
The sun and the moon represent alchemical gold and silver. Hortulanus interprets ""telesma"" as ""secret"" or ""treasure"": ""It is written afterward: 'The father of all telesma of the world is here,' that is to say: in the work of the stone is found the final path. And note that the philosopher calls the operation 'father of all telesma,' that is to say, of all the secret or all the treasure of the entire world, that is to say, of every stone discovered in this world."".The Tabula Chemica by Ibn Umail, in which the table is engraved with symbols, is translated as early as the 12th or 13th century. Starting from 1420, extensive excerpts are included in an illuminated text, the Aurora consurgens, which is one of the earliest cycles of alchemical symbols. One of the illustrations shows the discovery of Hermes' table in a temple surmounted by Sagittarius eagles (representing the volatile elements). This motif is frequently used in Renaissance prints and is the visual expression of the myth of the rediscovery of ancient knowledge—the transmission of this knowledge, in the form of hieroglyphic pictograms, allows it to escape the distortions of human and verbal interpretation.


=== From the Renaissance to the Enlightenment ===
During the Renaissance, the idea that Hermes Trismegistus was the founder of alchemy gained prominence, and at the same time, the legend of the discovery evolved and intertwined with biblical accounts. This is particularly the case in the late 15th century in the Livre de la philosophie naturelle des métaux by the pseudo-Bernard of Treviso: ""The first inventor of this Art was Hermes Trismegistus, for he knew all three natural philosophies, namely Mineral, Vegetable, and Animal."" After the flood, he found in the valley of Hebron, where Adam lived after being expelled from the earthly paradise, seven marble tablets on which the principles of the seven liberal arts are engraved. He wrote a brief work (which reproduces the beginning of the Emerald Tablet), which passed to his disciple Pythagoras, then to Plato, Aristotle, and finally to Alexander the Great. Thus, the ante-diluvian wisdom was transmitted, independently of the revelation made to Moses at Sinai.It further evolves with Jérôme Torella in his book on astrology, Opus Praeclarum de imaginibus astrologicis (Valence, 1496), in which it is Alexander the Great who discovers a Tabula Zaradi in Hermes' tomb while traveling to the Oracle of Amun in Egypt. This story is repeated by Michael Maier, physician and counselor to the ""alchemical emperor"" Rudolf II, in his symbola aureae mensae (Frankfurt, 1617), referring to a Liber de Secretis chymicis attributed to Albertus Magnus. In the same year, he publishes the famous Atalanta Fugiens (Fleeing Atalanta), illustrated by Theodor de Bry with fifty alchemical emblems, each accompanied by a poem, a musical fugue, and alchemical and mythological explanations. The first two emblems depict a passage from the Emerald Tablet: ""the wind has carried it in its belly; the earth is its nurse,"" and the explanatory text begins with ""Hermes, the most diligent explorer of all natural secrets, describes in his Emerald Tablet the work of nature, albeit briefly and accurately.""
The first printed edition appears in 1541 in the De alchemia published by Johann Petreius and edited by a certain Chrysogonus Polydorus, who is likely a pseudonym for the Lutheran theologian Andreas Osiander (Osiander also edited Copernicus' On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres in 1543, published by the same printer). This version is known as the ""vulgate"" version and includes the commentary by Hortulanus.
In 1583, a commentary by Gerard Dorn is published in Frankfurt by Christoph Corvinus. In De Luce naturae physica, this disciple of Paracelsus makes a detailed parallel between the Table and the first chapter of the Genesis attributed to Moses.
In the 15th and 16th centuries, verse versions appear, including an anonymous sonnet revised by the alchemical poet Clovis Hesteau de Nuysement in his work Traittez de l'harmonie, et constitution generalle du vray sel, secret des Philosophes, & de l'esprit universel du monde (1621):

However, from the beginning of the 17th century onward, a number of authors challenge the attribution of the Emerald Tablet to Hermes Trismegistus and, through it, attack antiquity and the validity of alchemy. First among them is a ""repentant"" alchemist, the Lorraine physician Nicolas Guibert, in 1603. But it is the Jesuit scholar and linguist Athanasius Kircher who launches the strongest attack in his monumental work Oedipus Aegyptiacus (Rome, 1652-1653). He notes that no texts speak of the Emerald Tablet before the Middle Ages and that its discovery by Alexander the Great is not mentioned in any ancient testimonies. By comparing the vocabulary used with that of the Corpus Hermeticum (which had been proven by Isaac Casaubon in 1614 to date only from the 2nd or 3rd century AD), he affirms that the Emerald Tablet is a forgery by a medieval alchemist. As for the alchemical teaching of the Emerald Tablet, it is not limited to the philosopher's stone and the transmutation of metals but concerns ""the deepest substance of each thing,"" the alchemists' quintessence. From another perspective, Wilhelm Christoph Kriegsmann publishes in 1657 a commentary in which he tries to demonstrate, using the linguistic methods of the time, that the Emerald Tablet was not originally written in Egyptian but in Phoenician.
He continues his studies of ancient texts and in 1684 argues that Hermes Trismegistus is not the Egyptian Thoth but the Taaut of the Phoenicians, who is also the founder of the Germanic people under the name of the god Tuisto, mentioned by Tacitus.In the meantime, Kircher's conclusions are debated by the Danish alchemist Ole Borch in his De ortu et progressu Chemiae (1668), in which he attempts to separate the hermetic texts between the late writings and those truly attributable to the ancient Egyptian Hermes, among which he inclines to classify the Emerald Tablet. The discussions continue, and the treatises of Ole Borch and Kriegsmann are reprinted in the compilation Bibliotheca Chemica Curiosa (1702) by the Swiss physician Jean-Jacques Manget. Although the Emerald Tablet is still translated and commented upon by Isaac Newton, alchemy gradually loses all scientific credibility during the 18th century with the advent of modern chemistry and the work of Lavoisier.


==== The Hermetic Emblem of the Tabula Smaragdina Hermetis ====
From the late 16th century onwards, the Emerald Tablet is often accompanied by a symbolic figure called the Tabula Smaragdina Hermetis.
This figure is surrounded by an acrostic in Latin ""Visita Interiora Terrae Rectificando Invenies Occultum Lapidem"" (“visit the interior of the earth and by rectifying you will find the hidden stone”), whose seven initials form the word VITRIOL (the ancient name for sulfuric acid). At the top, the sun and moon pour into a cup above the symbol of mercury. Around the mercurial cup are the four other planets, representing the classic association between the seven planets and the seven metals: Sun/Gold, Moon/Silver, Mercury/Mercury, Jupiter/Tin, Mars/Iron, Venus/Copper, Saturn/Lead, which were also connected by traditional colors (gold, silver, gray, blue, red, green, black) to the seven words of the acrostic in the early versions of the symbol. In the center, there are a ring and an imperial globe, and at the bottom, there are the spheres of the sky and the earth (alluding to the macrocosm and microcosm). Three escutcheons represent, according to the poem, the three principles (tria prima) of the alchemical theory of Paracelsus: Eagle/Mercury/Spirit, Lion/Sulfur/Soul, and Star/Salt/Body. Finally, two prophetic hands frame the image and ""swear to the true foundation and true doctrine.""

The oldest known reproduction is a copy dated 1588-89 of a manuscript that was circulating anonymously at the time and was likely written in the second half of the 16th century by a German Paracelsian. The image was accompanied by a didactic alchemical poem in German titled Du secret des sages, probably by the same author. The poem explains the symbolism in relation to the Great Work and the classical goals of alchemy: wealth, health, and long life. Initially, it was only accompanied by the text of the Emerald Tablet as a secondary element. However, in printed reproductions during the 17th century, the accompanying poem disappeared, and the emblem became known as the Tabula Smaragdina Hermetis, the symbol or graphical representation of the Emerald Tablet, as ancient as the tablet itself.
For example, in 1733, according to the alchemist Ehrd de Naxagoras (Supplementum Aurei Velleris), a ""precious emerald plate"" engraved with inscriptions and the symbol was made upon Hermes' death and found in the valley of Ebron by a woman named Zora. This emblem is placed within the mysterious tradition of Egyptian hieroglyphs and the idea of Platonists and alchemists during the Renaissance that the ""deepest secrets of nature could only be expressed appropriately through an obscure and veiled mode of representation"".


=== 19th-20th Century: From Occultism to Esotericism and Surrealism ===
Alchemy and its alleged ""foundational text"" continue to interest occultists. This is the case with the mage Éliphas Lévi: ""Nothing surpasses and nothing equals as a summary of all the doctrines of the old world the few sentences engraved on a precious stone by Hermes and known as the 'emerald tablet'... it is all of magic on a single page."". It also applies to the ""curious figure"" of the German Gottlieb Latz, who self-published a monumental work Die Alchemie in 1869, as well as the theosophist Helena Blavatsky and the perennialist Titus Burckhardt.At the beginning of the 20th century, alchemical thought resonated with the surrealists, and André Breton incorporated the main axiom of the Emerald Tablet into the Second Manifesto of Surrealism (1930): ""Everything leads us to believe that there exists a certain point of the spirit from which life and death, the real and the imaginary, the past and the future, the communicable and the incommunicable, the high and the low, cease to be perceived as contradictory. However, in vain would one seek any motive other than the hope for the determination of this point in surrealist activity."". Although some commentators mainly see the influence of the philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel in this statement, Hegel's philosophy itself was influenced by Jakob Böhme.


== Textual history ==
The tablet states its author as Hermes Trismegistus (""Hermes the Thrice-Greatest""), a legendary Hellenistic combination of the Greek god Hermes and the ancient Egyptian god Thoth. Like most other works attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, the Emerald Tablet is very hard to date with any precision, but generally belongs to the late antique period (between c. 200 and c. 800). The oldest known source of the text is the Sirr al-khalīqa wa-ṣanʿat al-ṭabīʿa (The Secret of Creation and the Art of Nature, also known as the Kitāb al-ʿilal or The Book of Causes), an encyclopedic work on natural philosophy falsely attributed to Apollonius of Tyana (c. 15–100, Arabic: Balīnūs or Balīnās). This book was compiled in Arabic in the late eighth or early ninth century, but it was most likely based on (much) older Greek and/or Syriac sources. In the frame story of the Sirr al-khalīqa, Balīnūs tells his readers that he discovered the text in a vault below a statue of Hermes in Tyana, and that, inside the vault, an old corpse on a golden throne held the emerald tablet.Slightly different versions of the Emerald Tablet also appear in the Kitāb Usṭuqus al-uss al-thānī (The Second Book of the Element of the Foundation, c. 850–950) attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan, in the longer version of the Sirr al-asrār (The Secret of Secrets, a tenth century compilation of earlier works that was falsely attributed to Aristotle), and in the Egyptian alchemist Muhammed ibn Umail al-Tamimi's (ca. 900 – 960) Kitāb al-māʾ al-waraqī wa-l-arḍ al-najmiyya (Book of the Silvery Water and the Starry Earth).The Emerald Tablet was translated into Latin in the twelfth century by Hugo of Santalla as part of his translation of the Sirr al-khalīqa. It was again translated into Latin along with the thirteenth century translation of the longer version of the pseudo-Aristotelian Sirr al-asrār (Latin: Secretum secretorum). However, the Latin translation which formed the basis for all later versions (the so-called 'Vulgate') was originally part of an anonymous compilation of alchemical commentaries on the Emerald Tablet variously called Liber Hermetis de alchimia, Liber dabessi, or Liber rebis (first half of the twelfth century).


=== Arabic versions of the tablet text ===


==== From pseudo-Apollonius of Tyana's Sirr al-khalīqa (c. 750–850) ====
The earliest known version of the Emerald Tablet on which all later versions were based is found in pseudo-Apollonius of Tyana's Sirr al-khalīqa wa-ṣanʿat al-ṭabīʿa (The Secret of Creation and the Art of Nature).


==== From the Kitāb Usṭuqus al-uss al-thānī (ca. 850–950) attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan ====
A somewhat shorter version is quoted in the Kitāb Usṭuqus al-uss al-thānī (The Second Book of the Element of the Foundation) attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan. Lines 6, 8, and 11–15 from the version in the Sirr al-khalīqa are missing, while other parts seem to be corrupt. Jabir's version was translated by Eric J. Holmyard:


==== From the pseudo-Aristotelian Sirr al-asrār (tenth century) ====
A still later version is found in the pseudo-Aristotelian Sirr al-asrār (Secret of Secrets, tenth century).


=== Medieval Latin versions of the tablet text ===


==== From the Latin translation of pseudo-Apollonius of Tyana's Sirr al-khalīqa (De secretis nature) ====
The tablet was translated into Latin in c. 1145–1151 by Hugo of Santalla as part of his translation of the Sirr al-khalīqa (The Secret of Creation, original Arabic above).


==== From the Latin translation of the pseudo-Aristotelian Sirr al-asrār (Secretum secretorum) ====
The tablet was also translated into Latin as part of the longer version of the pseudo-Aristotelian Sirr al-asrār (Latin: Secretum Secretorum, original Arabic above). It differs significantly both from the translation by Hugo of Santalla (see above) and the Vulgate translation (see below).


==== Vulgate (from the Liber Hermetis de alchimia or Liber dabessi) ====
The most widely distributed Latin translation (the so-called 'Vulgate') is found in an anonymous compilation of commentaries on the Emerald Tablet that was translated from a lost Arabic original. This alchemical compilation was variously called Liber Hermetis de alchimia, Liber dabessi, or Liber rebis. Its translator has been tentatively identified as Plato of Tivoli, who was active in c. 1134–1145. However, this is merely a conjecture, and although it can be deduced from other indices that the text dates to the first half of the twelfth century, its translator remains unknown.The Vulgate version also differs significantly from the other two early Latin versions. A critical edition based on eight manuscripts was prepared by Robert Steele and Dorothea W. Singer in 1928:


=== Early modern versions of the tablet text ===


==== Latin (Nuremberg, 1541) ====
Despite some small differences, the 16th-century Nuremberg edition of the Latin text remains largely similar to the vulgate (see above). A translation by Isaac Newton is found among his alchemical papers that are currently housed in King's College Library, Cambridge University:


== Influence ==
In its several Western recensions, the Tablet became a mainstay of medieval and Renaissance alchemy. Commentaries and/or translations were published by, among others, Trithemius, Roger Bacon, Michael Maier, Albertus Magnus, and Isaac Newton. The concise text was a popular summary of alchemical principles, wherein the secrets of the philosophers' stone were thought to have been described.The fourteenth century alchemist Ortolanus (or Hortulanus) wrote a substantial exegesis on The Secret of Hermes, which was influential on the subsequent development of alchemy. Many manuscripts of this copy of the Emerald Tablet and the commentary of Ortolanus survive, dating at least as far back as the fifteenth century. Ortolanus, like Albertus Magnus before him saw the tablet as a cryptic recipe that described laboratory processes using deck names (or code words). This was the dominant view held by Europeans until the fifteenth century.By the early sixteenth century, the writings of Johannes Trithemius (1462–1516) marked a shift away from a laboratory interpretation of the Emerald Tablet, to a metaphysical approach.  Trithemius equated Hermes' one thing with the monad of pythagorean philosophy and the anima mundi. This interpretation of the Hermetic text was adopted by alchemists such as John Dee, Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, and Gerhard Dorn.


== In popular culture ==
In the time travel television series Dark, the mysterious priest Noah has a large image of the Emerald Tablet tattooed on his back. The image, which is from Heinrich Khunrath’s Amphitheatre of Eternal Wisdom (1609), also appears on a metal door in the caves that are central to the plot. Several characters are shown looking at copies of the text. A line from the Latin version, ""Sic mundus creatus est"" (So was the world created), plays a prominent thematic role in the series and is the title of the sixth episode of the first season.In 1974, Brazilian singer Jorge Ben Jor recorded a studio album under the name A Tábua de Esmeralda (""The Emerald Tablet""), quoting from the Tablet's text and from alchemy in general in several songs. The album has been defined as an exercise in ""musical alchemy"" and celebrated as Ben Jor's greatest musical achievement, blending together samba, jazz, and rock rhythms.

Various Translations of the Tablet
Various Pieces on the Emerald Tablet","The Emerald Tablet, also known as the Smaragdine Tablet or the Tabula Smaragdina (Latin, from the Arabic: لَوْح الزُّمُرُّذ, Lawḥ al-zumurrudh), is a compact and cryptic Hermetic text. It was highly regarded by Islamic and European alchemists as the foundation of their art.",The Emerald Tablet is a lengthy and clear Buddhist text.,0
David McGhee,"David Christopher McGhee (born 19 June 1976) is an English retired professional footballer, who made over 230 appearances as a utility player in the Football League for Brentford and Leyton Orient.


== Playing career ==


=== Early years ===
McGhee was born in Worthing. Starting out as a defender, he began his career in the youth system at Plymouth Argyle. He was not taken on as a scholar by first team manager Peter Shilton and dropped into non-League football to sign for local South Western League club St Austell.


=== Brentford ===
McGhee joined Second Division club Brentford on trial in 1993, after the club responded to a contact request from his father. He signed a professional contract with the Bees in April 1994 and received his maiden call into the first team squad for a Football League Trophy first round match versus Brighton & Hove Albion on 19 October that year. He remained on the bench for the 1–0 victory. McGhee's professional debut came on 21 January 1995, when he replaced Darren Annon during a 2–1 league win over Hull City. He was largely an unused substitute during the rest of the 1994–95 season, finishing with seven appearances and scored one goal.McGhee established himself in the first team during the 1995–96 season, wearing five different shirt numbers and proving to be an able utility player. He made 45 appearances and scored six goals.McGhee's best season for Brentford came in 1996–97, when he made a season-high 53 appearances and scored two goals. The Bees led the Second Division for much of the first two-thirds of the season, before dropping to fourth position and qualifying for the playoffs. After beating Bristol City 4–2 on aggregate in the semi-finals, the Bees lost 1–0 to Crewe Alexandra at Wembley Stadium in the final.McGhee was again a regular pick during the 1997–98 season, making 33 appearances and scoring one goal in which Brentford's playoff hangover consigned them to relegation to the Third Division after a final-day defeat to Bristol Rovers. A succession of injuries saw McGhee miss the entire 1998–99 season, and he retired in January 1999. He made 138 appearances and scored 10 goals during his time at Griffin Park.


=== Stevenage Borough ===
McGhee came out of retirement to sign for Conference club Stevenage Borough in August 1999. He made two appearances before departing Broadhall Way before the end of the first month of the season.


=== Leyton Orient ===
McGhee returned to the Football League to sign for struggling Third Division club Leyton Orient in November 1999. He quickly established himself in the side, making 23 appearances and scoring one goal during the remainder of the 1999–00 season to help the Os retain their league status. McGhee had an excellent 2000–01 season, making 51 appearances and scoring three goals as the Os finished in the playoff positions. As with Brentford in 1997, McGhee suffered heartbreak in his second appearance at Wembley Stadium, with Orient crashing to a 4–2 defeat to Blackpool in the final, after having twice taken the lead.Orient suffered a hangover in the 2001–02 season, though McGhee again featured in almost all the club's matches, making 45 appearances and scoring two goals. McGhee's run as a mainstay of the team came to an end on 10 September 2002, when he suffered a ruptured achilles tendon after 11 minutes of a 3–2 League Cup first round victory over Queens Park Rangers. He returned to match play just over a year later and was named captain, but managed just 12 appearances and one goal during the 2003–04 season, before leaving the club on 25 March 2004. McGhee made 135 appearances and scored seven goals during five years at Brisbane Road. His performances earned him the nickname ""Mad Dog"".


=== Return to non-League football ===
On 25 March 2004, McGhee dropped into non-League football to join high-flying Isthmian League Premier Division club Canvey Island on a contract running until the end of the 2005–06 season. Following the club's promotion to the Conference Premier at the end of the 2003–04 season, McGhee failed to hold down a regular place in the team and made 47 appearances and scored one goal before departing at the end of the 2005–06 season.McGhee continued his descent down the pyramid with short spells at Isthmian League clubs Chelmsford City and Wivenhoe Town respectively during the first half of the 2006–07 season. McGhee returned to Cornwall in late 2006 to sign for South Western League club Falmouth Town. He signed for East Cornwall League Premier Division club Lanreath in 2007 and played for the team until 2015. He re-emerged with the club's veterans' team 2017, playing as a goalkeeper.


== Managerial career ==
McGhee has held coaching and assistant manager positions in the youth setup at local Cornish club Looe Town. He served as joint-player-manager of East Cornwall League First Division club Lanreath during the 2014–15 season.


== Personal life ==
McGhee's son Callum played under his management at Lanreath. In March 2015, McGhee was diagnosed with a brain tumour.

"First National Bank and Trust Building (Lima, Ohio)","The First National Bank and Trust Building is a historic building on Public Square in downtown Lima, Ohio, United States. The rectangular building, completed in 1926, was designed by Weary & Alford Company, an architectural firm from Chicago.  It was the location of the offices of the First National Bank and Trust Company from 1926 until 1974, when the company became a part of Huntington Bank.  The structure's twelve stories are faced with Indiana Limestone.  Each column of windows is topped with an arch window on the highest floor, and the spandrels between the arch windows are connected to each other.Founded as the ""Lima Trust Company"" in 1903, the First National Bank and Trust used a Masonic building in its earliest years.  Starting in 1906, it operated in a smaller building (now destroyed), which served as its offices until it moved into its newly erected structure in 1926.  During the early twentieth century, the influence of railroads and the oil industry caused Lima to be a very prosperous city.  Many large buildings, including two skyscrapers, were built in the city's downtown; the majority of these new structures employed the Chicago Style of architecture.  With the decline of the city's economy later in the century, the construction of large buildings in central Lima ceased — virtually all new construction took place in the city's outskirts or suburbs — thus making the First National Bank and Trust one of the newest major buildings in downtown Lima.: 2   In recognition of its historic significance, the First National Bank and Trust was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.  It was one of seventeen Lima buildings that was added to the National Register as part of the ""Lima Multiple Resource Area,"" a Multiple Property Submission that concentrated on architecturally significant buildings in or near downtown Lima.: 3 Aside from its importance as a historic site, the First National Bank and Trust Building plays a leading part in local ornithology: the building is a nesting site for peregrine falcons and is part of the Midwest Peregrine Falcon Restoration Project.

Thorngumbald,"Thorngumbald is a village and civil parish in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England, in an area known as Holderness, 8 miles (13 km) east of Hull on the A1033. The civil parish is formed by the village and the hamlets of Camerton and Ryehill. At the 2011 census, it had a population of 3,392, an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 3,106.


== History ==
Thorngumbald was once a Viking settlement – the official emblem of Thorngumbald is a Viking helmet with wings. The name was first recorded in the Domesday Book as ""Torn"", an Old English word meaning 'thorn bush'. The name was still in use in 1228, but by 1260 it had become ""Thorne"". In the lay subsidy rolls of Edward 1, 1297, it is given as Thorengumbald. A Baron Gumbaud had settled in the area, adding his name to the original and giving the village its present name. The Gumbaud name was associated with the local Lord of the manor in the 13th century. By the 17th century the village had had different spellings, including Thorgumbaud, Thorngumbold, Thorneygumbald and Gumberthorn. The current name has been in use since then. The Gumbaud family still live in the village.


== Community ==
The parish church of St Mary is a Grade II listed building. The village also had a Methodist church, built 1904. However the stones of the church were relaid in 1984.The village shopping centre has five shops: a small Boots chemist, a newsagents, a deli / sandwich shop, and a fish and chip shop. A newly refurbished mini supermarket was opened in 2021. Elsewhere in the village there are three hairdressing salons, a Chinese takeaway, the Royal Mail public house (demolished early 2017), The New Royal Mail Public house, a restaurant, a Royal Mail post office.
Thorngumbald Primary School hosts meetings for local organisations, such as the Brownies and St John Ambulance which provide weekly activities for children and teenagers.
The local parish offers courses, such as ICT, for people within the village at the local Village Hall on the main road (A1033).
Bowls is also played at the Village Hall along with table tennis. There are also line dancing classes at the Village Institute.  The Village Hall and the Parish Councillors organise an annual Scarecrow Trail that takes place throughout the village every summer. People of all ages are involved, with the prize usually a trophy.The village is home to England rugby league international Jon Wilkin and former Hull City player Chris Chilton.


== Education ==
Thorngumbald Primary School is a local Primary School catering for children aged between 4 and 11. The school is a September 2007 amalgamation of Thorngumbald Infant and Junior Schools, now on a newly built site on Plumtree Road, originally the site used by Thorngumbald Infant School.South Holderness Technology College in the village of Preston is the nearest secondary school. It caters for students from ages 11 to 16, with a Sixth Form College for those from 16 to 18. Thorngumbald is within the school's catchment area and buses provided by the school transport students of all age groups to and from the village in the morning and afternoon.In September 2013, the village briefly gained local attention due to bus pass prices to and from South Holderness School. BBC Look North (East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire) were present throughout the village interviewing students and their parents. The prices currently stand at £540 per bus pass for one academic year to travel to and from the school, provided you live three miles or less away from the school. Since this event, there have been a few minor protests including petitions and some of the students who have to pay for the school bus pass, getting on the public bus service as it is much cheaper.
There is a nursery on Grange Road.


== Transport ==
The village was once served by a railway linking Withernsea and Hull at Ryehill and Burstwick station. It closed in 1964 following the Beeching cuts. Thorngumbald is now served by EYMS daily bus routes linking the village to Withernsea and Hull.


== Sport ==
The village has its own football club which competes in the Hull & District Youth Football League And Cup, Thorngumbald Barrons who play their home matches on the playing fields on Plumtree Road.

Fortified Sector of Thionville,"The Fortified Sector of Thionville (Secteur fortifié de Thionville) was the French military organisation that in 1940 controlled the section of the Maginot Line immediately to the north of Thionville.  The sector describes an arc of about 25 kilometres (16 mi), about halfway between the French border with Luxembourg and Thionville. The Thionville sector was the strongest of the Maginot Line sectors. It was surrounded but not seriously attacked in 1940 by German forces in the Battle of France, whose main objective was the city of Metz.  Despite the withdrawal of the mobile forces that supported the fixed fortifications, the sector successfully fended off German assaults before the  Second Armistice at Compiègne. The majority of the positions and their garrisons finally surrendered on 27 June 1940, the remainder on 2 July.  Following the war, many positions were reactivated for use during the Cold War.  Four locations are now preserved and open to the public.
The Thionville sector was part of the larger Fortified Region of Metz, a strongly defended area between the Ardennes to the west and the Sarre Valley to the east. The Metz region was more important during the planning and construction phase of the Maginot Line than it was in the operational phase of the Line, when the sectors assumed prominence. The Fortified Region of Metz was dissolved as a military organisation on 18 March 1940.


== Concept and Organisation ==
The sector was planned to protect Thionville, an important industrial city, and by extension, Metz, just to the south. Construction began in most places in 1930, and was largely complete by 1935. A reinforcing line was planned to back up the Cattenom salient, which protruded to the north between Bois-Karre and Galgenberg, with Kobenbusch forming the point of the northward projection. Two casemate groups and the petit ouvrage du Beysel were proposed but were never built. The reinforcing role was partially assumed by three ex-German fortifications, the Forts de Guentrange, Illange and Koenigsmacker, which encircled Thionville and possessed long-range artillery.

			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


== Command ==
The Thionville sector was under the overall command of the French 3rd Army, headquartered at Fort Jeanne d'Arc at Metz, under the command of General Charles Condé, which was in turn part of Army Group 2 under General André-Gaston Prételat. The SF (secteur fortifiée) Thionville was commanded by General Cousse, then General Poisot from 1 January 1940. The command post was in the Fort d'Illange, south of Thionville. The interval troops, the army formations that were to provide the mobile defence for the sector, to support and be supported by the fixed defences, were under the command of the Colonial Corps (Corps d'Armee Colonial (CAC)), General Fredenberg, commanding from the Château de Bétange. The Colonial Corps was in turn made up of the 2nd and 56th Infantry Divisions. Artillery support for the sector was provided by the 151st Position Artillery Regiment (Régiment d'Artillerie de Position (RAP)), which controlled both fixed and mobile artillery, commanded by Lt Colonel Martin. The 2nd ID was made up of Class A reservists, while the 56th ID was a Class B reserve formation, not considered suitable for significant combat.

== History ==


=== Battle of France ===
During the early part of the Battle of France, the SF Thionville was relatively quiet. Both sides kept up shelling and harassing attacks, but there were no major engagements in the sector in May and early June 1940. Elsewhere, the situation was deteriorating fast. To the west, the German 16th Army was advancing up the valley of the Meuse to Verdun, aiming for Metz and Nancy. In the centre, the German 1st Army had broken through at the Sarre on 15 June. To the east, the Rhine was crossed on the same day. German armies were moving freely behind French lines with the goal of encircling France's field armies, capturing the cities of Alsace and Lorraine, and cutting off the fixed fortifications.By mid-June, faced with the progressive collapse of the French First Army to the west, the interval troops began to pull back to avoid being encircled behind the Maginot Line. Measure A, issued by 3rd Army headquarters, called for the withdrawal of the interval troops on 15 June, protected by the casemates and ouvrages. Measure B was the withdrawal of artillery forces from the intervals late that day and into the 16th, protected by the ouvrages. Measure C was the withdrawal of all but skeleton forces from the fortifications. The forces left behind were to withdraw themselves by the 18th after sabotaging all equipment and weapons. Although the interval troops were able to temporarily escape, by the 17th the Thionville sector had been enveloped by the Germans from the east and west. Retreat was impossible for the fortress troops.On 21 June General Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb ordered all attacks against Maginot fortifications to stop, as a waste of resources. Action between the 21st and the date of the June 25 armistice was limited to sporadic shelling and, on the French side, to firing off ammunition at the Germans before it could be captured. Apart from determined German shelling of Block 5 at Rochonvillers, there were no significant attacks on Thionville sector ouvrages.Following the armistice, brief negotiations undertaken by the commandant of Kobenbusch settled on a formal surrender for the garrisons west of the Moselle on 30 June. No such negotiations took place to the east until French officers received confirmation  directly from General Huntziger that they were to surrender their fortifications. The eastern positions of the SF Thionville were surrendered on 2 July 1940


=== Lorraine Campaign ===
While the main Maginot fortifications played no significant role in the Lorraine Campaign of 1944, the pre-Maginot fortifications of Thionville posed a significant obstacle to the advance of American forces, most notably the Fort de Koenigsmacker. The U.S. 90th Infantry Division captured Koenigsmacker after three days of hard fighting on 12 November 1944.


=== Môle de Rochonvillers ===
Following World War II, the French military reclaimed the Maginot Line with the aim of renovating and improving it against a possible attack by Warsaw Pact forces. The strongest positions, Rochonvillers, Molvange and Bréhain of the neighbouring former SF Crusnes were designated the môle de Rochonvillers (""breakwater"") in 1951 and were placed back into service after a period of rehabilitation. Petit ouvrage Immerhof was included in this assemblage Lesser positions, such as Soetrich, Bois-Karre and Sentzich, were repaired and kept as government property, as were the remaining gros ouvrages in the sector, but were not formally designated as places of defence.  After the establishment of the French nuclear strike force, the importance of the Line declined, and maintenance ceased in the 1970s, with most of the casemates and petit ouvrages sold to the public.


=== Command centres ===
In the early 1960s, three ouvrages were renovated as military command centres. Rochonvillers was converted for use as a wartime command centre for the Central Army Group (CENTAG) of NATO and was used for this purpose from 1961 to 1967, when France withdrew from the NATO integrated command structure.  In a similar manner, Molvange became the wartime command centre for the 4th Allied Tactical Air Forces, again from 1961 to 1967. The French military continued to make use of Molvange until 1999. Soetrich saw a similar role in the 1960s. Rochonvillers was reactivated in 1980 as the wartime command centre for the French First Army, operating in that role until 1998. In each of the comparatively spacious underground barracks, magazine space and utility areas were used and expanded. The combat blocks were not used and were sealed from the occupied areas.


== Present status ==
Immerhof, Bois-Karre and Galgenberg are operated as museums and are open to the public.  The surface of Kobenbusch is a nature preserve with trails and interpretive signs.  The lower levels of Kobenbusch have been flooded by the cooling water lake of the Cattenom Nuclear Power Plant, which was built on the site of the Camp de Cattenom. The Casemate du Grand Lot near Rochonvillers is occasionally open for tours. The Abri du Zeiterholz has been restored and is open for tours in the summer months. The Abri du Bois de Cattenom is occasionally open to visits. The remainder are either privately owned or are military property, abandoned and sealed.
The pre-Maginot Fort de Guentrange is operated as a museum.  The surface installations of the Fort d'Illange are accessible to the public, and a similar public use is proposed for the Fort de Koenigsmacker.

Peter Grimwade,"Peter Grimwade (8 June 1942 – 15 May 1990) was a British television director and screenwriter, known for his work as a director and writer of the BBC science fiction television series Doctor Who in the 1980s.


== Career ==
After joining the BBC in the late 1960s, Grimwade first worked on Doctor Who as a production assistant on Jon Pertwee's first serial, Spearhead from Space (1970). He occupied this position on a further five serials. He got his first chance to direct when he was asked to film some model shots for the serial The Robots of Death (1977) while the serial's actual director, Michael E. Briant, directed the rest of it in the studio. Tom Baker, meanwhile, used Grimwade's name to replace the scripted ""Grimwold's Syndrome"" illness mentioned in the script.George Gallaccio, producer of The Omega Factor (1979), gave Grimwade his full directorial debut on the episode ""Out of Body, Out of Mind"" in the series. Grimwade was also around this time a production assistant on the BBC's All Creatures Great and Small (1978) and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (1979). After directing the Doctor Who serial Full Circle (1980) from John Nathan-Turner's first season as producer, Grimwade was given the task of directing Tom Baker's final serial, Logopolis (1981). When Peter Davison became the Doctor, Grimwade first directed him in the serial Kinda (1982) and then directed Earthshock, featuring the return of the Cybermen after seven years and the death of the Doctor's companion Adric.
Earthshock was the last time he was a director on the series. A year later, Grimwade was scheduled to direct the serial The Return (which ultimately became Resurrection of the Daleks (1984)). Industrial action initially prevented the serial from being filmed. When the story was postponed, Grimwade took the cast and crew out to dinner, but did not invite Nathan-Turner, because he had intended to take him out separately. However, Nathan-Turner felt slighted by the omission and refused to allow Grimwade to direct the story when it was rescheduled for season 21. The story was assigned to Matthew Robinson instead. Prior to this, Grimwade had written two serials, Time-Flight (1982) and Mawdryn Undead (1983), and had been asked to write Davison's penultimate story, which became Planet of Fire (1984). Because the story's requirements were in constant flux, mainly due to uncertainty over the filming location and cast changes, he eventually became frustrated and allowed script editor Eric Saward to finish the serial.
Although Planet of Fire transpired to be Grimwade's final work for Doctor Who, on 13 August 1984 he was commissioned by Saward to write a four-part story entitled The League of the Tancreds. The story was to be set in 1890s New York City, where the Sixth Doctor and Peri Brown would encounter an insectoid race called the 'Tancreds'. The story was abandoned on 18 November 1984 due to budget concerns. It was eventually adapted into a novel, Birthright, by Nigel Robinson, published in August 1993.
A short documentary about Grimwade's contribution to Doctor Who is included on the DVD for Kinda, which includes interview footage of the director from the 1980s. The feature would subsequently appear on the Blu-ray set Doctor Who, The Collection, season 19.


=== Later work ===
After leaving Doctor Who, Grimwade wrote and directed The Come-Uppance of Captain Katt (1986) for the ITV children's drama series Dramarama. The play was about events behind-the-scenes on a low-budget science fiction television series, which Grimwade openly acknowledged was inspired by his experience working on Doctor Who.
When the BBC gave the publisher W. H. Allen the rights to use Vislor Turlough in the novel Turlough and the Earthlink Dilemma, W. H. Allen offered Grimwade a chance to publish an original novel. The result was Robot (ISBN 0-352-32036-2), a book filled with Doctor Who references.
After leaving the BBC, Grimwade mainly worked in producing industrial videos. He died in 1990 of leukaemia.

Israel Putnam School,"The Israel Putnam School is a historic school in Putnam, Connecticut.  The school, named in honor of Israel Putnam, is a two-story Classical Revival brick building with limestone trim built in 1902.  It was the town's first modern school building, and the first to include an auditorium.  The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.  It has been converted to residences.


== Description and history ==
The former Israel Putnam School is located east of the city's central business district, at the southwest corner of School and Oak Streets.  It has a large central block with smaller flanking wings, and a matching two-story addition extending to the rear, built in 1922.  Windows are set in rectangular openings, with limestone keystones and sills.  The main entrance is at the center, recessed in an arcade of five arched openings, which extends into the nearly fully exposed basement level.Prior to the construction of this building, the students of Putnam's urban core were educated in a two-story wood frame building that had classes divided by grade.  The city experienced a surge in growth around 1900, and that school as judged inadequate.  This building was designed by John Chandler Fowler and Edward I. Wilson, both of Boston, Massachusetts but not apparently in formal partnership, and was completed in 1902.  It was the city's first school building to include an auditorium, and was specifically designed with an imposing architectural facade to convey seriousness of purpose.

866th Bombardment Squadron,"The 866th Bombardment Squadron is an inactive United States Air Force unit. Its last assignment was as the 866th Technical Training Squadron with the 1st Missile Division at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, where it trained for overseas deployment the SM-78 Jupiter. It was inactivated on 25 May 1962.
The squadron was first activated in late 1943 for service during World War II.  After training in the United States, it deployed to the Pacific, where it participated in the strategic bombing campaign against Japan.  It returned to the United States and was inactivated in 1946.  In 1958, it was redesignated the 866th Strategic Missile Squadron and conducted intermediate range ballistic missile training until again inactivating.


== History ==


=== World War II ===


==== Organization and training in the United States ====
The squadron was first activated as the 866th Bombardment Squadron at Wendover Field, Utah on 1 December 1943 as one of the original squadrons of the 494th Bombardment Group, the last heavy bomber group formed by the Army Air Forces. It trained with Consolidated B-24 Liberators at Wendover and at Mountain Home Army Air Field, Idaho.  In January and February 1944, a cadre of the squadron trained under simulated combat conditions at Orlando Army Air Base, Florida with the Army Air Forces Tactical Center, with aircrews filling out the squadron in March.  The air echelon began to receive new B-24Js in May and they began departing for Hawaii on 28 May. The ground echelon began its move to Hawaii on 1 June 1944.


==== Combat in the Pacific ====
The squadron remained at Barking Sands Army Air Field for additional training and modifications to its planes to meet theater standards until late September 1944, when it deployed to Angaur Airstrip in the Palau Islands. The squadron's ground echelon was initially involved with the construction of the base on Angaur. Although some unit aircrews flew combat missions with the 30th Bombardment Group from Saipan, the air echelon only began to arrive on Angaur on 24 October 1944, after the Seabees and Army engineers had prepared the airstrip for heavy bomber operations. The squadron finally conducted its first mission on 3 November, when it attacked Japanese airfields on Yap and Koror. It conducted attacks on Japanese military that had been bypassed as American forces had advanced in the Central Pacific.  It also attacked the Philippines, hitting gun emplacements, bivouacs, and storage depots on Corregidor and Caballo Islands at the entrance to Manila Bay.  It also attacked radio communications installations and power plants at Japanese bases in the Philippines; and attacked airfields, including Clark Field on Luzon. Early in 1945, the 866th struck ammunition and supply dumps in the Davao Gulf and Illana Bay areas of Mindanao and airfields on the island.The squadron moved to Okinawa in June 1945. From its base at Yontan Airfield it engaged primarily in attacks against enemy airfields on Kyūshū and around the Inland Sea of Japan until V-J Day. It also struck airfields in China and Korea.  The unit also participated in incendiary raids and dropped propaganda leaflets over urban areas of Kyūshū. On a combat mission to sink the last remaining Japanese battleship, the Haruna, moored off Etajima Island near Kure Harbor, Honshu, Japan, two of thirty-three B-24 bombers were brought down by flak over the target. Led by Emil Turek, first the Taloa, piloted by 1st Lt. Joseph Dubinsky, then the Lonesome Lady, piloted by 2nd Lt. Thomas C. Cartwright, were brought down near Hiroshima. Decades of research by Japanese historian Shigeaki Mori revealed that 12 American POWs, including men from Dubinsky's and Cartwright's crews were killed by the blast, fires, and radiation from the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. Cartwright and his tail gunner, William Abel survived and were liberated from Ōmori and Ōfuna prisoner-of-war camps. After the war's end, the 866th transported personnel and supplies from Manila to Tokyo.  In December, the squadron returned to the United States, where it was inactivated at the Vancouver Barracks Port of Embarkation on 7 January 1946.


=== Jupiter missile training ===
The squadron was redesignated the 866th Strategic Missile Squadron and activated at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama in September 1958.  Because the squadron's mission would be to train on the SM-78 Jupiter missile, it was stationed at the arsenal, which was the location of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, which had developed the Jupiter, even though the 866th's parent organization, the 1st Missile Division of Strategic Air Command (SAC) was located thousands of miles away at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California.   Although the Air Force had been given responsibility for the Jupiter by the Department of Defense. It became clear that it would not operate the missile, and in January 1960, the squadron became the 865th Technical Training Squadron.    The squadron was inactivated 25 May 1962, when responsibility for Jupiter missiles was turned over to Turkey. Plans had been developed to establish Jupiter units in the Turkish Air Force, but as a result of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the United States agreed not to deploy Jupiter missiles to Turkey.

Marie Woolfolk Taylor,"Marie Woolfolk Taylor (December 18, 1893 - November 9, 1960) was one of the sixteen founders of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated, the first sorority founded by African-American women. The legacy she created in establishing the sorority has continued to generate social capital for nearly 100 years.
Woolfolk did post-graduate study in the new field of social work and returned to Atlanta for her career. She worked as a social worker and probation officer, and chaired numerous civic groups, readily handling financial responsibilities. She was on the board of directors of a range of charities. Woolfolk considered herself mostly a social worker, but she also worked as an educator at night school.
With her commitment to community service and strong leadership in activities in a segregated city, Woolfolk  demonstrated how sororities could help women prepare ""to create spheres of influence, authority and power within institutions that traditionally have allowed African Americans and women little formal authority and real power.""


== Early life ==
Marie Woolfolk was born in Atlanta, Georgia. She attended Storrs School until graduation. This was one of the classical academic schools established in Atlanta for freedmen by missionaries from New England after the Civil War.
For one semester, Woolfolk attended Atlanta University to concentrate on higher level work. She entered Howard University's Preparatory School in 1901, from which she graduated in 1904. Woolfolk then felt  prepared to tackle Howard University, the top historically black college in the nation. It was a time when only 1/3 of 1% of African Americans and 5% of whites of eligible age attended any college.


== Howard University and founding of Alpha Kappa Alpha ==
In her later years as a college student at Howard, Woolfolk was heavily involved in planning Alpha Kappa Alpha. She helped design elements of the sorority in 1907. Together with Ethel Hedgeman Lyle, Woolfolk made official presentations in 1907 about the sorority to gain approval of Howard University officials — university president Wilbur P. Thirkield and deans Lewis Moore and Kelly Miller. She attended the inaugural meeting on January 15, 1908 and helped draft the sorority's first constitution and bylaws. Woolfolk  invited seven sophomores to participate in the sorority so they could begin expansion. On February 21, Woolfolk was elected the first secretary of Alpha Kappa Alpha.In addition, Woolfolk maintained an excellent academic record. She was a lyric soprano with the Howard University Chorus and participated in drama as well. Woolfolk graduated  with a Bachelor of Arts in English, magna cum laude, with honors in Latin and history.


== Career and later life ==
After graduating from Howard, Woolfolk enrolled at Cleveland, Ohio's Schauffler Training School for Social Service, where she majored in religion. At Schauffler Training School, Woolfolk was the only African-American student. Social work was a new field for the nation.After graduation, Woolfolk moved back to Atlanta. She gained a position as community assistant to the pastor of the First Congregational Church, the second oldest Black Congregational Church in the nation.  For seven years, she served in this position. Woolfolk also acted as a probation officer, working with delinquent girls for the City of Atlanta. She taught adult classes at night school. For four years, Woolfolk was the head of inspection for the African-American legal company Standard Life Insurance Company, which grew to be a major business in Atlanta.In her various positions, Woolfolk was among the first in her generation to be a social worker, as the new field was called. It developed as a progressive movement to help with massive social changes resulting from increased migration into cities, from the South to the North, and increased immigration from Europe. During the Great Atlanta Fire on May 21, 1917, Woolfolk was one of two African-Americans who assisted the Red Cross.In 1919, Woolfolk married Dr. Alfred G. Taylor and bore a daughter named Alfred Marie.Taylor was involved in leading a range of civic-related activities in Atlanta. She helped to organize the Community Chests, which preceded what is now the United Way. She chaired the Finance Committee of the YWCA. Taylor was on the board of directors of the Carrie Steele-Pitts Foster Home and the Community Planning Council. She was also an active member of the NAACP and the First Congregational Church.Continuing her involvement with Alpha Kappa Alpha, in 1923 Marie Taylor was chartering president of Atlanta's Kappa Omega alumnae chapter. She worked with this group to build the sorority's network among graduates in the city.Marie Woolfolk Taylor died in Atlanta, Georgia, on November 9, 1960.

Dojo,"A dōjō (道場, Japanese pronunciation: [doꜜː(d)ʑoː]) is a hall or place for immersive learning, experiential learning or meditation. This is traditionally in the field of martial arts, but has been seen increasingly in other fields, such as meditation and software development. The term literally means ""place of the Way"" in Japanese.


== History ==
The word dōjō originates from Buddhism. Initially, dōjō were adjunct to temples and were formal training places for any of the Japanese arts ending in ""-dō"", from the Chinese Dao, meaning ""way"" or ""path"". Sometimes meditation halls where Zen Buddhists practice zazen meditation were called dōjō. The alternative term zen-do is more specific, and more widely used. European Sōtō Zen groups affiliated with the International Zen Association prefer to use dōjō instead of zendo to describe their meditation halls as did their founding master, Taisen Deshimaru.
In Japan, any facility for physical training, including professional wrestling, may be called a dōjō. In the Western world, the term dōjō (when related to physical activity) is used exclusively for Japanese martial arts such as aikidō, jūdō, karate-dō, etc.


== In martial arts ==
A proper Japanese martial arts dōjō is considered special and is well cared for by its users. Shoes are not worn in a dōjō. In many styles it is traditional to conduct a ritual cleaning (sōji; 掃除) of the dōjō at the beginning and/or end of each training session. Besides the obvious hygienic benefits of regular cleaning it also serves to reinforce the fact that dōjō are supposed to be supported and managed by the student body (or by special students, e.g., uchi-deshi), not the school's instructional staff. This attitude has become lost in many modern dōjō that are founded and run by a small group of people or instructors. In fact, it is not uncommon that in traditional schools (koryu), dōjō are rarely used for training at all, instead being reserved for more symbolic or formal occasions. The actual training is conducted typically outdoors or in a less formal area.Many traditional dōjō follow a prescribed pattern with shomen (正面; ""front"") and various entrances that are used based on student and instructor rank laid out precisely. Typically students will enter in the lower-left corner of the dōjō (in reference to the shomen) with instructors in the upper right corner. Shomen typically contains a Shintō shrine with a sculpture, flower arrangement, or other artifacts. The term kamiza means ""place of honor"" and a related term, kamidana refers to the shrine itself. Other artifacts may be displayed throughout the dōjō, such as kanban (看板; signboard) that authorize the school in a style or strategy, and items such as taiko drums or armor (Ō-yoroi). It is not uncommon to find the name of the dōjō and the dōjō kun (roughly ""dōjō rules"") displayed prominently at shomen as well. Visitors may have a special place reserved, depending on their rank and station. Weapons and other training gear will normally be found on the back wall.


=== Honbu dōjō ===
A honbu dōjō (本部道場) is the central training facility and administrative headquarters of a particular martial arts style.
Some well-known dōjō located in Japan are:

Kodokan Judo Institute (Judo)
Aikikai Hombu Dōjō (Aikido)
Noma Dōjō (Kendo)
Nakazato Karate Weapons Gym (Shōrin-ryū Shōrinkan)


=== Other names for training halls ===
Other names for training halls that are equivalent to ""dōjō"" include the following:

Akhara (Indian martial arts)
Dojang (Korean martial arts)
Gelanggang (silat Melayu)
Heya (sumo)
Kalari (kalaripayat)
Sasaran (pencak silat)
Võ Đường (Viet vo dao)
Wuguan (wushu)


== In other fields ==
The term dōjō is also increasingly used for other forms of immersive-learning space. 


=== Zen Buddhism ===
The term dōjō is sometimes used to describe the meditation halls where Zen Buddhists practice zazen seated meditation. The alternative term zen-do is more specific, and more widely used.

Radionuclide identification device,"A radionuclide identification device (RID or RIID) is a small, lightweight, portable gamma-ray spectrometer used for the detection and identification of radioactive substances. It is available from many companies in various forms to provide hand-held gamma-ray  radionuclide identification.  Since these instruments are easily carried, they are suitable for first-line responders in key applications of Homeland Security, Environmental Monitoring and Radiological Mapping.  These devices have also found their usefulness in medical and industrial applications as well as a number of unique applications such as geological surveys.  In the past two decades RIIDs have addressed the growing demand for fast, accurate isotope identification.  These light-weight instruments require room temperature detectors so they can be easily carried and perform meaningful measurements in various environments and locations.


== ANSI Requirements ==
RIIDs are designed to meet American National Standards Institute (ANSI) requirements, N42.34.  These standards ensure a rugged design including water and shock resistance.  The requirements also include a large gamma energy range, detection of gamma and neutron sources, automatic system calibration and temperature stabilization.  These instruments include a specific ANSI library which contains a list of standard isotopes.  In addition, most RIIDs have a Medical and Industrial library.  Other custom libraries are often added to address specific applications required by some users.


== Detectors ==
Most RIIDs use scintillation detectors of various types and sizes.  The most common type of detector is Sodium Iodide (NaI(Tl)).  Other detector types with improved resolution, low background and thermal neutron detection are readily available.  Efficient detectors with good resolution are available in sizes up to and exceeding 3x3 inches.  The relative efficiency of germanium detectors (including other types of detectors) can be compared to a 3x3 NaI(Tl) detector as the standard, representing 100% relative efficiency.  This standard measurement is performed with a 60Co source (1332 keV at 25 cm yielding 1.2 cps/KBq).  Various measurements have shown that cerium bromide (CeBr3) has improved efficiency and resolution compared to NaI(Tl) with comparable low background.


== History of Neutron Detection ==
The discovery of the neutron was paramount to the development of atomic physics in the first half of the twentieth century. The essential nature of the atomic nucleus was established with the discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932. Detection of the neutron requires a special environment because neutrons do not typically cause ionization since they are not charged particles.  However, if the interaction of the neutron is with a nuclide of high neutron cross-section1 then a response to neutrons becomes probable.  Nuclides commonly used as neutron detector materials are helium-3 (3He), lithium-6 (6Li), boron-10 (10B) and uranium-235 (235U).  The detector material is surrounded by a moderator which reduces the kinetic energy of the neutron (slowing down the neutron).  Moderated neutrons are commonly called thermal neutrons providing a high probability of interaction with the target material.  
The following neutron detectors are discussed as the most common types used today.             
1 The neutron cross-section expresses the likelihood of interaction between an incident neutron and a target nucleus.    


=== Helium-3 (3He) Gas-Filled Proportional Detectors ===
3He was first proposed as a neutron detector in 1939.  It was first thought to be a radioactive isotope until samples of natural helium were found (which is mostly helium-4).  Helium is found just below the Earth’s crust in a ratio of 300 atoms of 3He per million atoms of 4He.
With no electrical charge, neutron interaction with atomic electrons is not possible (as in X-ray, gamma, electron or beta detectors). Therefore, we rely on interaction with an atomic nucleus.
The n + 3 He reaction is shown below with conservation of energy as:
                                  n + 3He → 3H + p + 764 keV
The energy of 764 keV is the sum of the proton kinetic energy of 573 keV plus the triton (tritium ion) kinetic energy of 191 keV.  This energy (charge) is collected as daughter products yielding an output pulse which is proportional to the 764 keV energy for thermal neutrons. 3He provides an efficient neutron detector when 3He reacts by absorbing thermal neutrons, producing a 1H (proton) and a 3H ion (tritium). Its sensitivity to gamma rays is negligible, providing a very useful neutron detector. Unfortunately, the supply of 3He is limited to production as a byproduct from the decay of tritium (which has a 12.3-year half-life); tritium is produced either as part of weapons programs as a booster for nuclear weapons or as a byproduct of reactor operation.  Therefore, the price of these detectors is somewhat high due to limited availability.


=== Lithium-6 (6Li) Neutron Detectors ===
Scintillating 6Li glass for neutron detection was first reported in 1957.  However, it was not until the early 1990s that major advances were made by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.  These new techniques were first classified and later declassified in 1994.
The scintillating glass fibers operate by combining 6Li and Cerium ions into the glass composition.  Since 6Li has a high cross-section for thermal neutron absorption this reaction will produce a tritium ion, an alpha particle and kinetic energy. The ionization produced is transferred to the cerium ions which results in an emission of photons with wavelength 390 to 600 nm.  This event results in a flash of light of several thousand photons for each neutron absorbed.  The glass fiber acts as a wave guide for the scintillation light which is coupled to a PMT.  Pulse shape discrimination (PSD) is then used to separate gamma and neutron events.
More recently a similar reaction with 6Li is used for neutron detection in CLYC detectors. The CLYC crystal uses 95% enriched 6Li and doped with cerium ions. This detector produces monoenergetic pulses above 3 MeV for thermal neutrons. This gamma/neutron separation is even further enhanced by PSD and algorithm improvements.  Other detectors like CLLBC are available and offer good gamma resolution and neutron separation up to gamma fields of 20 mR/h and higher.  Some detectors offer fast timing (~60 ns) so that a large dynamic range in counting rates is possible. 


== Gamma-ray Spectroscopy for Isotope Identification ==
Gamma rays were first discovered and studied in 1900 by a French chemist, Paul Villard, while observing radiation from radium. However, the fist quantitative analysis of gamma radiation is credited to Rutherford and Andrade in 1914.  This earliest technique was accomplished by diffraction spectroscopy using a rock-salt crystal.
Crystal diffraction is regarded as an important and pioneering effort in the analysis of gamma-ray energy but falls short of a means to accurately quantify and identify various radionuclides.  Therefore, we must wait several decades later to see achievements leading to what we know as gamma spectroscopy.  


=== Gamma-ray Spectroscopy ===
A spectrometer system for radionuclide analysis is composed of a photon detector and associated electronics (e.g., amplifier and pulse shaping) including a means of sorting various energy events and recording/displaying the data.  These events are sorted to produce a spectrum (histogram) displaying intensity (of events) as a function of photon energy.
The advent of the sodium-iodide scintillator  in 1948 and other detectors to follow became useful for spectroscopy.   The photon detector and the Multichannel Pulse-Height Analyzer (MCA) become the primary tools needed to produce a pulse-height spectrum of one or more radionuclides.  It is first necessary to derive a digital number that is proportional to the amplitude of the analog pulse.  This is performed in an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) which is a key part of the MCA. A number of linear and fast ADCs have been developed over the years (e.g., Wilkinson).  One of the first MCAs was developed by Fred Goulding in the 1950s, at the Atomic Energy of Canada, Chalk River facility.  This MCA was called a “Kicksorter” and boasted excellent linearity and 100 channels.  Goulding later worked at the Lawrence Berkeley Lab (1959) and brought some of the early nuclear counting technology to Berkeley and Livermore Labs.  Through later years a number of advances in MCAs have been impressive with 16K channel analyzers being common.  Improvements in nuclear detectors has brought improved energy resolution creating advancements in nuclear science.  In the early 1960s germanium (Ge) detectors were being developed with excellent energy resolution.  This work has continued with emphasis on high purity and larger ingots. Since these detectors are cooled to liquid nitrogen temperatures advancements in room temperature detectors have been necessary for small, portable instruments called Radioisotope Identification Devices (RIIDs).  With newer high-resolution scintillators, RIIDs have become excellent tools for Homeland Security and many other applications requiring spectroscopic identification of radioisotopes.
Berkeley Nucleonic Corporation (BNC) has been a leader in providing RIIDs for two decades.  BNC has implemented a number of techniques to enhance the accuracy, speed and sensitivity needed to quickly identify radioisotopes.  One of these techniques is called Quadratic Compression Conversion (QCC).  QCC is a digital conversion transform used to obtain excellent characterization of spectral peaks.  This allows sensitivity beyond conventional spectroscopy by spreading out tightly spaced low energy peaks and enhancing high energy peaks for faster and easier search of energy lines across the spectrum.  This is especially important for quick indication of highly enriched weapons grade material.  QCC is now incorporated in our new SAM 940+ RIID.  This light-weight, hand-held RIID uses some of the newest high-resolution detectors and the capability of auto updates of new software. 


== Additional Features ==
Some RIIDs have additional features not required by ANSI such as external probes for verification of Special Nuclear Material (SNM).One example is an external Pancake probe used in the detection of alpha and beta radiation.
Another beneficial feature which has existed for about 20 years is Quadratic Compression Conversion (QCC).  This feature adds sensitivity at higher energies for fast and improved verification of weapons grade material.  QCC is also beneficial at lower energies where closely spaced energy lines need sufficient separation to gain improved quantification across the whole energy spectrum.
One of the newer and very effective additions is a one click Reach-Back feature which automatically sends data files (including pictures and videos) to any Reach-Back center.

Quercus sinuata,"Quercus sinuata is a species of oak comprising two distinct varieties, Quercus sinuata var. breviloba and Quercus sinuata var. sinuata, occurring in southeast North America.


== Description ==
Quercus sinuata is a deciduous tree up to 20 metres (67 feet) tall. Leaves are narrow, with shallow rounded lobes. It tends to grow in wet habitats, such as on river bluffs, river bottoms, and flatwoods, and generally over basic substrates, such as mafic rocks, shells, or calcareous sediment.There are two varieties, with morphologically intermediate forms sometimes occurring where their ranges overlap:
Quercus sinuata var. breviloba (Torr.) C.H.Mull. – Texas, Oklahoma, Mexico
Quercus sinuata var. sinuata – Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Carolinas, Texas


== Common names ==
Perhaps arising from the classification challenges posed by a lack of morphological consistency among individuals of the species, the common name bastard oak may refer to either var. sinuata or var. breviloba or to any of their intermediate forms. The common names Durand oak and  Durand white oak most often refer to Quercus sinuata var. sinuata. Other common names for Quercus sinuata var. sinuata include bastard white oak and bluff oak, but these names more often refer to Quercus austrina. Common names for Quercus sinuata var. breviloba are Bigelow oak, Bigelow's oak, shallow-lobed oak, white shin oak, scaly-bark oak, limestone Durand oak, and shortlobe oak. Other common names include scrub oak or shin oak, but these names may refer to a number of other low growing, clump forming oak species, subspecies or varieties. For clear differentiation in common reference, American Forests uses Durand Oak to mean Quercus sinuata var. sinuata and Bigelow oak to mean Quercus sinuata var. breviloba, a shrubby variety of Quercus sinuata distinguished in part by its habit of forming clonal colonies in parts of its range.


== Distribution and habitat ==
Quercus sinuata var. breviloba is native to central and north central Texas, south central and southwest Oklahoma, and to Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas in northern Mexico. Quercus sinuata var. sinuata is native to the south-central and southeastern United States from central Texas and southwestern Arkansas to the Carolinas. Their respective ranges intersect in the Hill Country of central Texas, where streams flowing through dry, brushy limestone hills create a mosaic of wet and well drained habitats.

Flandreau Indian School,"Flandreau Indian School (FIS), previously Flandreau Indian Vocational High School, is an boarding school for Native American children (primarily Lakota) in unincorporated Moody County, South Dakota, adjacent to Flandreau. It is operated by the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) and is off-reservation.It is one of four such off-reservation boarding schools directly operated by the BIE. It offers grades 9-12. Established in 1872 as a Presbyterian mission school, it is the oldest continuously operating Indian boarding school in the United States.


== History ==
The Presbyterian Church established this as a mission school in 1872, serving grades 1-6. The federal government took over operations in 1877 and opened dormitories in 1892 for boarding students. High school classes were later added. In the 1940s the Lakota campaigned to close the school but it did not succeed. Since the mid-20th century, public school districts and tribally controlled schools have provided education to more Native American students. BIE funding decreased for this and similar schools after a change of rules in 2004. Many facilities were closed and staff were laid off.In the 19th and early 20th centuries, such federal boarding schools were intended to assimilate Native American students into the dominant Anglo-American culture: teaching English, Christianity, and European American culture. By the early 21st century, many federal schools had become centers of second chances, assisting students who were orphaned, had learning problems, or difficult home lives.


== Admissions ==
It is open to children who are members of federally recognized tribes. In 2002 the school admitted 95% of applicants. Those who were not admitted were generally limited to children with disabilities which the school could not accommodate.


== Operations ==
The federal government covers the cost of classes, room and board for students. This is part of its treaty obligations related to establishing the reservations and peace after the Indian Wars. 


== Student body ==
In 1972 there were about 600 students. In 2002 there were 370 students.In 2002 most students attending Flandreau were seeking environments more stable than those at home. Some are legacy students, with a history of other family members having attended. A third group seek a new environment for the ""adventure"", as Matt Baney of the Argus Leader reports.In 2015 Flandreau School had 279 students; while the majority were from South Dakota, there were 34 from Nebraska and 7 from Iowa.


== Athletics ==
The athletic teams are called the Indians. Erin Grace of the Omaha World-Herald wrote in 2015 that ""It is a word used gingerly around here.""In 1989 the school was in South Dakota athletics class AA.  It did not have an American football team. That year it requested to be in class A.

"Embassy of the United States, Budapest","The Embassy of the United States, Budapest is the diplomatic representation of the United States in Hungary, located in Budapest in the Fifth District, at 12 Liberty Square. The embassy is housed in the building of the Hungarian Commercial Hall, which was inaugurated in 1901. Since the summer of 2022, the embassy has been led by ambassador David Pressman.


== History ==
Hungary–United States relations on a diplomatic level began during the time of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The first American embassy was actually opened in Vienna, and the first American envoy presented his credentials on November 7, 1838. Diplomatic relations were severed during World War I, and the peace treaty between the two countries was signed on August 29, 1921. Only after that could discussions about opening separate diplomatic representations for Hungary and the USA commence. Even before this, the USA was not without representation in Hungary. On December 4, 1919, Ulysses Grant-Smith arrived in Hungary to represent the American government. Grant-Smith opened an office at 12 Lendvay Street, and his assignment was confirmed on January 27, 1920. The embassy was officially founded on December 26, 1921, with Ulysses Grant-Smith serving as the chargé d'affaires. He was succeeded by Theodore Brentano, who represented the United States from May 16, 1922, with the title of Minister Plenipotentiary.The embassy and consulate moved to 12 Imre Steindl Street (then: Árpád Street) in 1930. In 1933, negotiations began with the Hungarian Post Savings Bank for the lease of the nearby location at 12 Liberty Square. The embassy opened at this now-famous location on January 20, 1934, initially leasing the offices but eventually displacing all previous tenants. Budapest's fifth post office operated in the building from 1933 until 1947, when the Americans transitioned from tenants to owners.On December 13, 1941 Hungary declared war on the United States. However, United States Congress did not approve the state of war, and thus the embassy continued to operate. Envoy Herbert Pell left Hungary on January 16, 1942. The embassy building was temporarily entrusted to the Swiss, and was occupied by Consul Carl Lutz, who directed his humanitarian activities from there.
Following World War II, an American diplomat, Arthur Schoenfeld, arrived in Hungary in January 1945 as a representative of the Allied Control Commission. He was appointed as envoy on December 15, 1945, and presented his credentials on January 26, 1946. That same year, the Americans purchased the building on Liberty Square. During the Rákosi era, relations became increasingly strained, culminating in the expulsion of Ambassador Selden Chapin in 1949.During the autumn of 1956 a transition was occurring at the embassy. The new envoy, Edward T. Wailes, arrived in Budapest on November 2—two days ahead of Soviet tanks. Due to the unfolding events, he was unable to present his credentials, and ultimately didn't want to present them to the Revolutionary Workers'-Peasants' Government of Hungary. He was expelled in February 1957. In 1956, József Mindszenty sought and was granted asylum at the embassy. He lived there for nearly one and a half decades, unable to leave the building for fear of arrest.
During the Cold War years the embassy existed but due to tense relations, no ambassadors, only temporary chargés d'affaires, were stationed in the other country. The USA did not have an appointed ambassador in Hungary between 1957 and 1967. The relationship was further complicated by Mindszenty's presence in the embassy and the USA's foreign policy at the time (Vietnam War). It was not until 1966 that relations began to improve. Embassies were upgraded to ambassadorial status, and both countries finally sent ambassadors to lead their missions: the USA sent Martin J. Hillenbrand in 1967, and Hungary sent János Nagy in 1968.


== Carl Lutz Memorial ==
Carl Lutz was the Swiss Vice-Consul in Budapest from 1942 until the end of World War II in 1945. He worked out of the U.S. Legation building, which was located at 12 Liberty Square.Lutz's rescue efforts during the war are highly noted. He collaborated with other diplomats from neutral countries such as the Swedish Raoul Wallenberg, the Apostolic Nuncio Angelo Rotta, and the Italian Giorgio Perlasca. By declaring buildings as annexes of the Swiss legation, Lutz extended diplomatic immunity to 72 buildings across Budapest. As a result, more than 62,000 Hungarian Jews were saved from deportation to concentration camps.A statue commemorating Carl Lutz was unveiled on December 13, 2006, in a park adjacent to the U.S. Embassy at 12 Liberty Square. The ceremony was attended by Hungarian, Swiss, and American politicians, as well as representatives of the Jewish community. The memorial acknowledges Lutz's courageous actions that saved tens of thousands of Hungarian citizens persecuted as Jews during World War II.


== Statue of Harry Hill Bandholtz ==
On the eastern side of Liberty Square park, next to the Hungarian National Bank, stands a statue commemorating Brigadier General Harry Hill Bandholtz. Bandholtz, an officer in the United States Army, played a significant role as part of the Inter-Allied Military Mission tasked with overseeing the withdrawal of Romanian troops from Hungary in 1919 following the Hungarian–Romanian War.: p. xxii and xxviii The inscription on the statue, a quote from Bandholtz, reads: ""I simply carried out the instructions of my government, as I understood them, as an officer and a gentleman of the United States Army.""The statue was unveiled in 1936, created by renowned Hungarian sculptor Miklós Ligeti. It portrays Bandholtz holding a riding crop behind his back, a compromise reached due to Romanian objections to the statue. The riding crop signifies an incident on October 5, 1919, where Bandholtz stopped Romanian soldiers from entering the Hungarian National Museum and taking artifacts and treasures from within it. According to the Romanian military authorities occupying Hungary, they wanted the returning of the Transylvanian heritage assets from the museum that retreating Austro-Hungarian troops had previously taken from the region at the end of World War I, some of which were willingly returned as Bandholtz himself confirmed.Originally supported by the Horthy government, the statue was temporarily removed for ""restoration"" by the Communist government in the late 1940s. In the late 1980s, it was re-installed in the garden of the ambassadorial residence in Zugliget at the request of Ambassador Nicolas M. Salgo. It was finally returned to its original location in Liberty Square in July 1989, ahead of a visit from U.S. President George H. W. Bush.
Every year, on the anniversary of Bandholtz's birth, the American military attaché lays a memorial wreath in front of the statue.

Aujourd'hui,"Aujourd'hui (French: [oʒuʁdɥi], Today) was a daily newspaper which styled itself as ""independent"" and which was created in August 1940 by Henri Jeanson, to replace le Canard enchaîné under agreement with the Germans.
The first issue appeared on 10 September 1940.  In November 1940, the German authorities pressured the director into taking a public position against the Jews and in favour of politics of collaboration with the Vichy regime. Jeanson resigned, and was succeeded by the journalist Georges Suarez.
Aujourd'hui was far from innocent in its pursuit of those responsible for the 1940 defeat of France, resorting to the myth of the ""clean sweep of the broom"" in its notorious Anglophobia.  It began to reflect the narrative of Marshal Philippe Pétain and of German propaganda.  The paper was in favour of the Riom trials which were set up to punish the members of the pre-war government who were allegedly responsible for France's defeat in 1940.
Georges Suarez was shot in 1944.

Point Lookout State Park,"Point Lookout State Park is a public recreation area and historic preserve occupying Point Lookout, the southernmost tip of a peninsula formed by the confluence of Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac River in St. Mary's County, Maryland. The state park preserves the site of an American Civil War prisoner of war camp and the Point Lookout Light, which was built in 1830. It is the southernmost spot on Maryland's western shore, the coastal region on the western side of the Chesapeake Bay.


== Colonial period ==
Captain John Smith, the famed explorer who surveyed the Mid-Atlantic region for the British Crown, came ashore at Point Lookout in 1608. He surveyed the lands and waters of the area, including the mouth of the Potomac River on the south side of Point Lookout and its small nearby tributary, the St. Mary's River. Smith gave very favorable reports on the area to the king of England, remarking on the abundant game and fishing opportunities, the fertile soil and the strategic military value of the area, overlooking the confluence of the Potomac River, Patuxent River and the St. Mary's River, along with its key vantage point on the Chesapeake Bay itself. All of these factors led him to describe it as a prime spot for a potential British colony.
The first settlement in Maryland occurred in 1634, in nearby St. Mary's City. At that time, Point Lookout became part of St. Michael's Manor, one of the main holdings of Leonard Calvert, the leader of the new colony and the first proprietary governor of colonial Maryland.
Because of its strategic position, Point Lookout was raided by British forces during the American Revolution.


== War of 1812 ==


=== Origin of area name, ""Point Lookout"" ===
The area got its name from its role as a lookout post, used to watch British ship movements during the War of 1812.During the War of 1812 the Chesapeake Bay was a major route for British War ships, who established a naval and military base at near-by Tangier Island in Virginia for the Royal Navy under Rear Admiral George Cockburn with Fort Albion there, which constantly raided Chesapeake Bay waterfront towns, villages and farms and scattered community residents, and also eventually attacked and burned Washington, D.C., and unsuccessfully attacked the City of Baltimore during 1813 and 1814.


=== Citizen militia post riders ===
During the War of 1812, a local citizen militia in St. Mary's County established a clandestine base on Point Lookout to monitor movements of British warships on Chesapeake Bay. The militia also established a secret nighttime system of post riders to send intelligence reports from Point Lookout to Washington, D.C., in order to keep President James Madison up to date on British movements. St. Mary's County's roads were notoriously rough at the time, and the trek by horse was more than 80 miles, so a relay system was set up, passing messages from one rider to the next.


=== British forces take Point Lookout ===
The citizen militia worked clandestinely in the area for over a year, until the British came ashore, seized and occupied Point Lookout. The militia was no match for the overwhelming power and number of seasoned British ground troops. This had the effect of blinding American intelligence efforts in the region, and is thought to have contributed to the eventual Burning of Washington in August 1814 by British troops. President Madison and United States Secretary of War, John Armstrong, Jr.  was later faulted for not aiding the militia in Point Lookout.


== American Civil War ==


=== Establishment of prisoner-of-war camp ===

In 1862, during the American Civil War, much of the land around Point Lookout was transformed into a bustling port and temporary city of civilians and military personnel and numerous buildings, including a large Union Army hospital, a United States Army garrison at Fort Lincoln, and a Union prisoner of war camp to hold Confederate States Army soldier captives.


=== Prisoners of war held, conditions ===
At the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, Union forces captured thousands of Confederate soldiers.  Point Lookout was one of numerous military facilities hastily established as prisoner of war camps. Officially named Camp Hoffman, the 40-acre prison compound was established north of Hammond Hospital.  A 15-foot tall wooden fence surrounded the compound, while guards kept watch from a gallery at the top of the fence.According to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, of the 50,000 soldiers held in the army prison camp at Lookout Point, all of whom were housed in tents, nearly 4,000 died. The death rate of 8 percent was less than half of the death rate among soldiers who were in the field with their own armies. The camp, originally built to hold 10,000 men, swelled to between 12,000 and 20,000 prisoners after the exchange of prisoners between armies was placed on hold.  The result was crowded conditions with up to sixteen men to a tent in poor sanitary conditions. It was the largest Union-run prison camp and its reputation was one of the worst.


== War memorial and cemetery ==


=== Mass grave ===
The mass grave holds 3,384 Confederate prisoners of war who died at the prison camp. The grave is marked by a pillar inscribed at its base with the names of the dead. The privately funded Confederate Memorial Park occupies a three-acre site next to the cemetery. Although a United States flag is flown in front of the memorial, a prominent Confederate flag is situated on a flagpole just outside the gates of the grounds, in memory of those dead Southern soldiers.


=== Archeological remains ===
Because of the extensive water erosion of the Chesapeake Bay shoreline in the last 150 years, half of the original site of the prisoner of war stockade has been obliterated and washed away by the bay.


== State park and beaches ==
Today, Point Lookout State Park retains Point Lookout Light, the original lighthouse built in 1830, a fishing pier, boat launch facilities, public beaches and facilities, overnight camping, Civil War historical remains, and, reputedly, ghosts.


== Notable people ==
Sidney Lanier, poet, musician, and academic was a Confederate prisoner of war at Point Lookout.

Argus As II,"The Argus As II was a six-cylinder, in-line, water-cooled, aircraft engine produced in Germany by Argus Motoren in 1914.
The Argus As II produced 120 hp (89 kW) at 1,350 rpm.


== Design and development ==
The Argus As II was a major redesign compared to the preceding Argus 120/130 hp and Argus 140/150 hp six-cylinder engines.
Alongside many other changes, the major improvements were the introduction of newly designed steel cylinders and the completely redesigned crankcase, which now had an integrated oil pump and a completely modernized lubrication system.  
The cylinders were machined from steel separately, with intake and exhaust ducts as well as cooling jackets welded in place in a separate step.
While the steel cylinders were still combined to pairs, sharing the same cooling jacket, the change to steel cylinders was accompanied by a change in the design of the intake ducts and the pushrod arrangement.
Contrary to the old design, which had the two intake ducts conjoined into a single one, the new design had separate intake ducts for each cylinder.
This also necessitated a slight change in the valvetrain, with the two pushrods now placed separately to both sides of the intake duct, instead of both pushrods being placed at one side of the combined intake duct in the older design.
Also the number of mounting bolts for the cylinders has been increased, with each cylinder pair now being held to the crankcase by ten bolts.
Cast iron cylinders like in the previous engine design were also available, although in updated form to match the redesigned engine parts (i.e. separate intake ducts, new pushrod arrangement and increased number of crankcase mounting bolts).The intake manifold had been adapted to match the new arrangement of intake ducts on the cylinders. 
Two Cudell-G.A.-carburettors were placed centrally on the left side of the engine in close proximity to each other.
A heating jacket, integrated into the coolant circulation, enclosed both carburettors.
Each carburettor fed into one of the two separate intake manifold pipes, which fed three cylinders each.
The crankcase was made of aluminum and cast in separate upper and lower half parts, with the upper half having mounting arms cast into it.
The crankshaft was supported by two intermediate and two outer plain bearings, with additional thrust ball bearings at the propeller end.
The propeller had an increased clearance to the first cylinder due to the conical nose of the crankcase at the propeller end necessary to hold the bearings.
Lubrication was forced, with a piston pump located mid engine at the bottom of the crankcase, collecting and recirculating the oil from the crankcase.
Small amounts of fresh oil were augmented by the piston pump automatically.
The oil was fed to the main journals of the crankshaft, from where it was passed into the hollowed out crankshaft and then to the crankpins via drilled oil passages.
The oil also was further distributed to the connecting rods piston end via copper oil conduits.
The camshaft was driven from the crankshaft via an intermediate spur gear on the control end, and two additional vertical layshafts, both driven from the crankshaft via bevel gears, were used to drive the magnetos and the water- as well as the oil pump.
The centrifugal water pump, located on the lower end, was driven directly from the lower layshaft, while the oil pump was driven from the lower layshaft via bevel gears and an additional horizontal driveshaft and worm gear.
The upper layshaft provided the tachometer output and also was used to drive the two magnetos, which were mounted transversely and driven via separate bevel gears.

Clan Murray,"Clan Murray () is a Highland Scottish clan. The chief of the Clan Murray holds the title of Duke of Atholl. Their ancestors were the Morays of Bothwell who established the family in Scotland in the 12th century. In the 16th century, descendants of the Morays of Bothwell, the Murrays of Tullibardine, secured the chiefship of the clan and were created Earls of Tullibardine in 1606. The first Earl of Tullibardine married the heiress to the Stewart earldom of Atholl and Atholl therefore became a Murray earldom in 1626. The Murray Earl of Atholl was created Marquess of Atholl in 1676 and in 1703 it became a dukedom. The marquess of Tullibardine title has continued as a subsidiary title, being bestowed on elder sons of the chief until they succeed him as Duke of Atholl.
The Murray chiefs played an important and prominent role in support of William Wallace and Robert the Bruce during the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 13th and 14th centuries. The Murrays also largely supported the Jacobite House of Stuart during the Jacobite risings of the 18th century. Clan Murray hold the unique position of commanding the only private army in Europe known as the Atholl Highlanders.


== History ==


=== Origins of the Clan ===

The progenitor of the Clan Murray was Freskin who lived during the twelfth century. It has been claimed that he was Pictish but it is much more likely that he was a Flemish knight, one of a ruthless group of warlords who were employed by the Norman kings to pacify their new realm after the Norman conquest of England. David I of Scotland who was brought up in the English court, employed such men to keep hold of the wilder parts of his kingdom and granted to Freskin lands in West Lothian. The ancient Pictish kingdom of Moray (Moireabh in Scottish Gaelic) was also given to Freskin and this put an end to the remnants of that old royal house. In a series of astute political moves Freskin and his sons intermarried with the old house of Moray to consolidate their power. Freskin's descendants were designated by the surname de Moravia (""of Moray"" in the Norman language) and this became 'Murray' in the Lowland Scottish language. The original Earls of Sutherland (chiefs of Clan Sutherland) descend from Freskin's eldest grandson, Hugh de Moravia, whereas the chiefs of Clan Murray descend from Freskin's younger grandson, William de Moravia.Sir Walter Murray became Lord of Bothwell in Clydesdale thanks to a marriage to an heiress of the Clan Oliphant. He was a regent of Scotland in 1255. He also started construction of Bothwell Castle, which became one of the most powerful strongholds in Scotland. It was the seat of the chiefs of Clan Murray until 1360 when it passed over to the Clan Douglas.


=== Wars of Scottish Independence ===
During the Wars of Scottish Independence, Andrew Moray took up the cause of Scottish independence against Edward I of England and he was joined by William Wallace. Andrew Moray was killed following the Scottish victory at the Battle of Stirling Bridge in 1297, after which Wallace assumed command of Scottish forces. It has been suggested that the whole war might have taken a different course if Moray had survived the battle at Stirling Bridge as he had shown significant skill in pitched battle, which Wallace lacked. His son was Sir Andrew Murray, 4th Lord of Bothwell and third Regent of Scotland who married Christian Bruce, a sister of king Robert the Bruce. This Andrew Murray fought at the Battle of Halidon Hill in 1333.The lordship of Bothwell passed to the Douglases in 1360 when the fifth Murray Lord of Bothwell died of plague and his wife, Joan (herself daughter to Maurice de Moravia, Earl of Strathearn), took Archibald the Grim, Lord of Galloway and later Earl of Douglas, as her second husband.


=== 15th- and 16th-century clan conflicts ===
The Murray's feuds with their neighbours were not as numerous as those of many other clans. However, one incident of note, the Battle of Knockmary in 1490 pitted Murrays of Auchtertyre against the Clan Drummond. In 1562, at the Battle of Corrichie, Clan Murray supported Mary, Queen of Scots against George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly.There were many branches of the Clan Murray who disputed the right to the chiefship. It was not until the 16th century that the Murrays of Tullibardine are recorded as using the undifferenced arms of Murray in 1542, in a work that pre-dates the establishment of the Lord Lyon's register of 1672 and is considered of equal authority. The claim to the chiefship by the Murrays of Tullibardine rested upon their descent from Sir Malcom, sheriff of Perth in around 1270 and younger brother of the first Lord of Bothwell. The Murrays of Tullibardine consolidated their position as chiefs with two bands of association in 1586 and 1598 in which John Murray, later the first Earl of Tullibardine, was recognized as chief by numerous Murray lairds including the Morays of Abercairny in Perthshire who were amongst the signatories.In the bond of 1586 it is stated, ""with the hail name of Murray and others undersubscribing""....""as God forbid, the offendar to be object to (by) the rest, and accounted from thencefurth enemy to them all..."" and signed by: Sir John Murray of Tullibardine, Knight, Sir Andrew Murray of Aryngosk, William Moncrieff of that ilk, Robert Murray of Abercairny, Johnne Murray of Tibbermuir, James Murray of Pardens, William Murray of Airlywith, Alexander Murray  of Airlywith, Johne Murray of Strowane, James Murray, Fiar of Strowane, David Murray, apparand of Letterbanachie, Patrick Murray of Ochtertyre, William Murray of Pitcairles, Alexander Murray of Drumdeway, Patrik Murray of Raith, William Murray, apparand of Abercairny, Mungow Murray of Fedalis, David Murray of Raith, Andro Murray of Lacok, Humphra Murray of Buchanty, Hew, son to Wm Moncrieff of that ilk, David Murray, Howmichael.In 1594 the Murrays fought on the side of Archibald Campbell, 7th Earl of Argyll, chief of Clan Campbell at the Battle of Glenlivet against George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly, chief of Clan Gordon.The bond of 1598 is styled a ""Bond of Association of the Name Murray"" and is signed by Sir John Murray of Tulibardin, James Murray (younger) of Cockpuill, Blackbarony, Mr William Murray, Parson of Dysart, Androw Moray of Balvaird, Patrick Murray of Falahill, William Murray (younger) of Pomauis, Johne Morray, portioner of Arby, Antone Murray of Raith, Patrick Morray of Lochlan, Alexander Murray of Drumdeway, Colonel, John Murray of Tibbermuir, William Murray, appirand of Tullibardin, William Moray of Ochtertyre, (William) Murray of Abercairnay, Alexander Murray of Woodend, Walter Murray, portioner of Drumdeway, Johne Murray, portioner of Kinkell.


=== 17th century and civil war ===
In the early 17th century a deadly feud broke out between the Murrays of Broughton and Clan Hannay which resulted in the Hannays being outlawed.Sir John Murray of Tullibardine, 1548-1613, who was created first Earl of Tullibardine in 1606, married Catherine Drummond and Elizabeth Haldane. His son William Murray, 2nd Earl of Tullibardine married Dorothea Stewart, heiress to the Earls of Atholl. The Stewart earldom of Atholl became a Murray earldom in 1629 and a marquessate in 1676.The chief of Clan Murray, James Murray, 2nd Earl of Tullibardine, was initially a strong supporter of King Charles I, receiving the leader of the royalist army, James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose at Blair Castle in 1644, and he raised no fewer than eighteen hundred men to fight for the king. It was this addition of men that won Montrose the Battle of Tippermuir in 1644.


=== 18th century and Jacobite risings ===
In 1703 the Murrays as Earls and Marquesses of Atholl were created Dukes of Atholl, reaching the pinnacle of the peerage.


==== War in France ====
John Murray, Marquis of Tullibardine was killed fighting for the British at the Battle of Malplaquet (1709), a major conflict of the War of the Spanish Succession between France and a British-Dutch-Austrian alliance. In 1745, Lord John Murray's Highlanders fought for the British against the French at the Battle of Fontenoy.


==== Jacobite rising of 1715 ====
During the Jacobite rising of 1715 the Atholl men (Clan Murray) consisted of 1400 men who were formed into four regiments that were each commanded by William Murray, Marquess of Tullibardine, Lord Charles Murray (younger son of John Murray, 1st Duke of Atholl), Lord George Murray and William Murray, 2nd Lord Nairne. During the Battle of Sheriffmuir, Tullibardine did duty as Major-General of the whole Jacobite army with his battalion of Athollmen having been put under the temporary command of his cousin, John Lyon, 5th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, whose own regiment had gone to England under Brigadier McIntosh. The battle was indecisive as although the Jacobite army's right wing had defeated the Government's left, the Government army's right wing had also defeated the Jacobite left and so both sides claimed victory.


==== Jacobite rising of 1719 ====
At the Battle of Glen Shiel in 1719 men of Clan Murray fought under William Murray, Marquess of Tullibardine against the Government in support of the Jacobite cause. Tullibardine was wounded but escaped to France. The following month the Government put up a proclamation offering £2000 for his apprehension. On 25 July 1745 he landed with the Young Pretender, (Charles Edward Stuart), at Borodale, Scotland to launch the Jacobite rising of 1745. General Wade's report on the Highlands in 1724, estimated the clan strength, of the Athol men, at 2,000.


==== Jacobite rising of 1745 ====

The first Duke of Atholl's younger son was Lord George Murray, a Jacobite general who was the architect of the early Jacobite successes of the Jacobite rising of 1745. Most military historians concur that if Lord George Murray had been given the sole command of the Jacobite army that the Old Pretender (James Francis Edward Stuart) might well have gained his throne. Lord George's elder brother, the next duke, supported the British-Hanoverian Government, and George's half-brother, Lord John Murray, was made Colonel of the 43rd Regiment of Foot (later the 42nd), in April, 1745. As a result, at the Battle of Prestonpans in September, 1745, there were Murray regiments on both sides. Lord George Murray would go on to lead the Jacobite charge at the Battle of Falkirk (1746) and the Battle of Culloden (1746). He died in exile in the Netherlands in 1760.
AftermathAfter Culloden, on 27 April 1746, William Murray, Marquess of Tullibardine, who had landed with the Jacobite leader, Charles Edward Stuart in Scotland, suffering from bad health and fatigue, surrendered to a Mr Buchannan of Drummakill. He was taken to the Tower of London, where he died on 9 July. Lord George Murray escaped to the continent in December 1746, and was received in Rome by the Prince's father, the ""Old Pretender"" (James Francis Edward Stuart), who granted him a pension. Despite this, when Murray journeyed to Paris the following year, the Prince refused to meet with him. Murray lived in numerous places on the continent over the next years, and died in Medemblik, Holland, on 11 October 1760, at the age of 66. John Murray of Broughton who had been secretary to Prince Charles Edward Stuart earned the enmity of the Jacobites by turning king's evidence.


== Atholl Highlanders ==

Although the Battle of Culloden was the last time the Highlanders of Atholl went to war, the Murray chief's ceremonial guard which became known as the Atholl Highlanders still has the unique honour of being Europe's only legal private army. In 1845 Queen Victoria presented colours to the Atholl Highlanders.


== Castles ==
Castles that have been owned by the Clan Murray have included amongst many others:

Blair Castle is the current seat of the chief of Clan Murray, the Duke of Atholl. The castle is in fact now a large white-washed mansion that incorporates part of an old thirteenth century castle. The Clan Comyn once had a stronghold at Blair Castle and the property was then owned by the Stewart Earls of Atholl, but in 1629 it passed by marriage to the Murrays who became Earls, Marquesses and Dukes of Atholl. During the Scottish Civil War, James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose used Blair Castle as a mustering point before the Battle of Tippermuir. In 1653 the castle was besieged, captured and partially destroyed with gunpowder by the forces of Oliver Cromwell. However, the castle was still complete enough for the Earl of Atholl to try and recapture it in the following year. John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee (Bonnie Dundee of Claverhouse) garrisoned the castle and his body was brought back there after he was killed at the Battle of Killiecrankie in 1689. During the Jacobite rising of 1745 Charles Edward Stuart (Bonnie Prince Charlie) stayed at the castle. However, the following year the castle was occupied by British-Hanoverian forces and it was then besieged and damaged by Jacobites under Lord George Murray and as such is the last castle in Britain to have been besieged. (See: Siege of Blair Castle). In 1787 the castle was visited by Robert Burns. The castle is also home to the Atholl Highlanders who have their yearly spring gathering there. Although Blair Castle is still the seat of the Duke of Atholl, chief of Clan Murray he now lives in South Africa, but the castle is open to the public.
Bothwell Castle, a few miles north-west of Hamilton, South Lanarkshire was a property of the Murrays (or Morays) from the middle of the twelfth century and it had passed to them from the Clan Oliphant. During the Wars of Scottish Independence Bothwell Castle changed hands between the English and the Scots on several occasions and held a strategic position. The castle was the headquarters of the English Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke but was surrendered to the Scots in 1314. The keep was demolished at this time and although it was later made defensible it was never restored to its former glory. The castle was rebuilt by Edward Balliol but in around 1337 it was taken by the Scots and again slighted by Sir Andrew Murray. The last Murray laird of the castle died of plague in about 1360 and the property passed to the Earl of Douglas, then to the Douglas Earls of Angus, then to the Hepburn Earls of Bothwell, then back to the Douglas Earls of Forfar.
Ormond Castle also known as Avoch Castle, three miles south-west of Fortrose on the Black Isle was formerly in Moray and a property of the Murrays. It was once a strong castle but little remains. Sir Andrew Murray died at Ormond Castle in 1338 and the lands went to the Douglases.
Tullibardine Castle was about two miles north of Auchterarder, Perthshire and was a large building. The nearby Tullibardine Chapel was founded by Sir David Murray of Tulliebardine in 1446 and has been used as a burial place by the Murrays since the Protestant Reformation. The chapel is now in the care of Historic Scotland and is open to the public. The castle was a property of the Murrays from 1284 and Andrew Murray of Tullibardine supported Edward Balliol, playing an important part in the victory at the Battle of Dupplin Moor, and as a result he was executed for treason in 1332. The Murrays of Tullibardine later fought at the Battle of Flodden in 1513, supported Mary, Queen of Scots and turned against her when she married the Earl of Bothwell. Sir John Murray was made Earl of Tullibardine in 1606 and this title was advanced to Marquess of Tullibardine in 1676. William Murray, Marquess of Tullibardine supported the Jacobite risings of 1715, 1719 and 1745, and he died in captivity in the Tower of London in 1746.
Huntingtower Castle north-west of Perth is a well-preserved castle that consists of two towers; one from the fifteenth century and one from the sixteenth century. The castle was originally held by the Clan Ruthven and was known as Ruthven Castle, but the property was forfeited and the Ruthven name was proscribed following the Gowrie Conspiracy in 1660. The property then went to William Murray, Earl of Dysart, then to the Murrays of Tullibardine and then to the Murray Marqueses and Dukes of Atholl. Huntingtower Castle was the birthplace of the Jacobite Lord George Murray. It was sold to the Mercers in 1805 but is now in the care of Historic Scotland and is open to the public.
Balvaird Castle, four miles south of Bridge of Earn, Perthshire is a well preserved L-plan tower house that originally belonged to the Clan Barclay but passed to the Murrays of Tullibardine in 1500, and part of the feudal Lordship and Barony of Balvaird.
Scone Palace two miles north of Perth dates from 1802 but incorporates older work that possibly dates from 1580. The kings of Scots were inaugurated at Scone. After the Reformation, Scone had gone to the Ruthvens but after the Gowrie Conspiracy mentioned above it was granted to the Murrays as Sir David Murray of Gospertie had been one of those who had saved the king's life during the conspiracy. These Murrays were made Viscounts of Stormont in 1602 and Earls of Mansfield in 1776. In 1716 James Francis Edward Stuart held court at Scone and James Murray, second son of the fifth Viscount supported the Jacobites, escaping to France.
Comlongon Castle, eight miles south-east of Dumfries was held by the Murrays of Cockpool from 1331. It is a substantial keep and tower that rises five storeys and stands alongside a castellated mansion.


== Clan chief ==
Clan chief: Bruce Murray, 12th Duke of Atholl, Marquess of Atholl, Marquess of Tullibardine, Earl of Atholl, Earl of Tullibardine, Earl of Strathtay and Strathardle, Viscount of Balquhidder, Viscount of Glenalmond, Lord Murray of Tullibardine.


== Badges and crest ==
The current Clan badge, (see above), depicts a demi-savage (the upper half of a wreathed, shirtless man) holding a dagger in his right hand and a key in his left. The Clan motto reads Furth, Fortune, and Fill the Fetters, meaning, roughly, go forth against your enemies, have good fortune, and return with captives. The demi-savage badge was favoured by the late Duke of Atholl; the Clan continues to use it out of respect.
An older badge depicts a mermaid holding a mirror in one hand and a comb in the other, with the motto Tout prêt, Old French for all ready. This badge is found in many historical and heraldic sources, and remains a valid Murray device.

Union station (TTC),"Union is a subway station on Line 1 Yonge–University of the Toronto subway in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It opened in 1954 as one of twelve original stations on the first phase of the Yonge line, the first rapid transit line in Canada. It was the southern terminus of the line until the opening of the University line in 1963, and is today the inflection point of the U-shaped line. Along with Spadina station, it is one of two stations open overnight to support late-night streetcar routes.Union station is located on Front Street between the Yonge Street and University Avenue sections of the line. It is named for and directly connects to the railway station and regional bus terminal of the same name, serving all GO Transit train lines and train-bus services as well as Via Rail intercity routes (including Amtrak's Maple Leaf service to New York City). It connects to the Union Pearson Express (UPX), a dedicated rail link to Toronto Pearson International Airport. It is the only subway station with a direct connection to Via services.
Based on Toronto's street grid, Union is the southernmost subway station and the closest to Lake Ontario; however, using standard compass directions, Kipling and Islington stations are further south. It serves approximately 100,000 people a day, ranking it as the fourth-busiest station in the system, after Bloor–Yonge, St. George, and Sheppard–Yonge, and the busiest served by only one line. Adjacent to the subway station is an underground terminal loop for the 509 Harbourfront and 510 Spadina streetcar.
In 2007, Union subway station became the first location on the TTC where Presto cards could be used, as part of a trial. Wi-Fi service has been available at this station since 2014.


== History ==
The station opened as the southern terminus of the original Yonge subway line on March 30, 1954.
On February 28, 1963, Union became a through station with the opening of the University section of the Yonge–University line.
On June 22, 1990, Union became the terminus of route 604 Harbourfront LRT, now part of the 509 Harbourfront and 510 Spadina streetcar routes. A new underground streetcar platform was built south of the subway tracks, connected to the station concourse by a 30-metre pedestrian tunnel and a flight of stairs.Elevators were installed in 1996, making Union one of the first wheelchair-accessible subway stations in Toronto. An elevator was added to the streetcar platforms, even though streetcars were not accessible themselves.  By the time accessible streetcars began serving the station in 2014, the elevator had been replaced as a part of the station expansion.On August 18, 2014, a second subway platform was opened to serve Yonge line trains, leaving the existing platform to serve only University line trains.


=== Station expansion ===
In 2003, planning began on a station expansion to address overcrowding in the station. Despite being one of the busiest stations in the system, the station had only one narrow island platform serving both the University and Yonge lines, and a small concourse area.
The plan was to build a new subway platform on the south side of the tracks to serve the Yonge portion of the line, leaving the existing island platform to serve only the University portion. This new platform would feature a step-free connection to the streetcar platform. The project also included an expansion of the concourse level, the replacement of all finishes and signage, installation of public art, as well as improved connections to the adjacent Union Station and the PATH network.At a cost of $137 million, construction began in February 2011, with the new second platform opening on August 18, 2014. The project was completed in 2015 with the completion of the station renovation.In 2019, as part of the rebuilding and expansion of the adjacent Union Station, large glass canopies were installed in the ""moat"" that connects the subway station to the rest of the Union station complex. This weather-protected route connecting to the main concourses at Union Station ensures that commuters do not need to go outside when entering or leaving the TTC station.


== Station decor ==
When the station opened in 1954, the wall coverings were glossy yellow Vitrolite tiles with red lettering and trim, and the station name on the walls was in the TTC's unique Toronto Subway Font. During renovations in the 1980s, the yellow Vitrolite tiles were replaced with brown ceramic tiles and vinyl siding, and the station font was changed to Univers.
The 2011 to 2015 station expansion replaced these tiles and panels with white tiles and black trim, and the font used to render the station name was returned to its original Toronto Subway typeface.As part of the second platform project, a glass wall was built to block off the southern side of the old platform, since it now only serves the University line. It features the art piece ""Zones of Immersion"" by Stuart Reid, a professor at the OCAD University The work comprises 166 large glass panels, each measuring more than one by two metres, extending 170-metre (560 ft) along the length of the platform. Mostly transparent, it is visible from both the Yonge and University platforms. Each panel contains images or words, many based on sketches that Reid drew while riding the subway. Public reaction towards the art piece has been mixed, with some users of the station finding it ""tragic"" or ""dark and depressing"".


== Subway infrastructure in the vicinity ==
The station lies on an east–west axis along Front Street. It is one of three stations on Line 1 with an east–west orientation, the others being St. George and Downsview Park. Leaving the station eastbound, the Yonge leg of the line runs briefly under Front Street and turns 90 degrees north to run under Yonge Street; leaving westbound, the University leg also runs under Front Street, and shortly after turns 90 degrees north to run under University Avenue.

Union Station Loop is located underground at the north end of a 500 m (1,600 ft) tunnel running under Bay Street through the underground Queens Quay station from the street Queens Quay. The loop runs anticlockwise on a single track along a curved platform. An underground passage connects the streetcar platform to the Yonge subway platform. Union Station Loop is the eastern terminus of the 509 Harbourfront and southern terminus of the 510 Spadina streetcar route. The loop has a minimum radius of curvature of 14.5 m (48 ft).A 2017 TTC report stated that the streetcar loop would become inadequate for the volume of customers it handled because of its single track and its curved, narrow platform. The loop would not be able to handle the peak demand of 3700 people per hour projected for 2041. A 2010 environmental assessment for the East Bayfront LRT (a proposed streetcar line) approved rebuilding the existing streetcar loop plus the construction of a connection from the streetcar tunnel to the East Bayfront LRT on Queens Quay East. The LRT design would have rebuilt the loop to have four platforms, each with a bypass track, so that a streetcar could bypass other streetcars loading or unloading. Expansion of the loop's capacity would be needed in order to support an East Bayfront LRT. In 2017, conversion of the tunnel under Bay Street to operate a funicular shuttle to Queens Quay station instead of streetcars was considered but ultimately rejected.: 8–9  As of 2021, the conversion of the streetcar loop into a four-platform configuration is in the design stage.

Higonokami,"A higonokami (肥後守) is a type of folding pocket knife originating in Miki, Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan in 1896.  The knife has no locking system, but is a friction folder or ""penny knife"", using the friction of the swivel or the pressure of the user's thumb on its iconic lever or chikiri, to prevent the knife from folding during use. The handle of the Higonokami is made of a folded over sheet of metal. The handle is stamped with the name of the maker of the knife and the steel used in the blade. A distinguishing feature is that the blade has a flat grind without a secondary bevel.


== Etymology ==
The kanji used to spell Higonokami (肥後守) in Japanese means the ""Governor of Higo"". This was the most senior administrative position or Kokushi who governed Higo (肥後国), an old province on the island of Kyūshū, which is now in present-day Kumamoto Prefecture. Within the Taihō Code, Kami (長官) was the highest of four titles of shitōkan (四等官) in the ""four-ranked officials"" system, the others being suke (次官), jō (判官) and sakan (主典). The shitōkan enforced the historical law system known as Ritsuryō. Kami can be spelled in numerous ways depending on the government agency; in the case of the Kokushi (国司, ""Governor's Office""), the kanji is 守 which literally means ""protector"".


== History ==
The knife first appeared in 1896 as a result of smiths and metal workers struggling in post-samurai Japan following the major reform of the country made by Emperor Meiji in the late 19th century. With the abolition of the samurai class, the decline in demand for swords required diversification into tools and knives. The pocketknives became very successful and popular in Japan. But sales went into decline after harsher knife legislation was enacted in Japan in 1961 following the fatal stabbing of Japanese politician Inejirō Asanuma a year earlier.
The name ""Higonokami"" is now trademarked by the Miki Custom Knife Guild in Miki City near Osaka, and it decides which brands can be associated with the name. However, only one fifth-generation manufacturer KaneKoma (from its Nagao Kanekoma Factory in Miki) is legally allowed to call its knives exclusively ""Higonokami"". Other knifemakers of traditional style or modernized versions of Higonokami must refer to their products as ""Higo"" or ""Higonokami-style"".

Shirley Temple,"Shirley Temple Black (born Shirley Jane Temple; April 23, 1928 – February 10, 2014) was an American actress, singer, dancer, and diplomat, who was Hollywood's number-one box-office draw as a child actress from 1934 to 1938. Later, she was named United States Ambassador to Ghana and Czechoslovakia, and also served as Chief of Protocol of the United States.
Temple began her film career in 1931 when she was three years old and was well-known for her performance in Bright Eyes, which was released in 1934. She won a special Juvenile Academy Award in February 1935 for her outstanding contribution as a juvenile performer in motion pictures during 1934 and continued to appear in popular films through the remainder of the 1930s, although her subsequent films became less popular as she grew older. She appeared in her last film, A Kiss for Corliss, in 1949.In 1958, Temple returned to show business with a two-season television anthology series of fairy tale adaptations called Shirley Temple's Storybook, which was very popular at the time. She sat on the boards of corporations and organizations, including the Walt Disney Company, Del Monte Foods, and the National Wildlife Federation.
She began her diplomatic career in 1969, when she was appointed to represent the U.S. at a session of the United Nations General Assembly, where she worked at the U.S. Mission under Ambassador Charles Yost. Later, she was named U.S. Ambassador to Ghana, and also served as the first female U.S. Chief of Protocol. In 1988, she published her autobiography, Child Star. After her biography was published, she served as the U.S. Ambassador to Czechoslovakia (1989–1992).
Temple was the recipient of numerous awards and honors, including the Kennedy Center Honors and a Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award. She is 18th on the American Film Institute's list of the greatest female American screen legends of classic Hollywood cinema.


== Early years ==
Shirley Jane Temple was born on April 23, 1928 at Santa Monica Hospital (now UCLA Medical Center) in Santa Monica, California, the third child of homemaker Gertrude Temple and bank employee George Temple. The family was of Dutch, English, and German ancestry. She had two brothers: John and George, Jr. The family moved to Brentwood, Los Angeles.Temple's mother encouraged her to develop her singing, dancing, and acting talents. At about this time, her mother began styling Temple's hair in ringlets.While at the dance school, Temple was spotted by Charles Lamont, who was a casting director for Educational Pictures. She hid behind a piano while he was in the studio. Lamont liked Temple and invited her to audition. He signed her to a contract in 1932. Educational Pictures launched its Baby Burlesks, 10-minute comedy shorts satirizing recent films and events, using preschool children in every role. In 1933, Temple appeared in Glad Rags to Riches, a parody of the Mae West feature She Done Him Wrong, with Temple as a saloon singer. That same year, she appeared in Kid 'in' Africa as a child imperiled in the jungle and in Runt Page, a pastiche of the previous year's The Front Page. The younger players in the cast recited their lines phonetically.
Temple became the breakout star of this series, and Educational promoted her to 20-minute comedies in the Frolics of Youth series with Frank Coghlan Jr. Temple played Mary Lou Rogers, the baby sister in a contemporary suburban family. Temple and her child costars modeled for breakfast cereals and other products to fund production costs. She was lent to Tower Productions for a small role in the studio's first feature film, The Red-Haired Alibi (1932), and in 1933 to Universal, Paramount and Warner Bros. Pictures for various parts, including an uncredited role in To the Last Man (1933), starring Randolph Scott and Esther Ralston.


== Film career ==
After viewing one of Temple's Frolics of Youth films, Fox Film Corporation songwriter Jay Gorney saw her dancing in the theater lobby. Recognizing her from the screen, Gorney arranged a screen test for Temple for the film Stand Up and Cheer! (1934). Temple auditioned on December 7, 1933 and won the part. She was signed to a $150-per-week contract that was guaranteed for two weeks by Fox. The role was a breakthrough performance for Temple. Her charm was evident to Fox executives, and she was ushered into corporate offices almost immediately after finishing ""Baby, Take a Bow"", a song-and-dance number that she performed with James Dunn.


=== Roles ===
Biographer John Kasson argues:

In almost all of these films, she played the role of emotional healer, mending rifts between erstwhile sweethearts, estranged family members, traditional and modern ways, and warring armies. Characteristically lacking one or both parents, she constituted new families of those most worthy to love and protect her. Producers delighted in contrasting her diminutive stature, sparkling eyes, dimpled smile, and 56 blond curls by casting her opposite strapping leading men, such as Gary Cooper, John Boles, Victor McLaglen, and Randolph Scott. Yet her favorite costar was the great African American tap dancer Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson, with whom she appeared in four films, beginning with The Little Colonel (1935), in which they performed the famous staircase dance.
Biographer Anne Edwards wrote about the tone and tenor of Temple's films:

This was mid-Depression, and schemes proliferated for the care of the needy and the regeneration of the fallen. But they all required endless paperwork and demeaning, hours-long queues, at the end of which an exhausted, nettled social worker dealt with each person as a faceless number. Shirley offered a natural solution: to open one's heart.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt praised her performances, saying, ""It is a splendid thing that for just 15 cents, an American can go to a movie and look at the smiling face of a baby and forget his troubles.""


=== Finances ===
On December 21, 1933, Temple's contract was extended to one year at the same $150 per week (equivalent to $3,391 in 2022) with a seven-year option, and her mother Gertrude was hired at $25 per week as her hairdresser and personal coach. Released in May 1934, Stand Up and Cheer! became Shirley's breakthrough film. She performed in a short skit in the film alongside popular Fox star James Dunn, singing and tap dancing. Fox executives rushed her into another film with Dunn, Baby Take a Bow (named after their song in Stand Up and Cheer!). Temple's third film, also with Dunn, was Bright Eyes (1934), a vehicle written especially for her.After the success of her first three films, Temple's parents realized that she was not being paid sufficiently. Her image also began to appear on numerous commercial products without her legal authorization and without compensation. To regain control over the use of her image and to negotiate with Fox, Temple's parents hired lawyer Lloyd Wright to represent them. On July 18, 1934, Temple's contractual salary was raised to $1,000 per week, and her mother's salary was raised to $250 per week, with an additional $15,000 bonus for each finished film. Cease-and-desist letters were sent to many companies and the authorized corporate licenses began to be issued.Bright Eyes, written with her acting style in mind, was released in 1934 The film included the song ""On the Good Ship Lollipop"", which is considered to be her signature song. She was awarded a miniature Juvenile Oscar in 1935.


=== 1935–1937 ===
Temple's quota of films in each calendar year was increased from three to four in the contract that her parents signed in July 1934. Now and Forever starring Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard (with Temple billed third with her name above the title beneath Cooper's and Lombard's), The Little Colonel, Our Little Girl, Curly Top (with the signature song ""Animal Crackers in My Soup"") and The Littlest Rebel were released after the contract was signed. Curly Top was Temple's last film before the merger between 20th Century Pictures and the Fox Film Corporation.Temple's salary was $2,500 per week by the end of 1935. Elaborate sets were built for the production at the famed Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, where a rock feature at the heavily filmed location ranch was eventually named Shirley Temple Rock.Heidi was the only other Temple film released in 1937. Midway through shooting of the movie, the dream sequence was added to the script. Temple herself reportedly was behind the dream sequence and she had enthusiastically pushed for it, but in her autobiography, she vehemently denied this. Her contract gave neither her parents nor her any creative control over her movies. She saw this as Zanuck's refusal to make any serious attempt at building upon the success of her dramatic role in Wee Willie Winkie.One of the many examples of how Temple was permeating popular culture at the time is the references to her in the 1937 film Stand-In; newly minted film studio honcho Atterbury Dodd (played by Leslie Howard) has never heard of Temple, much to the shock and disbelief of former child star Lester Plum (played by Joan Blondell), who describes herself as ""the Shirley Temple of my day"", and performs ""On the Good Ship Lollipop"" for him.


=== 1938–1940 ===
The Independent Theatre Owners Association paid for an advertisement in The Hollywood Reporter in May 1938 that included Temple on a list of actors who deserved their salaries while others' (including Katharine Hepburn and Joan Crawford) ""box-office draw is nil"".In 1939, she was the subject of the Salvador Dalí painting Shirley Temple, The Youngest, Most Sacred Monster of the Cinema in Her Time, and she was animated with Donald Duck in The Autograph Hound.
In 1940, Lester Cowan, an independent film producer, bought the screen rights to F. Scott Fitzgerald's Babylon Revisited for $80. Fitzgerald thought his screenwriting days were over, and with some hesitation, accepted Cowan's offer to write the screenplay titled ""Cosmopolitan"" based on the short story. After finishing the screenplay, Fitzgerald was told by Cowan that he would not do the film unless Temple starred in the lead role of the youngster Honoria. Fitzgerald objected, saying that at age 12, the actress was too worldly for the part and would detract from the aura of innocence otherwise framed by Honoria's character. After meeting Temple in July, Fitzgerald changed his mind, and tried to persuade her mother to let her star in the film. However, her mother demurred. In any case, the Cowan project was shelved by the producer. Fitzgerald was later credited with the use of the original story for The Last Time I Saw Paris starring Elizabeth Taylor.


=== 1941–1950: Final films and retirement ===
Shirley signed with MGM after leaving 20th Century-Fox. However, upon meeting with Arthur Freed for a preliminary interview, the MGM producer exposed his genitals to her. When this elicited nervous giggles in response, Freed threw her out and ended their contract before any films were produced. The next idea was teaming her with Garland and Rooney for the musical Babes on Broadway. Fearing that either of the latter two could easily upstage Temple, MGM replaced her with Virginia Weidler. As a result, her only film for MGM was the relatively unsuccessful film Kathleen, released in 1941. Miss Annie Rooney followed for United Artists in 1942, but was unsuccessful. The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer starring Cary Grant and Fort Apache starring John Wayne and Henry Fonda were two of her few hit films in the 1940s. Her then-husband John Agar also appeared in Fort Apache. She and former US president Ronald Reagan were both in That Hagen Girl (1947). Both actors would go onto careers in politics or diplomacy. She did not formally announce her retirement from full-length films until 1950.


== Radio career ==
Temple briefly had her own radio series on CBS. Junior Miss debuted March 4, 1942, in which she played the title role. The series was based on stories by Sally Benson. Sponsored by Procter & Gamble, Junior Miss was directed by Gordon Hughes, with David Rose as musical director. The series ended on August 26, 1942. 


== Merchandise and endorsements ==
John Kasson states:

She was also the most popular celebrity to endorse merchandise for children and adults, rivaled only by Mickey Mouse. She transformed children's fashions, popularizing a toddler look for girls up to the age of 12, and by the mid-1930s, Ideal Novelty and Toy Company's line of Shirley Temple dolls accounted for almost a third of all dolls sold in the country.
Successful Shirley Temple items included a line of girls' dresses and many other items.Alongside licensed merchandise came counterfeit items bearing Temple's likeness to capitalize on her fame, from dolls, clothing, and other accessories to even cigars with her face printed on the label. Temple lamented in her memoirs that it ""made no economic sense"" to pursue litigation against those who made unlicensed goods under her name; a successful lawsuit was filed by Ideal Toy Company against a certain Lenora Doll Company, which manufactured and sold Shirley Temple dolls without authorization, with Temple herself cited as a co-plaintiff befitting her celebrity status.


== Myths and rumors ==
At the height of her popularity, Temple was the subject of many myths and rumors, with several being propagated by the Fox press department. Fox publicized her as a natural talent with no formal acting or dance training. As a way of explaining how she knew stylized buck-and-wing dancing, she was enrolled for two weeks in the Elisa Ryan School of Dancing.False claims circulated that Temple was not a child, but a 30-year-old dwarf, due in part to her stocky body type. The rumor was so prevalent, especially in Europe, that the Vatican dispatched Father Silvio Massante to investigate whether she was indeed a child. The fact that she never seemed to miss any teeth led some people to conclude that she had all her adult teeth. Temple was actually losing her primary teeth regularly through her days with Fox, for example during the sidewalk ceremony in front of Grauman's Theatre, where she took off her shoes and placed her bare feet in the concrete, taking attention away from her face. When acting, she wore dental plates and caps to hide the gaps in her teeth. Another rumor said her teeth had been filed to make them appear like baby teeth.A rumor about Temple's trademark hair was that she wore a wig. On multiple occasions, fans yanked her hair to test the rumor. She later said she wished all she had to do was wear a wig. The nightly process she endured in the setting of her curls was tedious and grueling, with weekly vinegar rinses that stung her eyes.Rumors spread that her hair color was not naturally blonde. During the making of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, news spread that she was going to do extended scenes without her trademark curls. During production, she also caught a cold, which caused her to miss a couple of days. As a result, a false report originated in Britain that all of her hair had been cut off.


== Television career ==
In 1999, she hosted the AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars awards show on CBS, and in 2001 served as a consultant on an ABC-TV production of her autobiography, Child Star: The Shirley Temple Story.


== Diplomatic career ==
Temple became active in the California Republican Party. In 1967, she ran unsuccessfully in a special election in California's 11th congressional district after eight-term Republican J. Arthur Younger died of leukemia. She ran in the open primary as a conservative Republican and came in second with 34,521 votes (22.44%), behind Republican law school professor Pete McCloskey, who placed first in the primary with 52,882 votes (34.37%) and advanced to the general election with Democrat Roy A. Archibald, who finished fourth with 15,069 votes (9.79%), but advanced as the highest-placed Democratic candidate. In the general election, McCloskey was elected with 63,850 votes (57.2%) to Archibald's 43,759 votes (39.2%). Temple received 3,938 votes (3.53%) as an independent write-in.
Temple was extensively involved with the Commonwealth Club of California, a public-affairs forum headquartered in San Francisco. She spoke at many meetings throughout the years, and was president for a period in 1984.Temple got her start in foreign service after her failed run for Congress in 1967, when Henry Kissinger overheard her talking about South West Africa at a party. He was surprised that she knew anything about it. She was appointed as a delegate to the 24th United Nations General Assembly (September – December 1969) by President Richard M. Nixon and United States Ambassador to Ghana (December 6, 1974 – July 13, 1976) by President Gerald R. Ford. She was appointed first female Chief of Protocol of the United States (July 1, 1976 – January 21, 1977).She served as the United States Ambassador to Czechoslovakia (August 23, 1989 – July 12, 1992), having been appointed by President George H. W. Bush, and was the first and only woman in this job. Temple bore witness to two crucial moments in the history of Czechoslovakia's fight against communism. She was in Prague in August 1968, as a representative of the International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies, and was going to meet with Czechoslovakian party leader Alexander Dubček on the very day that Soviet-backed forces invaded the country. Dubček fell out of favor with the Soviets after a series of reforms, known as the Prague Spring. Temple, who was stranded at a hotel as the tanks rolled in, sought refuge on the roof of the hotel. She later reported that it was from there she saw an unarmed woman on the street gunned down by Soviet forces, the sight of which stayed with her for the rest of her life.Later, after she became ambassador to Czechoslovakia, she was present during the Velvet Revolution, which brought about the end of communism in Czechoslovakia. Temple openly sympathized with anti-communist dissidents and was ambassador when the United States established formal diplomatic relations with the newly elected government led by Václav Havel. She took the unusual step of personally accompanying Havel on his first official visit to Washington, travelling on the same plane.


== Personal life ==
In 1943, 15-year-old Temple met 22-year-old John Agar, whom she married two years later in 1945, at age 17. She gave birth to Linda Susan Agar in 1948. Agar was reportedly an alcoholic, and had extramarital affairs. Temple divorced Agar in 1950 on the grounds of mental cruelty.Temple was married to Charles Alden Black from 1950 until his death on August 4, 2005. Their daughter Lori became a bassist for the rock band the Melvins.


=== Breast cancer ===
At age 44, in 1972, Temple was diagnosed with breast cancer. At the time, cancer was typically discussed in hushed whispers, and Temple's public disclosure was a significant milestone in improving breast cancer awareness and reducing stigma around the disease.


== Death ==
Temple died at age 85 on February 10, 2014, at her home in Woodside, California. The cause of death, according to her death certificate released on March 3, 2014, was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Temple was a lifelong cigarette smoker but avoided displaying her habit in public because she did not want to set a bad example for her fans. She is buried at Alta Mesa Memorial Park.


== Awards, honors, and legacy ==
On March 14, 1935, Shirley left her footprints and handprints in the wet cement at the forecourt of Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. She was the Grand Marshal of the New Year's Day Rose Parade in Pasadena, California, three times in 1939, 1989, and 1999. On February 8, 1960, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
In 1970, she received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In February 1980, Temple was honored by the Freedoms Foundation of Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. In 1975, Temple was installed as an honorary deputy paramount chief of the Oguaa people of Ghana.Her name is further immortalized by the mocktail named after her, although Temple found the drink far too sweet for her palate. In 1988, Temple brought a lawsuit to prevent a bottled soda version from using her name.On June 9, 2021, Temple was featured on that day's Google Doodle in celebration of the opening anniversary of ""Love, Shirley Temple” a special exhibit featuring a collection of her rare memorabilia at Santa Monica History Museum.

SS Etruria,"SS Etruria was a steel hulled lake freighter that served on the Great Lakes of North America from her construction in 1902 to her sinking in 1905. On June 18, 1905, while sailing upbound on Lake Huron with a cargo of coal, she was rammed and sunk by the freighter Amasa Stone 10 miles (16 km) off Presque Isle Light. For nearly 106 years the location of Etruria's wreck remained unknown, until the spring of 2011 when her wreck was found upside down in 310 feet (94 m) of water.


== History ==


=== Design and construction ===
Etruria was named after the famous Cunard Line ocean liner, RMS Etruria. Etruria was built by the West Bay City Shipbuilding Company in West Bay City, Michigan for the Hawgood Transit Company of Cleveland, Ohio. She had an overall length of 434 feet (132 m), and a between perpendiculars length of 414 feet (126 m). Her beam was 50 feet (15 m) wide, and in her original enrollment, her depth was listed as 24 feet (7.3 m); also, in her original enrollment, her gross register tonnage was listed at 4744 tons and her net register tonnage was listed at 4439 tons. She was powered by a 1500-horsepower triple expansion steam engine, which was fueled by two Scotch marine boilers. She had a cargo capacity of 7000 tons. She was also built with a single deck, and twelve cargo hatches.Etruria was the first of four identical sister ships built for the Hawgood Transit Company. Her sisters were (in order of construction), Bransford, J.M. Jenks and H.B. Hawgood.


=== Service history ===
Etruria was launched on February 8, 1902 as hull number #604. She was enrolled for the first time on April 12, 1905 in Port Huron, Michigan, and was given the official number #136977. On April 15, 1902 Etruria was re-enrolled in Cleveland, Ohio. On March 25, 1903 an error in Etruria's enrollment was corrected; her depth was corrected from 24 feet (7.3 m) to 28 feet (8.5 m); and her gross tonnage was corrected from 4744 tons to 4653 tons, and her net tonnage was corrected from 4439 tons to 3415 tons.


=== Final voyage ===
On June 18, 1905 while upbound with a cargo of coal from Toledo, Ohio, heading to Superior, Wisconsin, Etruria was rammed by the larger steel freighter Amasa Stone on her starboard side, abreast of her No.9 hatch. After just five minutes, Etruria rolled over and sank about 10 miles (16 km) off Presque Isle Light; her entire crew was rescued by the steamer Maritana.At the time of her sinking, Etruria was the largest freighter ever to have sunk on the Great Lakes.Etruria's enrollment surrendered on June 30, 1905.


=== Aftermath ===
Shortly after Etruria's sinking, the Hawgood Transit Company and the Mesaba Steamship Company (owners of Amasa Stone) filed several lawsuits against each other for the damage done to their respective vessels. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit rendered a final judgement on June 15, 1908. A brief by the Hawgood Transit Company stated that:

The steamer Etruria was laden with 7,000 net tons of coal loaded on Lake Erie and destined for Lake Michigan ports. At all times the Etruria was properly crewed and fully manned. About 01:00 hours on June 18, 1905, the hazy night turned to rain and fog set in, and the Etruria proceeded at a moderate pace, sounding her fog signal regularly. About 03:35 hours that morning on a proper course headed for the Straits of Mackinac, the Etruria heard the fog signals of a steamer, which proved to be the Amasa Stone. It sounded a long distance from the Etruria and was distinctly to her starboard. At this point, the Etruria blew a two-blast signal but the Stone didn’t reply with the same passing signal, and the Etruria slowed to bare steerage, stopped her engine completely and shortly thereafter, without warning or signal, the Stone came out of the fog at full speed. The Stone struck the Etruria a heavy blow on her starboard side abreast hatch No.9, breaking in her side. The Etruria began to list and sank at once, meanwhile blowing distress signals. The Etruria launched its lifeboats just in time to see the steamer roll over. As it turned upside down, the hatches gave way, and the coal cargo spilled out before the sinking ship. The Amasa Stone then departed the scene without rendering assistance. The steamer Maritana was upbound in the vicinity and picked up the crew, landing them at Detour and at the Sault.
The lawsuit stated that Etruria had a value of $265,000, her cargo had a value of $13,460.70 and the crew's effects had a value of $3,029.11; in total, Etruria was a  $281,489.81 loss. The suit further stated that the collision was ""due solely to the negligence and want of care on the part of Amasa Stone and those in charge of navigation"". Amasa Stone was found to be guilty of the following actions:
Not maintaining an efficient lookout
Not answering passing signals
Running at excessive speed
Failing to stop and reverse
Failing to stand byLawyers for the Mesaba Steamship Company concluded that Etruria was not travelling at a slow speed, but at a fast one and that her navigational officers were guilty of inattention. They also concluded that Amasa Stone did not leave the scene following the collision, but that she turned round, and tried to offer assistance, but Etruria's crew took to the lifeboats, and rowed off in the opposite direction. When both sides made their argument, Judge Henry Harrison Swan ruled in Detroit, Michigan that both vessels were equally at fault, and that insurance proceeds were the only means of recouping each vessel's loss.


== Etruria wreck ==


=== Discovery ===
In 2011 a group consisting of expert shipwreck hunters and high school students from Saginaw, Michigan tried to locate the long sought-after semi-whaleback steamer Choctaw. Their search effort was made into a documentary named ""Project Shiphunt"", which was sponsored by Sony and Intel. On May 17, 2011 they discovered two shipwrecks, Etruria and the schooner M.F. Merrick which sank in 1889 after a collision with the steamer R.P. Ranney.


=== Etruria today ===
The remains of Etruria rest in 310 feet (94 m) of cold fresh water. The wreck is upside down, with 405 feet (123 m) of her hull exposed, with a portion of her stern being buried. Her bow is raised above the sediment by several feet allowing access to her intact pilot house and forward deck house area and first cargo hatch. Her forward ladder is in place running to the port side bridge wing, which is buried in sediment. Her two stockless anchors are still intact at her bow. Discovery of the wrecks was made public on July 13, 2011. Her wreck is part of the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary.


=== National Register of Historic Places nomination ===
On September 19, 2014 the wreck of Etruria was nominated for a listing on the National Register of Historic Places, for her state level significance. Her listing was denied; had she been listed, she would have been given the reference number #14001009.

Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 216,"Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 216 (P. Oxy. 216 or P. Oxy. II 216) is a rhetorical exercise by an unknown author, written in Greek. It was discovered in Oxyrhynchus. The manuscript was written on papyrus in the form of a roll. It is dated to the first century BC or first century AD. Currently it is housed in the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library (35) of the Yale University.


== Description ==
The document was written by an unknown copyist. The measurements of the fragment are 175 by 194 mm. The text is written in a large uncial hand. It is paleographically important because it can be dated relatively accurately.  It was found with a number of documents dated to the time of Tiberius and Claudius.  The verso side of the document contains a late first century letter which is mostly obscured by another document, glued to the scroll to strengthen it.It was discovered by Grenfell and Hunt in 1897 in Oxyrhynchus.

Bobo people,"The Bobo are a Mande ethnic group living primarily in Burkina Faso, with some living north in Mali. Bobo is also a shortened name of the second-largest city in Burkina Faso, Bobo-Dioulasso.


== Background ==
In much of the literature on African art, the group that lives in the area of Bobo-Dioulasso is called Bobo-Fing, literally ""black Bobo"". These people call themselves Bobo and speak the Bobo language, a Mande language. The Bambara people also call another ethnic group ""Bobo"", the Bobo-Oule/Wule, more precisely called the Bwa. While the Bwa (Bobo-Oule) are a Gur people, speaking Gur languages (the Bwa languages), the true Bobo (Bobo Madare, Bobo Fing) are a Mande people.


== Demographics ==
The Bobo number about 110,000 people, with the great majority in Burkina Faso. The major Bobo community in the south is Bobo-Dioulasso, the second-largest city of Burkina Faso and the old French colonial capital. Further north are large towns, including Fô and Kouka, with Boura in the extreme north in Mali.
The Bobo are far from homogeneous. They are an ancient aggregation of several peoples who have assembled around a number of core clans that do not preserve any oral traditions of immigration into the area. Their language and culture are more closely related to those of their Mandé neighbours to the north and west, the Bamana (as well as the Minianka, also known as Mamara Senoufo, and a Gur people) than to their Voltaic neighbours the Gurunsi and Mossi, but they should be thought of as a southern extension of the Mandé people who live in what is now Burkina Faso, rather than an intrusive Mandé group that has recently penetrated the region. Although over 41% of Bobo lineages claim a foreign origin, they also say that they are autochthonous.


== Economy ==
Farming among the Bobo is of primary importance. Agricultural activity is not merely a way of providing for subsistence among the Bobo, it is the essential component of their day-to-day existence. The major food crops are red sorghum, pearl millet, yams, and maize. They also cultivate cotton, which is sold to textile mills in Koudougou. The imposition of colonial rule and the construction of these mills led to the disintegration of the local co-operative labor systems, which had served to bond the members of Bobo society together.


== Political system ==
The Bobo lineage is the fundamental social building-block. The Bobo are an inherently decentralized group of people. The concept of placing political power in the hands of an individual is foreign to the Bobo. Each village is organized according to the relationship among individual patriline. The lineage unites all descendants of a common ancestor, called the wakoma, a word whose stem, wa-, is a contraction of the Bobo word for house wasa. The Bobo lineage comprises the people who live in a common house. The head of a lineage is called the wakoma or father of the lineage. He may also be called the sapro, which is the term for ancestors. As among other peoples in Burkina, each clan has a totem, so that when a Bobo introduces himself he gives his given name, then his clan name, followed by the totem that he respects.


== Religion ==
The creator god is called Wuro. He cannot be described and is not represented by sculptures. Bobo cosmogony describes the creation of the world by Wuro and the ordering of his creations. He is responsible for the ordering of all things in the world into opposing pairs: man/spirits, male/female, village/bush, culture/nature and so on.
The balances between forces as they were created by Wuro are precarious, and it is easy for men to throw the forces out of balance. Farming, for instance, can unbalance the precarious equilibrium between culture/nature and village/bush when the crops are gathered in the bush and brought into the village.
For the Bobo people there are two important epochs. The time of Wuro, when the universe was created and the historical time, when Wuro gave man his son Dwo.

Vardy Community School,"The Vardy Community School was a Presbyterian mission school established in the Vardy community of Hancock County, Tennessee, United States, in the late-19th and early-20th centuries.  At the time of its founding, the school was the only institution providing primary education to children of the multi-racial Melungeon communities, who lived in the remote mountainous areas along the Tennessee-Virginia border.
Part of a segregated system, it was restricted to children considered black or multiracial. Presbyterian missionaries operated the school until 1955; following the United States Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) ruling that segregated schools were unconstitutional, it became part of the Hancock County public school system.  In 1984, the school and the structures associated with the mission community that developed around it were designated as a historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Vardy Community School Historic District.During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, dozens of settlement schools and mission schools were established across rural Appalachia. In 1892 the Presbyterian Church decided to build such a school at Vardy, a community located near the heart of Melungeon country in the Blackwater Creek Valley.  Over the next forty-five years, the mission school complex expanded to include a three-story frame schoolhouse, a church, a manse, a library, and several residences for teachers and children.  Although the schoolhouse has collapsed, the school's alumni and other historical groups have preserved its ruins and related structures as a historic site.  In 2000, the 19th-century log cabin belonging to Melungeon moonshiner Mahala Mullins was relocated to a site across the street from the Vardy School district.


== Location ==
The Vardy community, sometimes called ""Vardy Valley,"" is situated in a narrow valley carved by Blackwater Creek between Newman's Ridge on the south and Powell Mountain on the north.  The valley, part of the Clinch River watershed, stretches for roughly 10 miles (16 km) from Mulberry Gap southwest of Vardy to the Blackwater community in Lee County, Virginia to the northeast. Vardy is still relatively isolated, its primary access being from Sneedville via State Highway 63, which crosses Newman's Ridge through a series of steep switchbacks before intersecting Vardy Blackwater Road near Mulberry Gap.  The Vardy School Community is located along Vardy Blackwater Road about 5 miles (8.0 km) east of the road's junction with TN-63.


== History ==
In the early 19th century, the early Melungeon settler Vardeman ""Vardy"" Collins (1764–?) received a grant for a large plot of land in the Newman's Ridge area. It included the land on which the Vardy school and church are now located.  In subsequent decades, his descendants developed his namesake community along Blackwater Creek.  In 1834, the Tennessee Constitutional Convention restricted the rights of free people of color, including Melungeons, depriving them of the right to vote, which they had had since the state was established in 1796. They were also forbidden attending public schools, of which there were few in rural areas. This disfranchisement was similar to restrictions passed in Virginia and other southern states following the 1831 Nat Turner slave rebellion. Such racial discrimination contributed to the Melungeons of Newman's Ridge maintaining a closed, endogamous community.
Presbyterians were active in Vardy by the late 19th century, when itinerant Presbyterian ministers Christopher Humble and H. P. Cory were conducting sporadic services in the Blackwater Valley.  In 1892, the Presbyterian Church's Holston Presbytery decided to establish a mission school at Vardy, and the Presbyterian Women's Board of Missions appointed Annie Miller and Maggie Axtell as missionaries to the community.  Batey Collins (a grandson of Vardeman) and his wife Cynthia donated several acres of land for the mission school and church, and other locals donated lumber and helped with construction. The Vardy Mission School, which initially held classes in a crude log structure (no longer standing), was the first to offer the state-mandated 1st-grade through 8th-grade curriculum to children living in the valley.  The Vardy Presbyterian Church was completed in 1899, and a new frame schoolhouse was completed in 1902.

In 1910, Mary Rankin, a Scottish missionary and Columbia graduate, arrived in Vardy. For more than three decades, she served as a teacher and nurse.  Rankin taught prenatal and postnatal childcare to local mothers and fought malnutrition in the valley.  Between 1920 and 1952, the Vardy mission thrived under the leadership of Chester F. Leonard and his wife, Josephine.  A new three-story schoolhouse, powered by a Delco generator, was completed in 1929.  Upon completion of the new schoolhouse, the Vardy Mission School became known as the Vardy Community School. A series of interim ministers succeeded Leonard.
Following the United States Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), ruling that segregated schools were unconstitutional, the Presbyterian Church sold the Vardy school to Hancock County in 1955 and it became part of the public school system.  Classes continued at the school until 1973, and services continued at the Vardy Presbyterian Church until 1980.By 1984, when the Vardy school, church, and ancillary structures were added to the National Register of Historic Places, Vardy had just eight residents.  With a $10,000 grant from the Tennessee Humanities Council, the Vardy Community Historical Society began restoring the Vardy Community School's surviving structures.  In 2000, the group restored the Mahala Mullins Cabin and moved it from atop Newman's Ridge to Vardy Blackwater Road, opposite the church.


== Historic structures ==


=== Vardy School Community Historic District ===
The Vardy School Community Historic District consists of eight contributing structures and several ancillary structures.  The structures all have vernacular designs, although the school and some residences have bungalow influences, and the church's bell tower has Gothic influences.  Contributing structures include:

Vardy Community School, a three-story structure built in 1929 and designed by William H. Leonard (father of Chester F. Leonard). The building originally consisted of a frame structure with a gambrel cross-gable roof and corrugated metal siding.  The building's 96 windows allowed ample sunlight to enter during cooler months and allowed cross-breezes to cool classrooms during the warmer months.  The building collapsed in October 2003, and only the first-story south wall and part of the first-story floor remain intact.  The school has five ancillary structures: a frame garage, a limestone storehouse, a limestone bath house, a limestone water storage tank, and a frame teacher's cottage.
Vardy Presbyterian Church, a one-story structure built in 1899 by Morgan Osborne and Miles Watson of nearby Blackwater, Virginia.  The church has white frame walls, a pitched tin roof, and a two-story side-gabled roof bell tower.  The entrance to the church is via double-leaf door at the base of the bell tower.  The church has pointed arch windows on its sides and a tripartite pointed-arch tracery window on its front facade.  Heavy swinging double-doors divide the vestibule and sanctuary.The Chester F. Leonard Manse, a one-story frame structure built in 1921.  This building is a prefabricated structure ordered from an Iowa company, and consists of weatherboard siding and a side-gable roof.
The Clinic, a one-story structure consisting of two rooms with an exterior door for each room on the west side, built over a rock cellar circa 1923. Located behind the manse, it has corrugated metal siding with four windows spanning the front wall and two windows on the back side.
The general store, a one-story frame structure built in 1937.
The second Vardy Mission School, a 1+1⁄2-story frame structure built in 1902.  This building has clapboard siding, a pitched gable roof, and a covered porch.  The building replaced a crude log structure that had served as the mission's ""first"" schoolhouse for nearly a decade.  After the completion of the Vardy Community School in 1929, this structure was converted into a residence.
A 1+1⁄2-story house built in 1920.  The house is a frame structure with side-gabled roof and a covered front porch.
A one-story house built in 1934.  The house is a frame structure with a gable roof and covered porch.  The house has two contributing ancillary structures— a two-door limestone-wall garage and a small frame storage shed.


=== Mahala Mullins Cabin ===
The Mahala Mullins Cabin was the residence of Mahala Mullins (1824–1898), a legendary Melungeon moonshiner.  Afflicted with elephantiasis, Mullins was extremely heavy, which led to local exaggerations about her size. Revenue agents were aware of Mullins' moonshining activities, and often destroyed her stills, but due to her size, they were unable to arrest her.The cabin is a two-story ""dogtrot"" cabin constructed of hewn poplar logs with dovetail notching.  Massive chimneys of native stone were built at both ends of the cabin.  The dogtrot was filled in to make extra room in the 1920s, but has been restored to its original state.  The cabin was originally located on the slopes of Newman's Ridge on the property of Dan and Chris Williams.  The Williamses donated the cabin to the Vardy Community Historical Society, and the cabin was relocated and restored in 2000.

Anti-siphoning law,"Anti-siphoning laws and regulations are designed to prevent pay television broadcasters from buying monopoly rights to televise important and culturally significant events before free-to-air television has a chance to bid on them.  The theory is that if such a monopoly was allowed, then those unable or unwilling to obtain access to the pay television service would be unable to view the important and culturally significant events. Generally the laws allow pay-TV to bid for such monopoly rights only if free-to-air television has declined to bid on them.
Notable examples of such policies are present in Australia and the United Kingdom. Anti-siphoning in the United States was introduced by the FCC in 1975 and was soon overturned as unconstitutional. Some sports leagues do contractually obligate that their broadcasters include a certain number of telecasts on over-the-air television as part of their overall contracts. For games broadcast exclusively by pay television channels, the National Football League similarly requires syndicated, over-the-air simulcasts in the markets of the teams involved, to ensure that all of a team's games are available locally on broadcast television.


== Australia ==

Anti-siphoning laws in Australia cover specific listed events, such as all Olympic Games and the Commonwealth Games, the FIFA World Cup, Rugby World Cup, and Rugby League World Cup finals, events in major sports (such as association football, cricket, and rugby tests) that involve Australian senior national teams or are hosted by Australia, and culturally-significant events such as the Australian Football League and National Rugby League premierships, the State of Origin series, all games in the Australian Open, the Melbourne Cup horse race, the Bathurst 1000, the Australian Grand Prix, and the Australian Motorcycle Grand Prix among others.


== India ==
Indian law requires all sporting events of ""national importance"", whose broadcast rights are owned by a pay television service, to be simulcast by the state broadcaster Doordarshan (DD) on its DD National TV channel. Tata Sky (which, at the time of the lawsuit, was partly owned by 21st Century Fox, the parent company of Star India which owns the Star Sports networks) filed a lawsuit over the rule, arguing that these simulcasts devalued its exclusive rights to these events because DD National is a must-carry channel. In 2017, the Supreme Court of India ruled that pay television services must black out DD National when it is airing such events in order to protect the pay TV broadcaster, restricting availability of DD's simulcasts of such events to terrestrial television and DD Free Dish.


== Ireland ==
Section 162 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 entitles the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to designate sporting or other major events as events of major importance to society. The effect of such a designation is that the event must be available on a ""qualifying broadcaster"", which currently comprises RTÉ, Virgin Media TV, or TG4. A holder of exclusive rights which is not a qualifying broadcaster is obliged to sell such rights to a qualifying broadcaster or refrain from broadcasting the event itself. As of 2017, the list of designated events is:
The Summer Olympics
The all-Ireland senior football and hurling finals
Ireland's matches in the FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Football Championship, and their respective qualifying tournaments; as well as the opening matches, the semi-finals, and the finals of those tournaments
Ireland's matches in the Rugby World Cup
The Irish Grand National and Irish Derby in horse racing
The FEI Nations Cup at the Dublin Horse Show
Ireland's matches in the Six Nations Championship (designated for deferred coverage, although in practice shown live)


== Thailand ==
In November 2012, the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) approved draft ""must-have"" regulations, requiring designated events to be carried by free-to-air channels:
Olympic Games
Paralympic Games
Asian Games
Asian Para Games
Southeast Asian Games
ASEAN Para Games
FIFA World Cup Final


== United Kingdom ==

The Ofcom Code on Sports and Other Listed and Designated Events regulates that coverage of certain major sporting events (known as ""Category A"" events, covering certain major domestic events and major international competitions such as the Olympics and FIFA World Cup) must be broadcast primarily on a free-to-air channel (but can share coverage with pay channels), while certain events known as ""Category B"" events can be shown on pay channels, but supplemental coverage (such as highlights or a delayed broadcast) must be provided by a free-to-air channel.


== United States ==
In the early days of cable television the Federal Communications Commission refused to regulate it. In 1958 the FCC ruled that cable TV was not a common carrier and thus is not subject to FCC jurisdiction. In 1960 the FCC lobbied against placing cable TV under its jurisdiction, arguing that the administrative burden is inadequate to low perceived threats of unchecked cable development. In 1965 the FCC changed its stance and imposed must-carry rules, requiring cable providers to carry local free-to-air channels, and banned importation of distant channels that duplicated content available on local free-to-air channels.
In the early 1960s, the Federal Communications Commission implemented ""the anti-siphoning rules"" pertaining to the availability of theatrical motion pictures for broadcast pay TV.  The first trial of the technical and commercial feasibility of this business was in Hartford, Connecticut. The three major broadcast networks and National Association of Theatre Owners convinced the FCC to implement regulations that provided theatrical motion pictures would only be made available for exhibition on pay-TV prior to two years after the initial theatrical release and after 10 years from the initial theatrical release date
This restriction had the effect of banning movies from being distributed via pay TV during an 8 year period.  Inasmuch as movies typically derived nearly 100% of their revenues during an 18 month period from initial theatrical release, the availability of such movies were limited to a six month prior to the second anniversary of their initial theatrical release date.
In the end of the 1960s the public and the government raised concerns that cable operators can outbid free-to-air channels and ""siphon"" popular content, first of all sports, off the free air. Specific events like the Super Bowl were deemed particularly vulnerable due to greater inelasticity of demand.In 1975 the FCC imposed anti-siphoning regulations that limited the operations of sports and film channels. Under the regulations, cable channels could not devote more than 90% of their time to film and sports, and could not broadcast films less than three years old. Specific (i.e. annual) sporting events could not be ""siphoned off"" by cable at all if they had been broadcast on free airwaves during any of the previous five years. Cable coverage of regular season games in popular championships was limited so that only a fraction of all games could be shown on cable. Should sports coverage on free-to-air channels decrease, stipulated the FCC, cable operators had to decrease their sports programming proportionately. Administrative record, however, did not support FCC allegations of ""siphoning"".The Department of Justice and a number of cable providers contested the FCC ruling in courts as unconstitutional. In 1977 the DC Circuit Court consolidated these cases in Home Box Office vs. FCC and found that the FCC trespassed over the rights guaranteed by the First Amendment. The court ruled that cable bandwidth, unlike broadcast spectra, is not a scarce resource, thus it is not subject to limitations allowed by the Red Lion vs. FCC ruling. The court applied the O'Brien test (the FCC failed two of its four ""prongs"") and found that the degree of limitation of free speech imposed by the FCC was inadequate, ""grossly overboard"" and thus ""arbitrary, capricious and unconstitutional"".In recent years, a growing number of major domestic and international sporting events previously aired by free-to-air channels have migrated to pay-TV outlets. Since 2007, excluding the World Series, Major League Baseball's postseason playoffs have largely moved to cable, while ESPN airs the majority of bowl games of college football (including the College Football Playoff and National Championship, and those owned and operated by its subsidiary ESPN Events). Three of tennis' Grand Slams are aired exclusively by ESPN (the French Open is held by Tennis Channel and NBC), and the majority of regional broadcasts in major leagues are now shown primarily by regional sports networks (with relatively few or no games broadcast on local free-to-air TV unless it is either nationally televised or only aired over-the-air due to RSN rights conflicts). In 2021, a new television deal between the National Hockey League and Turner Sports will place three of the next seven Stanley Cup Finals exclusively on TNT during odd-numbered years (the others aired in even-numbered years will be aired by ABC). In 2023, Major League Soccer shifted to a streaming-oriented broadcasting model, with all matches streaming on the Apple TV app and MLS Season Pass subscription, leaving a limited linear television package for Fox Sports.Ratings for the College Football Playoff, the NASCAR Cup Series championship, tennis majors, and PGA's Open Championship have suffered from the siphoning to ESPN.  NASCAR's 2015-24 television contract with Comcast's NBCUniversal for NBC and their cable network USA Network during the second half of the season required the broadcast of the championship race to be on NBC, where in previous years it solely aired on ESPN.  Likewise, golf's The Open Championship returned to network television in 2016, with weekend coverage on NBC and early round coverage on Golf Channel. Both the Premier League and The Open are unique in that network television coverage is available in the United States, while coverage in their home country (barring highlights) is limited to pay television (which also includes the Comcast-owned pay TV provider Sky).


=== National Football League ===

The National Football League implements an anti-siphoning policy as part of its television contracts. The majority of Sunday games are broadcast on over-the-air television by either CBS or Fox in order to reach the largest audience possible, although the games broadcast during the main afternoon windows are determined by the viewer's region, and viewers must purchase the out-of-market sports package NFL Sunday Ticket (which is carried exclusively by YouTube TV) in order to view games that are not shown in their region. Certain flagship games are also broadcast nationally on network television, including NBC's weekly Sunday Night Football, as well as the three annual Thanksgiving Day games, and the entirety of the post-season.
ESPN's Monday Night Football, Amazon Prime Video's Thursday Night Football, as well as selected games exclusively aired by NFL Network, ESPN+, or Peacock, are only televised nationally on pay television or subscription-based streaming . In these cases, NFL rules require simulcasts of the games to be syndicated to television stations within the home markets of the teams that are participating.  This ensures that the games are still available on broadcast TV in the local markets, whilst maintaining cable exclusivity for the games outside of the market. Beginning in 2014, ESPN has also held rights to a post-season wild card game; in the first year of this arrangement, the game was only simulcast in the markets of the teams involved, as with its other games. However, in 2015, ESPN began to simulcast the game on ABC (which returned the NFL to the network for the first time since Super Bowl XL) instead. ESPN later gained the right to simulcast selected regular season Monday Night Football games on ABC beginning in 2020, as well as air doubleheaders with simultaneous games split between the two channels.The Thursday Night Football package previously aired exclusively on NFL Network. The package generated a major controversy in December 2007, due to a Saturday-night game in the package between the New England Patriots and New York Giants, where the Patriots were vying to become the first team since 1972 to have completed the regular season with a perfect record. At the time, NFL Network was not carried by all major television providers (Comcast and Time Warner Cable insisted that they be able to carry NFL Network on a sports tier), and concerns were expressed by critics, such as then Senator John Kerry, that the ""historic"" game would not be available to the majority of viewers outside of the teams' markets (where the game was to air on WWOR-TV, WCVB-TV, and WMUR-TV) if it were not nationally televised on broadcast television. The NFL compromised by allowing CBS and NBC to simulcast the game, in addition to the three team market stations and NFL Network; commissioner Roger Goodell stated that the decision was ""in the best interest of our fans."" The arrangement did generate some controversy among broadcasters; WWOR owner Fox Television Stations and WCVB/WMUR owner Hearst-Argyle Television argued that the simulcast devalued what would have been their exclusive local rights.In 2014, as part of an overall effort to increase the prominence of the Thursday games, several of the games began to be broadcast and co-produced by CBS, in simulcast with NFL Network. In the 2016 and 2017 seasons, this block of games began to be split between CBS and NBC, but moved to Fox in 2018. In the 2022 season, Prime Video assumed exclusive rights to Thursday Night Football; the games can be streamed on Amazon-owned live streaming platform Twitch, and are syndicated to home market stations as per NFL rules for pay television broadcasters.

I'll Tell Me Ma,"""I'll Tell Me Ma"" (also called ""The Wind"") is a traditional children's song. It was collected in various parts of the United Kingdom in the 19th century and again appears in collections from shortly after the turn of the 20th century. In Ireland, especially within Ulster, the chorus usually refers to Belfast city and is known colloquially as ""The Belle of Belfast City"", although it is also adapted to other Irish cities, such as Dublin. Other versions refer to the ""Golden City"" or ""London City"".
This song is Roud Folk Song Index number 2649.
The song accompanies a children's game. A ring is formed by the children joining hands, one player standing in the centre. When asked, ""Please tell me who they be,"" the girl in the middle gives the name or initials of a boy in the ring (or vice versa). The ring then sings the rest of the words, and the boy who was named goes into the centre.

The Darcys,"The Darcys are a Canadian two-piece art rock band from Toronto, Ontario.
Currently independent, the duo was previously signed to a four-album deal with the record label Arts & Crafts. The third of those, 2013's Warring, was nominated for a Juno Award for Alternative Album of the Year, and was a longlist nominee for the 2014 Polaris Music Prize.


== Career ==


=== 2007-2011: Formation and early work ===
The Darcys, who obtained their name from Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, first began as the two-piece project of Jason Couse and Wes Marskell in Etobicoke, Ontario which gradually transitioned into a full band in Halifax, Nova Scotia with the additions of Dave Hurlow and Kirby Best. In December 2007, The Darcys’ debut album, Endless Water, was released. In the years following, the group returned to Toronto, and Michael le Riche was added to the lineup.Days before their 2010 CMW showcase, Best had left the band, forcing them to frantically re-create the work of five into parts for four. This brought about the solidification of the current four-piece lineup: Jason Couse, Wes Marskell, Michael le Riche, and Dave Hurlow. On losing Best and adding Couse on vocals, Marskell notes, ""We became really close friends because of it, and it also made us willing and able to work through things that came up later down the line that became publicized and were difficult for us internally."" In the process of touring and recording their 2011 follow-up album amidst lineup changes, The Darcys continued to encounter hardships. This included stolen equipment, being held at knifepoint, and nearly losing their lives to a head-on collision on an icy road.


=== 2011: The Darcys (self-titled) ===
Despite the release of Endless Water, the band will argue that their ""true"" first release came in 2011 with their self-titled Arts & Crafts debut, which marked the first of a three-record deal with the Toronto label responsible for prominent Canadian acts such as Broken Social Scene and Feist. The 10-track release received production from Murray Lightburn of The Dears and was mixed by Dave Schiffman (Rage Against The Machine, Weezer). The album was offered as a free download on the band's website, drawing many comparisons to Radiohead for its ""lushly layered, lightly proggy arrangements."" A music video was released for the album's second track, ""Don't Bleed Me"".


=== 2012: AJA ===
Only months after releasing their self-titled album, The Darcys released their interpretation of Steely Dan’s 1977 release Aja. As Marskell mentions, the choice to cover the entire album ""existed solely to redirect conversation"" surrounding the band's self-titled release. The release gained much criticism for recreating an album that ""cannot be duplicated or reinterpreted"", while also receiving praise for being ‘compelling’ and bringing out the ‘dark-hued’ nature of the lyrical content. On November 11, 2012, the band presented ‘An Interpretation Of Steely Dan's Aja’ live at Toronto's historic Lee's Palace. A mini documentary was made by Adrian Vieni of Wood & Wires Productions, discussing the decision to re-imagine the album with interviews and live footage. A music video was also released for the track ‘Josie’.


=== 2013: Warring ===
In late 2013, The Darcys delivered the third installment of a three album series with Warring. The band discussed accomplishing the album in a statement explaining: ""It's learning in motion. Competition and survival, letting go to persevere. It is anxiety about the future and the triumph of life in the moment. It's victory on will alone, the force that eradicates failure as an option."" The album is strongly influenced by the work of American novelist Cormac McCarthy, specifically his book Blood Meridian, which can be seen through the lyrical content. The 10-track album features artwork done by Toronto artist/graphic designer Sara Cwynar, as well as production from Tom McFall (Stars) and mixing from previous contributor, Dave Schiffman. Six music videos have been released to accompany the tracks ‘Pretty Girls’, ‘Itchy Blood’, ‘The River’, ‘Hunting’, ‘The Pacific Theatre’ and ‘Horses Fell’ from the album. Warring marked the band's first Juno nomination in 2014 for Alternative Album of the Year, and also earned a spot on the 2014 Polaris Music Prize longlist.


=== 2013-2014: Play In School Campaign and ""Hymn For A Missing Girl"" ===
The Darcys embarked on their Play in School campaign in November 2013, to support the continuation of public school music programs and engage youths in embracing the importance of the arts as a part of their development. The band was turned on to the idea when the Toronto District School Board intended to cut its musical programs, in addition to receiving countless messages from young fans who were unable to attend their mainly 19+ shows. This campaign has enabled The Darcys to visit multiple high schools across Southern Ontario with the intention of encouraging students nationwide to ""hold their school boards accountable to maintain and develop music programs.""In celebration of Record Store Day, The Darcys released ""Hymn for a Missing Girl"" in 2014 as an epilogue to Warring. The 22-minute instrumental, split into five movements, continues the trend of its predecessor with inspiration being drawn from Cormac McCarthy’s Cities of the Plain. The track was released online, though it was limited to 500 vinyl copies in North America.
The band has also released the track ""Ultra Violet"", a bonus track from the recording sessions of the 2013 album. In addition to working on a follow-up to Warring and touring rigorously, Marskell has been contributing to The Huffington Post by occasionally writing articles for their Canada Music section, mainly recounting The Darcys’ tour experiences.

== Synopsis ==
Vin and Marge Shipley live above a fish and chip shop in South London, with their only son Keith. Things are tough in South London and Keith wants to make his misery guts parents smile again, so he buys a brilliantly coloured tropical fish from Australia. All his efforts to cheer his parents fail, so Keith decides he must find a way to get his parents to Australia, where the sun shines all the time. At some point, Keith accidentally burns down his parents' shop. The Shipleys decide to migrate to Australia with the insurance money. They arrive at Orchid Cove, a small fictional town in Australia. Keith believes it is a paradise. He meets a girl, around his age, named Tracy.
The Shipleys open a new fish and chip shop in Orchid Cove named Paradise Fish 'n' Chips and Tracy introduces Keith to some interesting activities in Orchid Cove, such as surfing. The Shipleys' new shop is getting along and the Shipleys become friends with Wogga, Tracy's father and Dougie, the mechanic. Arrogant businessman Arnold Flashman opens up a rival fish and chip shop named Ocean Fresh Fish 'n' Fries near the Shipleys' store. The people who work there are frauds who don't catch their own fish or make their own chips. However they still have better equipment than the Shipleys do, which worries the Shipleys. To make matters worse, a storm hits the shop and damages most of the equipment. However, Keith thinks of something. With the help of Tracy, he decides to paint the shop to attract new customers.
As competition grows, Keith decides to support his family further by sneaking out to discover opals in the opal fields in Southern Australia. On his way, he is kidnapped by Coal, a trucker, and servo station owner, Mic. Mic releases Keith on the promise that Keith paints a picture of Coal's truck. Seeing the beautiful image, Coal decides to give Keith a ride to the opal fields. Meanwhile, Tracy finds out that Keith has been kidnapped and informs Wogga. Wogga decides to follow Vin and Marge Shipley, who have already started to look for Keith. Eventually, Tracy finds Keith in a tunnel. Frustrated, Keith digs at the tunnel furiously, which leads to the collapse of the tunnel. Tracy happened to bring her dog Buster with her, and with Buster's help, both Keith and Tracy are able to escape. Tracy, Wogga, Keith, Marge and Vin are happily reunited.
After returning home, a frustrated and devastated Vin decides to sell his shop to Flashman. Keith begs him not to sell the shop and decides to organize a Fish 'n' Chips Championship to determine the best Fish 'n' chips maker in Orchid Cove. The judge who is Baz, the town's police sergeant, rules that Paradise Fish 'n' Chips are better than Ocean Fresh Fish 'n' Fries and the Shipleys' shop stays in business, while Flashman leaves Orchid Cove for good.

National Holocaust Monument,"The National Holocaust Monument (French: Monument national de l'Holocauste) is a Holocaust memorial in Ottawa, Ontario, across from the Canadian War Museum at the northeast corner of Wellington and Booth Streets, and about 1.5 km away from Parliament Hill. The memorial was designed by Daniel Libeskind.The National Holocaust Monument Act (Bill C-442), which established plans to create the memorial in Canada's capital, received Royal Assent on March 25, 2011. The law was introduced as a private members bill by Tim Uppal, Minister of State and MP for Edmonton—Sherwood Park and received unanimous support.The monument features a view of the Peace Tower and photographs by Edward Burtynsky. The team was led by Lord Cultural Resources.The monument is overseen by the National Capital Commission.
The monument was planned to be unveiled in the fall of 2015, but later pushed back to the spring of 2017 due to delays in construction. The official unveiling occurred on September 27, 2017. In 2017, when the National Holocaust Monument of Canada was unveiled in Ottawa, the opening plaque made no mention of the six million Jews killed by the Nazis. Subsequently, chair Rabbi Daniel Friedman took responsibility for the error.The monument was built due to the persistent activism of former University of Ottawa student, Laura Grosman. Laura began advocating for a monument to be built commemorating the Nazis atrocities and as a beacon of light for Canadian Holocaust survivors. She campaigned and met with various Members of Parliament to support the introduction of a Private Members Bill. She is the granddaughter of a Polish-born Holocaust survivor.

Washington Commanders,"The Washington Commanders are a professional American football team based in the Washington metropolitan area. The Commanders compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) East division. The team plays its home games at FedExField in Landover, Maryland; its headquarters and training facility are in Ashburn, Virginia. The team has played more than 1,000 games and is one of only five in the NFL with more than 600 total wins. Washington was among the first NFL franchises with a fight song: ""Hail to the Commanders"", played by their marching band after every touchdown scored by the team at home. The franchise is owned by a group headed by Josh Harris, who acquired the team from Daniel Snyder in 2023 for $6.05 billion.
The franchise was founded by George Preston Marshall as the Boston Braves in 1932. The team changed its name to the Redskins the following year before moving to Washington, D.C., in 1937, to become the Washington Redskins. The Redskins' branding was controversial for decades. In 2020, pressure from several NFL and team sponsors led to its being retired as part of a wave of name changes in the wake of the George Floyd protests, which led to larger awareness of the Native American mascot controversy. The team played as the Washington Football Team for two seasons before rebranding as the Commanders in 2022.
Washington won the 1937 and 1942 NFL championship games and Super Bowls XVII, XXII, and XXVI. Washington has finished a season as league runner-up six times, losing the 1936, 1940, 1943, and 1945 title games and Super Bowls VII and XVIII. With 14 division titles and 24 postseason appearances, they have an overall postseason record of 23–18. Their three Super Bowl wins are tied with the Denver Broncos, Kansas City Chiefs and Las Vegas Raiders, behind the Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots (six each), San Francisco 49ers and Dallas Cowboys (five each), and the Green Bay Packers and New York Giants (four each).
All of Washington's championships were attained during two 10-year spans. From 1936 to 1945, the team went to the NFL Championship six times, winning two of them. The second period lasted from 1982 to 1991 under owner Jack Kent Cooke, general managers Bobby Beathard and Charley Casserly, and head coach Joe Gibbs. From 1946 to 1970, Washington posted just four winning seasons and never reached the postseason. They went without a single winning season from 1956 to 1968, a span that included their worst regular-season record: 1–12–1 in 1961. Since their last Super Bowl victory in 1991, they have won the NFC East four times with only seven postseason appearances.


== Franchise history ==


=== George Preston Marshall era (1932–1965) ===
The city of Boston was awarded an NFL franchise on July 9, 1932, under the ownership of American businessman George Preston Marshall. The team was named after the Boston Braves baseball team, with whom they shared Braves Field. The following year the team moved to Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox, and changed the team's name to the ""Redskins"". Marshall hired William Henry ""Lone Star"" Dietz, who claimed to be part Sioux, as the team's head coach.


==== Ray Flaherty years (1936–1942) ====
The Redskins appeared in the 1936 NFL Championship Game, their first championship appearance, but lost to the Green Bay Packers 21–6.


===== NFL champions (1937) =====
The Redskins moved to Washington, D.C., after just five years in Boston, with Marshall stating that the city showed a lack of interest in the team. Through 1960, the team shared baseball's Griffith Stadium with the first American League Washington Senators baseball team. In their first game in Washington, the Redskins defeated the New York Giants in the season opener, 13–3. That same season, they earned their first division title in Washington with a 49–14 win over the Giants. Shortly after, the team won their first league championship in 1937, defeating the Chicago Bears.In 1940, the Redskins met the Bears again in the 1940 NFL Championship Game. The result, 73–0 in favor of the Bears, remains the worst one-sided loss in NFL history.


===== NFL champions (1942) =====
In what became an early rivalry in the NFL, the Redskins and Bears met twice more in the NFL Championship Game: in 1942, the Redskins won their second championship, 14–6


==== Bergman and DeGroot years (1943–1945) ====
In 1943, Dutch Bergman was named head coach and led the team to a return to the NFL championship game, however they were defeated by the Chicago Bears 41–21. That same season, Sammy Baugh led the NFL in passing, punting, and interceptions.The Redskins played in the NFL Championship one more time before a quarter-century drought that lasted until the 1972 season. With former Olympic gold medalist Dudley DeGroot as their new head coach, the Redskins went 8–2 during the 1945 season. One of the most impressive performances came from Baugh, who had a completion percentage of .703. They ended the season by losing to the Cleveland Rams in the 1945 NFL Championship Game, 15–14. The one-point margin of victory came under scrutiny because of a safety that occurred early in the game. In the first quarter, the Redskins had the ball at their own 5-yard line. Dropping back into the end zone, quarterback Baugh threw to an open receiver, but the ball hit the goal post and bounced back to the ground in the end zone. Under the rules at the time, this was ruled as a safety and thus gave the Rams a 2–0 lead. Marshall was so upset at the outcome that he became a major force in passing a major rule change after the season, in which a forward pass that struck the goalpost was automatically ruled incomplete. This later became known as the ""Baugh/Marshall Rule"".The team's early success endeared it to the fans of Washington, D.C. However, after 1945, the Redskins began a slow decline that they did not end until a playoff appearance in the 1971 season. The Redskins had four different head coaches from 1946 to 1951, including former players Turk Edwards and Dick Todd as well as John Whelchel and Herman Ball, and none were successful. But this did not stop George Preston Marshall from trying to make the Redskins the most successful franchise in the league. His first major alteration happened on June 14, 1950, when it was announced that American Oil Company planned to televise all Redskins games, making Washington the first NFL team to have an entire season of televised games. His next major change came in February 1952, when he hired former Green Bay Packers coach Earl ""Curly"" Lambeau. But, after two seasons, Marshall fired Lambeau following the Redskins loss in their exhibition opener to the Los Angeles Rams and hired Joe Kuharich. In 1955, Kuharich led the Redskins to their first winning season in ten years and was named both Sporting News Coach of the Year and UPI NFL Coach of the Year.In 1961, the Redskins moved into their new stadium called D.C. Stadium (changed to Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in 1969). The first game in new D.C. Stadium occurred on October 1 in front of 37,767 fans. However, the Redskins failed to hold a 14-point lead and lost to the New York Giants 24–21. That same year, Bill McPeak became the head coach and had a record of 21–46–3 over five seasons. During his tenure, he helped draft future stars: wide receiver Charley Taylor, tight end Jerry Smith, safety Paul Krause, center Len Hauss, and linebacker Chris Hanburger. He also helped pull off two important trades, gaining quarterback Sonny Jurgensen from the Philadelphia Eagles and linebacker Sam Huff from the New York Giants. In 1966, Otto Graham was hired as the new head coach. Graham coached the Redskins for three seasons for a record of 17–22–3. He resigned after the 1968 season in favor of Vince Lombardi.
at 6–8.


==== Integration controversy ====
During most of this unsuccessful period, Marshall continually refused to integrate the team, despite pressure from The Washington Post and the federal government. Two months into the Kennedy administration on March 24, 1961, Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall warned Marshall to hire black players or face federal retribution. For the first time in history, the federal government had attempted to desegregate a professional sports team. The Redskins were under the threat of civil rights legal action by the Kennedy administration, which would have prevented a segregated team from playing at the new federally-owned D.C. Stadium, managed by the U.S. Department of the Interior. The Redskins' previous venue, Griffith Stadium, was owned by the Griffith family, owners of the Washington Senators, who moved and became the Minnesota Twins in 1961.
In 1962, Washington became the final professional American football franchise to integrate. First, the Redskins selected running back Ernie Davis of Syracuse first overall in the 1962 NFL Draft; Davis was the first black player to win the Heisman Trophy and the first to be the top selection in an NFL draft. Washington also took fullback Ron Hatcher of Michigan State in the eighth round, who became the first black player to sign a contract with the team.In December 1961, Marshall announced he had traded the rights to Davis to the Cleveland Browns, who wanted Davis to join the league's leading rusher, Jim Brown, in their backfield. Davis was traded for veteran running back Bobby Mitchell (who became a wide receiver in Washington) and 1962 first-round draft choice Leroy Jackson of Western Illinois. The move was made under unfortunate circumstances – as it turned out that Davis had leukemia, and died without ever playing a down in professional football. The Redskins ended the 1962 season with their best record in five years: 5–7–2. Mitchell led the league with 11 touchdowns, and caught 72 passes and was selected to the Pro Bowl. In time, Mitchell would be joined by other black players like receiver Charley Taylor, running back Larry Brown, defensive back Brig Owens, and guard John Nisby.


=== Edward Bennett Williams era (1965–1974) ===
Marshall became seriously ill by the mid-1960s and died on August 9, 1969. Washington-based attorney and minority stockholder Edward Bennett Williams took over as acting owner in 1965 while majority stockholder, Jack Kent Cooke, ran the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers. In 1969, the team hired Vince Lombardi, who had gained fame coaching with the Green Bay Packers, to be their new head coach. Lombardi led the team to a 7–5–2 record, their best since 1955, but died of cancer on the eve of the 1970 season. Assistant coach Bill Austin was the interim head coach in 1970, and Washington finished at 6–8.


=== Jack Kent Cooke era (1974–1999) ===


==== George Allen years (1971–1977) ====
After the death of Lombardi and Austin's unsuccessful 1970 season, former Los Angeles Rams head coach George Allen was named to the same position on January 6, 1971. Partial to seasoned veterans instead of highly touted young players, Allen's teams became known as the Over-the-Hill Gang. That season, the Redskins made the playoffs for the first time since 1945 with a 9–4–1 mark with Redskins first-year head coach George Allen winning the 1971 NFL Coach of the Year Award, the second of his career, winning his first Coach of the Year Award in 1967 as the head coach of the Rams. However, they lost in the Divisional Playoffs to the San Francisco 49ers, 24–20. The following season, the Redskins hosted their first post-season game in Washington since 1942, where they beat the Green Bay Packers 16–3 in the NFC Divisional Playoffs. The Redskins reached the NFC Championship Game, and in a much-anticipated match-up against the archrival Dallas Cowboys, the Redskins would not disappoint. The Redskins placekicker Curt Knight kicked an 18-yard field goal in the second quarter to get the scoring underway, then Redskins quarterback Billy Kilmer connected with Redskins wide receiver Charley Taylor on a 15-yard touchdown pass and Washington had a 10–3 lead at halftime. In the fourth quarter, Kilmer again went to Taylor, this time for a 45-yard touchdown. Knight added three more field goals that period and The Over-The-Hill-Gang defense allowed only a second-quarter field goal. The final score was Washington 26, Dallas 3. After defeating the Dallas Cowboys to win the NFC Championship, the Redskins went on to lose to the undefeated Miami Dolphins 14–7 in Super Bowl VII. Redskins running back Larry Brown would be named the 1972 NFL's Most Valuable Player.

Jack Kent Cooke took over as controlling owner from Edward Bennett Williams in 1974 and sold the Lakers to Jerry Buss in 1979 to fully focus on the Redskins. The Redskins again made the playoffs in 1973, 1974, and 1976, only to lose all three times in the first round. After his Redskins failed to make the playoffs in 1977 despite posting a 9–5 record, Allen was fired and was replaced by new head coach Jack Pardee, a star linebacker under Allen in Los Angeles and Washington. In his first year, his team started 6–0 but then lost 8 of the last 10 games.
The Redskins selected Don Warren and Monte Coleman during the 1979 NFL Draft. They opened the 1979 season 6–2 and were 10–5 heading into the season finale at Texas Stadium, against whom a win would assure a playoff spot and a possible NFC East title. Washington led 34–28 with time running out, but quarterback Roger Staubach then led the Cowboys in a fourth-quarter comeback with two touchdown passes. The 35–34 loss knocked the 10–6 Redskins out of playoff contention. Pardee's quick success with the team did not go unnoticed, however, and he was named Associated Press Coach of the Year and UPI NFC Coach of the Year. Pardee's tenure did not last long though, for he was fired after posting a 6–10 record in 1980. He did, however, draft Art Monk in the first round.


==== Joe Gibbs years (1981–1992) ====
On January 13, 1981, owner Jack Kent Cooke signed the offensive coordinator of the San Diego Chargers, Joe Gibbs, as their head coach. Also during the off-season, the Redskins acquired Mark May, Russ Grimm, and Dexter Manley in the 1981 NFL Draft, all of whom became significant contributors to the team for the next few years. After starting the 1981 season 0–5, the Redskins won eight out of their next 11 games and finished the season 8–8.


===== Super Bowl XVII champions (1982) =====
Starting on September 21, 1982, the NFL faced a 57-day long players' strike, which reduced the 1982 season from a 16-game schedule to a nine-game schedule. Because of the shortened season, the NFL adopted a special 16-team playoff tournament, in which eight teams from each conference were seeded 1–8 based on their regular season records. After the strike was settled, the Redskins dominated, winning six out of the seven remaining games to make the playoffs for the first time since 1976.In January 1983, during the second round of the playoffs against the Minnesota Vikings, John Riggins rushed for a Redskins playoff record 185 yards, leading Washington to a 21–7 win. The game is perhaps best known for a moment when the stadium physically shook as a crowd chanted ""We Want Dallas!"", which later became a rallying cry of sorts for Redskin fans before games against the Cowboys. In the NFC Championship Game against them at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, Redskins defensive end Dexter Manley knocked Cowboys' quarterback Danny White out for the rest of the game and sent him into the locker room shortly before halftime. Later in the game, Redskins defensive tackle Darryl Grant's interception, which he returned for a 10-yard touchdown, off one of Cowboys' backup quarterback Gary Hogeboom's passes which was tipped by Dexter Manley to score the decisive points. John Riggins rushed for 140 yards and two touchdowns on 36 carries and the Redskins went on to defeat the Cowboys' by a score of 31–17. The Redskins' first Super Bowl win, and their first NFL Championship in 40 years, was in Super Bowl XVII, where the Redskins defeated the Miami Dolphins 27–17. Riggins provided the game's signature play when, on 4th and inches, with the Redskins down 17–13, the coaches called ""70 Chip"", a play designed for short yardage. Riggins instead gained 43 yards (39 meters) by running through would-be tackler Don McNeal and getting the go-ahead touchdown. The Redskins ended up winning by a 27–17 score with John Riggins winning the Super Bowl MVP.
After the 1982 season Redskins placekicker Mark Moseley was the first and only placekicker in NFL history to be named the NFL's Most Valuable Player; Moseley made 20 of 21 field goals attempted in 1982. Redskins head coach Joe Gibbs also won his first NFL Coach of the Year Award in 1982 which was the first of his back-to-back NFL Coach of the Year Awards, his second coming in the 1983 NFL season.

The 1983 season marked the rookie debut of cornerback Darrell Green, selected in the 1983 NFL Draft along with Charles Mann, Green would go on to play his entire 20-year NFL career for the Redskins. On October 1, 1983, the Redskins lost to the Green Bay Packers 48–47 in the highest-scoring Monday night football game in history, in which both teams combine for more than 1,000 yards (910 m) of total offense. Then during the regular-season finale on December 17, 1983, Moseley set an NFL scoring record with 161 points while Riggins' total of 144 points was second. This marked the first time since 1951 that the top two scorers in a season played on the same team. They dominated the NFL with a 14-win season which included scoring a then NFL record 541 points, many of which came from Riggins, who scored 24 touchdowns. Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann would also be named the 1983 NFL's Most Valuable Player finishing the season with a career-high in both yards passing 3,714 yds., and touchdown passes thrown, 29 Td's while throwing only 11 interceptions. In the postseason, the Redskins beat the Los Angeles Rams 51–7. The next week, Washington beat the San Francisco 49ers 24–21 in the NFC Championship Game. It was their final win of the season because two weeks later, the Raiders beat the Redskins 38–9 in Super Bowl XVIII.The Redskins finished the 1984 season with an 11–5 record, and won the NFC East for the third consecutive season. However, they lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Chicago Bears, 23–19. On November 18, 1985, while playing against the Giants, Theismann broke his leg during a sack by Lawrence Taylor. The compound fracture forced him to retire after a 12-year career, during which he became the Redskins' all-time leader in pass attempts and completions. The Redskins finished 3rd in the NFC East behind the Cowboys and missed the wild card to the Giants by virtue of tiebreakers.
The 1986 offseason's major highlight occurred during the 1986 NFL Draft, when the Redskins picked up future Super Bowl MVP Mark Rypien in the sixth round, also the Redskins defensive end Dexter Manley set a franchise single-season record when he recorded 18.5 sacks while earning 1st Team All-Pro honors and being selected to the Pro bowl. In 1986 season, the road to the playoffs was even harder, with the Redskins making the postseason as a wild-card team despite having a regular-season record of 12–4. They won the Wild Card playoff against the Rams, and then again in the Divisional playoffs against the Bears. This game was Gibbs's 70th career, which made him the winningest head coach in Redskins history. The season ended next week, however, when the Redskins lost to the eventual Super Bowl XXI Champion Giants 17–0 in the NFC Championship game.


===== Super Bowl XXII champions (1987) =====

The 1987 season began with a 24-day players' strike that reduced the 16-game season to 15. No Redskins players crossed the picket line—the only such team—and the games for Weeks 4–6 were won with all-replacement squads. Those three victories, often credited with getting the team into the playoffs, are the basis for the 2000 movie The Replacements. The Redskins won their second championship in Super Bowl XXII on January 31, 1988, in San Diego, California. The Redskins routed the Denver Broncos 42–10 after starting the game down 10–0, the largest come-from-behind victory in Super Bowl history, which was tied by the New Orleans Saints in Super Bowl XLIV and the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX. This game is also noted for Super Bowl MVP quarterback Doug Williams, who threw four touchdowns in the second quarter en route to becoming the first black quarterback to lead his team to a championship, and for rookie running back Timmy Smith, who ran for a Super Bowl-record 204 yards (187 m).In 1988, the club had a 5–3 record at mid-season, but a second-half swoon saw them miss the playoffs with a 7–9 record.
The 1989 Redskins finished with a 10–6 record but missed the playoffs. The team is best remembered for ""The Posse""—Art Monk, Gary Clark, and Ricky Sanders—the first trio of NFL wide receivers to post more than 1,000 yards apiece in a single season. Also, Redskins head coach Joe Gibbs achieved his 100th career victory in a week-14 win against the San Diego Chargers. The Redskins returned to the playoffs in 1990 as a Wild Card team, but lost in the Divisional round to the 49ers.


===== Super Bowl XXVI champions (1991) =====
The 1991 season started with a franchise-record 11 straight victories. ""The Hogs"", under the coaching of Redskins offensive line coach Joe Bugel, allowed a league-low and franchise-record nine sacks, the third-lowest total in NFL history. The offense also dominated under head football coach Joe Gibbs, scoring 485 points, more than any other team that year. The defense was also dominant under defensive coordinator Richie Petitbon, giving up 224 total points, second-best of any team that year, while holding opponents scoreless three times. After posting a 14–2 record, the Redskins dominated the playoffs, beating the Falcons and Lions by a combined score of 64–17. On January 26, 1992, the Redskins won Super Bowl XXVI by defeating the Buffalo Bills 37–24; QB Mark Rypien won the Super Bowl MVP award. After the Super Bowl, the Redskins set another franchise record by sending eight players to the Pro Bowl. The 1991 Washington Redskins are widely considered one of the best teams in NFL history.
In 1992, the Redskins reached the playoffs as a wild-card team, but lost in the Divisional playoffs to the 49ers, 20–13. On October 12, 1992, Art Monk became the NFL's all-time leading pass receiver by catching his 820th career reception against the Denver Broncos on Monday Night Football. The era ended on March 5, 1993, when Gibbs retired after 12 years of coaching with the Redskins. Gibbs later founded Joe Gibbs Racing.After the end of Gibbs' first tenure, the Redskins hired former Redskins player Richie Petitbon for the 1993 season. However, his first and only year as head coach, the Redskins finished with a record of 4–12. Petitbon was fired at the end of the season and on February 2, 1994, Norv Turner was hired as head coach after being the offensive coordinator of the Dallas Cowboys. 1994 was even worse as they finished 3–13, their worst season in over 30 years. Their sole bright spot that year came on October 9, 1994, linebacker Monte Coleman played in his 206th career game with the Redskins, which broke Art Monk's team record for games played (Coleman retired at season's end with 216 games played). They improved to 6–10 in 1995 where they were able to get a season sweep on the eventual Super Bowl XXX Champions the Dallas Cowboys. On March 13, 1996, Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke, Maryland Governor Parris Glendening, and Prince George's County Executive Wayne K. Curry signed a contract that paved the way for the immediate start of construction for the new home of the Redskins (now FedExField). The 1996 season saw Washington post their first winning record in 4 years by finishing 9–7. On December 22, 1996, the Redskins played their final game at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, a victory over the Dallas Cowboys 37–10, and finished their tenure at the stadium with a 173–102–3 record, including 11–1 in the playoffs.On April 6, 1997, Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke died of congestive heart failure at the age of 84. In his will, Cooke left the Redskins to the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, with instructions that the foundation sell the team. His estate, headed by son John Kent Cooke, took over ownership of the Redskins and at his memorial service, John Kent Cooke announced that the new stadium in Landover, Maryland, would be named Jack Kent Cooke Stadium. On September 14, 1997, the Redskins played in their new stadium for the first time and beat the Arizona Cardinals, 19–13 in overtime. On November 23, 1997, they played the New York Giants and the result was a 7–7 tie, the Redskins first tie game since the 1971 season. They would finish 1997 8–7–1 and would miss the playoffs for the fifth season in a row. One bright spot during the season, however, occurred on December 13, 1997, when Darrell Green played in his 217th career game as a Redskin, breaking Monte Coleman's record for games played.The 1998 season started with a seven-game losing streak, and the Redskins finished with a 6–10 record.


=== Daniel Snyder era (1999–2023) ===
After two seasons, John Kent Cooke was unable to raise sufficient funds to permanently purchase the Redskins, and on May 25, 1999, Daniel Snyder gained unanimous approval (31–0) from league owners and bought the franchise for $800 million, a deal that was the most expensive team-purchasing deal in sporting history. One of his first acts as team owner occurred on November 21, 1999, when he sold the naming-rights to Jack Kent Cooke Stadium to the highest bidder, FedEx, who renamed the stadium FedExField.In Snyder's first season as owner, the Redskins went 10–6, including a four-game winning streak early in the season, and made it to the playoffs for the first time in Norv Turner's career (and the first time for the Redskins since 1992) in the final game of the season (on January 2, 2000, against the Dolphins). Running back Stephen Davis rushed for a then club-record 1,405 yards and quarterback Brad Johnson completed a then club-record 316 passes and threw for more than 4,000 yards in regular play that season. They then defeated the Detroit Lions in the first round of the playoffs, but lost to the Buccaneers, 14–13.
The 2000 season started with the selection of future Pro Bowler Chris Samuels and the tumultuous LaVar Arrington in the 2000 NFL Draft and included five consecutive wins in the first half of the season. However, they ended up going 7–6 with Turner being fired as head coach prior to the end of the season. Terry Robiskie was named interim coach to finish out the season, which ended with an 8–8 record. During the final game of the season, Larry Centers became the NFL's all-time leader in receptions by a running back with 685.On January 3, 2001, the Redskins hired former Cleveland Browns and Kansas City Chiefs head coach Marty Schottenheimer as head coach. The 2001 season began with a loss to the San Diego Chargers, 30–3, two days before the September 11, 2001, attacks. On September 13, 2001, the Redskins announced the establishment of the Redskins Relief Fund to help families of the victims of the attack at the Pentagon. During the course of the season, the Redskins raised more than $700,000. They finished the season with an 8–8 record and Schottenheimer was fired after the final game. Snyder later said in a 2013 interview that he was fired due to his over-controlling nature.On January 14, 2002, Snyder hired University of Florida coach Steve Spurrier, the Redskins' fifth new head coach in 10 years. They finished with a 7–9 record, their first losing season in four years. A bittersweet moment during the season occurred on December 29, when Darrell Green concluded his 20th and final season as the Redskins defeated the Cowboys 20–14 at FedExField. During his 20 seasons, he set an NFL record for consecutive seasons with at least one interception (19) and a Redskins team record for regular-season games played (295) and started (258). The Redskins finished the 2003 season with a 5–11 record, their worst since 1994. The one bright note of the season was on December 7, when defensive end Bruce Smith sacked Giants quarterback Jesse Palmer in the fourth quarter. With his 199th career sack, Smith broke Reggie White's all-time NFL mark. After two mediocre years, Spurrier resigned after the 2003 season with three years left on his contract.
For the 2004 season, Snyder successfully lured former coach Joe Gibbs away from NASCAR to return as head coach and team president. His employment came with a promise of decreased intervention in football operations from Snyder. Snyder also expanded FedExField to a league-high capacity of 91,665 seats. Gibbs' return to the franchise did not pay instant dividends as the Redskins finished the 2004 season with a record of 6–10. Despite an impressive defense, the team struggled offensively. Quarterback Mark Brunell—an off-season acquisition from the Jacksonville Jaguars—struggled in his first season, and was replaced midway through the season by backup Patrick Ramsey. On the other hand, some of Gibbs' other new signings, such as cornerback Shawn Springs and linebacker Marcus Washington, did very well. The Redskins also picked Sean Taylor from University of Miami during the draft in Gibbs' first season.

The 2005 season started with three wins, including a win on September 19 against the Dallas Cowboys. Dallas led 13–0 with less than four minutes left when Brunell threw a 39-yard (36 m) touchdown pass to Moss on a fourth-down play. Then, with 2:44 left, Brunell connected with Moss again on a 70-yard (64 m) touchdown pass and Nick Novak kicked the game-winning extra point. It was the Redskins' first victory at Texas Stadium since 1995. They then fell into a slump, losing six of the next eight games which included three straight losses in November, and their playoff chances looked bleak. On December 18, 2005, the Redskins beat Cowboys, 35–7, which marked the first time since 1995 that the Redskins swept the season series with Dallas. The Redskins clinched their first playoff berth since 1999. The game also culminated impressive season performances by individuals. Portis set a team mark for most rushing yards in a single season with 1,516 yards (1,386 m), and Moss set a team record for most receiving yards in a single season with 1,483 yards (1,356 m), breaking Bobby Mitchell's previous record set in 1963. Also, Chris Cooley's 71 receptions broke Jerry Smith's season record for a Redskins tight end. In the first round of the playoffs, the Redskins met the Buccaneers. The Redskins won 17–10, after taking an early 14–0 lead, which they thought they lost until replay showed that a touchdown, which would have tied the game, was an incomplete pass. In that game, the Redskins broke the record for fewest offensive yards (120) gained in a playoff victory, with one of their two touchdowns being from a defensive run after a fumble recovery. The following weekend, they played the Seahawks, who defeated the Redskins 20–10, ending their hopes of reaching their first NFC Championship Game since 1991.
The first major move of the 2006 off-season was the hiring of Kansas City Chiefs' offensive coordinator Al Saunders as offensive coordinator. Gibbs also added former Buffalo Bills defensive coordinator Jerry Gray to his staff as secondary/cornerbacks coach and lost quarterbacks coach Bill Musgrave to the Falcons. The Redskins also picked up future starters Rocky McIntosh, Anthony Montgomery, Reed Doughty, and Kedric Golston in the 2006 NFL Draft. After winning only three of the first nine games, Gibbs benched quarterback Brunell for former first-round draft pick Jason Campbell. After losing his first game as a starter to Tampa Bay, Campbell got his first NFL victory against the Carolina Panthers, bringing the Redskins out of a three-game losing streak. The highlight of the season happened on November 5, and concluded with one of the most exciting endings in the history of the Cowboys–Redskins rivalry. Tied 19–19, Troy Vincent blocked a last-second field goal attempt by Dallas that would have given them the win. Sean Taylor picked up the ball and ran 30 yards (27 m), breaking tackles along the way. It was thought that the game would then go in overtime, however because of a defensive 15-yard (14 m) face mask penalty, the Redskins would get an untimed down. Novak kicked a 47-yard (43 m) field goal, giving Washington a 22–19 victory. However, the Redskins finished the year with a 5–11 record, which resulted in them being last in the NFC East. This marked the second losing season of Joe Gibbs' second term as head coach with the Redskins, compared to the one losing season he had in his first 12-year tenure as head coach.
The Redskins began the 2007 season by ""winning ugly"" starting the season off 2–0. The Redskins kept winning and losing close games, the only exception to this a 34–3 rout of the Detroit Lions. The Redskins continued to win ugly and lose ugly to be 5–3 at the halfway mark. However, the Redskins would begin to collapse. The team lost their next three games to fall to 5–6. On Monday, November 26, Redskins safety Sean Taylor was shot by home intruders early in the morning in his Miami home. The next morning, Taylor died from severe blood loss. However, the Redskins rebounded to finish 9–7 and clinch the final playoff spot in the NFC. Washington trailed 13–0 entering the 4th quarter to the Seattle Seahawks in the wild-card round, but rallied to take a 14–13 lead, but Redskins kicker Shaun Suisham missed a field goal later in the game, and the Seahawks scored on the next drive and converted the two-point conversion. To close the game, Todd Collins threw two interceptions, each returned for a touchdown, and the Redskins fell 35–14.
After Joe Gibbs announced his retirement following the 2007 season, Jim Zorn was hired as head coach and brought in a West Coast Offense. The 2008 season started well, as the Redskins started the season 6–2. Furthermore, Redskins RB Clinton Portis led the NFL in rushing yards. However, things turned for the worse in early November, when they were routed 23–6 by the Pittsburgh Steelers and Portis' injuries finally caught up to him. The Redskins continued to struggle, falling all the way to 7–7, with their only win during that six-week period being a 3-point victory of the then-2–8 Seattle Seahawks. The Redskins managed to upset the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 16, but were eliminated from playoff contention. The team's fortunes continued to slide in 2009, as they finished 4–12. Zorn was fired and replaced by Mike Shanahan after the season.

On April 4, the Redskins acquired Donovan McNabb in a trade from the rival Philadelphia Eagles. However, the Redskins struggled to a 6–10 finish, once again 4th place in the division. The McNabb era came to an abrupt end when he was traded to Minnesota in August 2011. The troublesome After cutting the injury-rattled Clinton Portis, the Redskins had no important offensive players left except for Santana Moss. Mike Shanahan surprised most observers by his decision to name John Beck, an obscure free-agent quarterback, as the starter. However, Shanahan suddenly reversed direction by naming veteran backup Rex Grossman to the starting position. In Week 1, Grossman threw for 305 yards and two touchdown passes as the Redskins crushed the Giants 28–14, ending a six-game losing streak against that team. The Washington Redskins started the season 2–0, but then struggled to a 5–11 finish, however, they managed to win both meetings over the eventual Super Bowl champion New York Giants.
In 2012, the Redskins traded several high draft picks to the St. Louis Rams in order to take Baylor quarterback Robert Griffin III second overall in the 2012 NFL Draft. Although the need for a franchise quarterback was obvious, many journalists had doubts about the value of giving up a lot for a single player. In the opening game of the season, Griffin threw for 320 yards and two touchdown passes in a 40–32 victory over the New Orleans Saints to give the team its highest-scoring game since 2005. The Redskins struggled to a 3–6 start, but in Week 11, the Redskins would host the struggling Philadelphia Eagles. Griffin would have one of the best games of his career to date, as the Redskins won 31–6 with long touchdowns to Santana Moss and Aldrick Robinson. The Redskins would win their next 6 games after that, including the crucial final game of the season against the Cowboys, which would clinch the division for and send the Redskins to the playoffs. The Redskins hosted the Seattle Seahawks in the Wild Card round but lost 24–14.
Hopes were high for a repeat division title in 2013. However, these hopes were in vain, as poor play and controversy stirred during the entire year, leading to a disastrous 3–13 campaign. Even though most players had a down year compared to 2012, Pierre Garçon had his greatest season statistically yet. Garcon broke Art Monk's 29-year-old franchise record for catches in a single season. Garcon had 113 catches total, which broke Monk's 106 catches in 1984 by seven. The Redskins fired Shanahan and most of his staff after the season.On January 9, 2014, the Redskins hired Jay Gruden as their head coach. Gruden became the eighth head coach of the team since Daniel Snyder purchased the franchise in 1999. The Redskins struggled throughout the season, having three different quarterbacks start games, amounting to a 4–12 record. Defensive coordinator Jim Haslett was fired at the end of the season.
On January 7, 2015, the Redskins hired Scot McCloughan to be their general manager. McCloughan took over control of the roster from Bruce Allen, who was given the sole title of team president after the hiring. In October 2015, the Redskins had their largest comeback win in franchise history, coming back to win against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 31–30 after being down 0–24 in the second quarter. The Redskins clinched the NFC East division title on December 26, when they beat the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 16, 38–24. The division title was their third since Snyder took over ownership of the team, and was the first since the 1999 season to be clinched before Week 17. The Redskins hosted the Green Bay Packers in the Wild Card round on January 10, 2016, but lost 35–18, ending their 2015 season. Kirk Cousins, who took over as starting quarterback in the preseason, finished the season with career highs in touchdowns (29), yards (4,166), and completion percentage (69.8%). His completion percentage led the league, while his 29 touchdowns tied him for second on the franchise single-season list.The team's offense in 2016 set several franchise records, including having over 6,000 total net yards, which was only the third time in franchise history the team had accomplished that. Quarterback Kirk Cousins also set single-season team records in attempts, completions, and passing yards, breaking many of his records he had previously set in 2015. DeSean Jackson, Pierre Garçon, Jamison Crowder, Robert Kelley, Chris Thompson, Jordan Reed, Vernon Davis, and Matt Jones all finished the season with at least 500 yards from scrimmage, tying the 2011 New Orleans Saints for the most in a single season in NFL history. Despite the numerous records set, the Redskins missed the playoffs, losing 19–10 in a ""win and in"" situation against the New York Giants in the final week of the season. However, the Redskins still finished the season with a record of 8–7–1, giving the team their first consecutive winning seasons in nearly 20 years. In contrast with the record setting offense, the team's defense had a poor season, finishing 29 out of 32 teams in total defense, which led to the firing of defensive coordinator Joe Barry, as well as three of his assistants. In 2017, Cousins had his third straight season with 4,000 passing yards while once again playing under the franchise tag. For the second straight season, the Redskins missed the playoffs, finishing 7–9.
During the 2018 offseason, the Redskins traded for quarterback Alex Smith to replace Kirk Cousins as he left for the Minnesota Vikings in free agency. Despite early success starting the season 6–3, their best start since 2008, the team finished the season 1–6 due to injuries. In a game against the Houston Texans on November 18, 2018, Alex Smith suffered a compound and spiral fracture to his tibia and fibula in his right leg when he was sacked by Kareem Jackson and J. J. Watt which forced him to miss the rest of the season. This led to Colt McCoy, Mark Sanchez, and Josh Johnson starting games in the second half of the season. The team finished at 7–9 and missed the playoffs for the third consecutive year, with a league-high 25 players on injured reserve.
Due to Smith's injury, the Redskins acquired Case Keenum from the Denver Broncos in the 2019 offseason, and drafted Dwayne Haskins from Ohio State in the 2019 NFL Draft. With a league worst 0–5 start to the season, tying with the Cincinnati Bengals, and their worst start since 2001, the Redskins fired Gruden on October 7, 2019, with offensive line coach Bill Callahan serving as the interim head coach for the rest of the season. Gruden finished as the longest-tenured head coach in the Snyder era with six seasons, a 35–49–1 regular season record and one playoff appearance. The Redskins finished the season at 3–13, with victories over the Detroit Lions and Carolina Panthers, and missed the playoffs for the fourth straight year. The record was their worst since going 3–13 in 2013 and was the second worst of any team that season, behind only the Bengals at 2–14.


==== Rebranding, investigations into Snyder (2020–2023) ====
The team underwent several changes in 2020, including retiring the Redskins name and logo and hiring former Carolina Panthers head coach Ron Rivera in the same role, as well as naming Jason Wright as team president, the first black person named to that position in NFL history. Some notable members of Rivera's staff include former Jacksonville Jaguars and Oakland Raiders head coach Jack Del Rio as defensive coordinator and Scott Turner, the son of former Redskins head coach Norv Turner, as offensive coordinator.Under Rivera and Del Rio, the team switched their defensive scheme from a 3–4 defense, which the team had used under both Shanahan and Gruden's tenure, to a 4–3 defense. Due to their 3–13 record the previous season, the team had the second overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft and selected Chase Young, who would go on to be named Defensive Rookie of the Year. Dwayne Haskins, the team's first-round draft pick from 2019, was released prior to the season's end due to ineffective play and not meeting the team's standards off the field. Despite that, Washington would eventually win the division for the first time since 2015 at 7–9, becoming only the third team in NFL history to win a division with a losing record in a non-strike year after the 2010 Seattle Seahawks and 2014 Carolina Panthers, the latter of which Rivera also coached.Earlier in 2020, minority owners Robert Rothman, Dwight Schar, and Frederick W. Smith were reported to have hired an investment banking firm to help search for potential buyers for their stake in the team, worth around 40 percent combined. The group, who bought their stake in 2003, were reported to have urged Snyder to change the name for years. In April 2021, Snyder was approved by the league for a debt waiver of $400 million to acquire the remaining 40 percent in a deal worth over $800 million.Some other additions and changes in 2021 included the team hiring Martin Mayhew as general manager and Marty Hurney as another high-ranking executive. With the hiring of Mayhew, who is black, Washington became the first team in NFL history to concurrently have a minority general manager, head coach, and president. Ryan Kerrigan, the franchise's all-time leader in sacks, left the team as a free agent to sign with the division rival Philadelphia Eagles.
A year-long independent investigation into the team's workplace culture under owner Daniel Snyder, led by lawyer Beth Wilkinson, was concluded in July 2021. It found that several incidents of sexual harassment, bullying, and intimidation were commonplace throughout the organization under his ownership. The NFL fined the team $10 million in response, with Snyder also voluntarily stepping down from running the team's day-to-day operations for a few months, giving those responsibilities to his wife Tanya. Snyder would later be investigated by the United States House Committee on Oversight and Reform for those claims, as well as accusations of financial improprieties.The team rebranded as the Commanders in 2022 and continued to see cultural changes within the organization. With the rebrand, their fight song returned with revised lyrics as ""Hail to the Commanders"", while their longtime cheerleading squad was replaced by a co-ed performance group known as the Command Force. The year also saw the team trade for Colts quarterback Carson Wentz, who was released after the season due to poor performance.


=== Josh Harris era (2023–present) ===
After mounting pressure from other league owners to sell the franchise, Snyder hired BofA Securities to explore possible transactions in November 2022. In May 2023, he reached an agreement to sell the team and FedExField to an investment group led by Josh Harris, owner of the Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Devils, for $6.05 billion. The group has 20 limited partners worth a combined $100 billion, the most in the NFL, which includes Danaher founder and art collector Mitchell Rales, basketball hall of famer Magic Johnson, 76ers and Devils co-owner David Blitzer, venture capitalist and Washington Kastles owner Mark Ein, Maverick Capital founder Lee Ainslie, Los Angeles Sparks managing partner Eric Holoman, Blue Owl Capital founders Marc Lipschultz and Doug Ostrover, financier Alejandro Santo Domingo and his family, ProShares founder Michael Sapir, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, and Cambridge Information Group CEO Andy Snyder. The sale was the highest price ever paid for a sports team and was unanimously approved by the NFL on July 20, 2023. Soon after, the team invested $40 million in improving the infrastructure of FedExField and its fan experience, including renovations and upgrades to the sound system, video board, and suites.


== Redskins name and logo controversy ==

The team's former Redskins branding, used from 1933 until 2020, was one of the leading examples of the Native American mascot controversy. Various people and groups, such as the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), considered the name a racial slur and attempted to get the team to change it for decades.In a 2013 letter, Snyder stated that while respecting those that say they are offended, a poll conducted by the Annenberg Public Policy Center in 2004 found that 90% of Native Americans were not offended by the name and logo. This poll was essentially replicated in 2016 by The Washington Post with nearly identical results. Social scientists from the University of Michigan and University of California at Berkeley performed a study in 2020 that measured Native American opinion in detail, finding that 49% had responded that the name was offensive, with the level of offense increasing to 67% for those with a stronger involvement in Native American culture.In 2014 when the franchise was entangled in a legal trademark protection case, the Washington Post announced their editorials would no longer use the ""Redskins"" name, and subsequently other news outlets would informally call them by their geographically related area such as ""the Washington pro football team"" or avoid publishing their nickname, altogether. ESPN updated their employee work policies to allow their reporters to choose how to refer to the team going forward.Following renewed attention to questions of racial justice in the wake of the murder of George Floyd and the subsequent protests in 2020, a letter signed by 87 shareholders and investors was sent to team and league sponsors Nike, FedEx, and PepsiCo urging them to cut their ties unless the name was changed. Around the same time, several retail companies began removing Redskins merchandise from their stores. In response, the team underwent a review in July 2020 and announced that it would retire its name. The team played as the Washington Football Team until rebranding as the Commanders in 2022, featuring a new logo and uniforms. In 2023, the Native American Guardians Association (NAGA) launched a petition to return to the Redskins. NAGA later sued the team for defamation after management claimed NAGA to be a ""fake"" association.


== Logos and uniforms ==
The franchise's primary colors are burgundy and gold. From 1961 through 1978, Washington wore gold pants with both the burgundy and white jerseys, although details of the jerseys and pants changed a few times during this period. Gold face masks were introduced in 1978 and remain as such to this day; previous to that they were grey. Throughout most of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, Washington was just one of three other teams that primarily wore their white jerseys at home (the others being the Dallas Cowboys and Miami Dolphins). The tradition of wearing white jerseys over burgundy pants at home, which is considered the ""classic"" look, was started by Joe Gibbs when he took over as coach in 1981. Gibbs was an assistant for the San Diego Chargers in 1979 and 1980 when the team wore white at home under head coach Don Coryell.
Their burgundy jerseys were primarily used only when the opposing team decided to wear white at home, which came mostly against the Dallas Cowboys and was normally worn over white pants. It was worn on the road against other teams that prefer to wear white at home for games occurring early in the season. From 1981 through 2000, Washington wore their white jerseys over burgundy pants at home almost exclusively. In 1994, as part of a league-wide celebration of the NFL's 75th anniversary, during certain games, the team wore special uniforms which emulated the uniforms worn by the team in its inaugural season in Washington in 1937. Both worn over gold pants, the burgundy jerseys featured gold numbers bordered in white and the white jerseys featured burgundy numbers bordered in gold. The most distinctive feature of both colors of the jersey was the patches worn on both sleeves, which were a reproduction of the patches worn on the full-length sleeves of the 1937 jerseys. Worn with these uniforms was a plain burgundy helmet with a gold facemask.
In 2001, the team wore burgundy for all home games in the preseason and regular season per a decision by Marty Schottenheimer, their coach for that year. In 2002, the team celebrated the passing of 70 years since its creation as the Boston Braves in 1932 and wore a special home uniform, a burgundy jersey over gold pants, which roughly resembled the home uniforms used from 1969 to 1978. The helmets used with this special home uniform during that year were a reproduction of the helmets used by the team from 1965 to 1969, though they wore white at home in Week 1 against the Arizona Cardinals and again in Week 17, the latter forcing the Cowboys to use their blue jerseys. This special home uniform was also worn during one game in 2003. In 2004, when Gibbs became the coach of the team once again, the team switched back to wearing white jerseys at home; in Gibbs's 16 years as head coach, the team never wore burgundy jerseys at home, even wearing a white throwback jersey in 2007.
Their white jerseys have provided three basic color combinations. The last combination consists of both white jerseys and pants. That particular combination surfaced in the first game of the 2003 season when the team was coached by Steve Spurrier, during a nationally televised game against the New York Jets, which led many sports fans and Redskins faithful alike to point out that they had never seen that particular combination before. The Redskins won six straight games, including one in the playoffs against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, wearing that combination. In the NFC Divisional Playoff game against the eventual 2005 NFC Champion Seattle Seahawks, Washington wore the all-white uniforms in hopes that they could keep their streak going; however, they lost 20–10. The white jersey over burgundy pants look reappeared in a home game against the Carolina Panthers later in 2006.
In celebration of the franchise's 75th anniversary, Washington wore a one-time throwback uniform for a home game against the New York Giants, based on their away uniform from 1970 to 1971. Players wore a white jersey with three burgundy and two gold stripes on each sleeve and the 75th-anniversary logo on the left chest. The pants were gold, with one white stripe bordered by a burgundy stripe on each side, running down each side. The helmet was gold-colored with a burgundy ""R"" logo. The helmet and uniform styles were the same as the ones the franchise used during the 1970–71 seasons. Vince Lombardi, who coached Washington in 1969 before dying during the 1970 preseason, was the inspiration behind the helmet. Lombardi pushed for the logo, which sat inside a white circle enclosed within a burgundy circle border, with Native American feathers hanging down from the side because of its similarity to the ""G"" on the helmets worn by the Green Bay Packers, who he had coached during most of the 1960s.
In a 2008 Monday Night Football game against the against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Washington wore a monochrome look by wearing burgundy jerseys over burgundy pants. This combination made two further appearances the following season against the Dallas Cowboys and New York Giants. The Redskins, starting in 2010, began to wear the burgundy jersey paired with the gold pants reminiscent of the George Allen era. Against the Tennessee Titans later that season, the team matched the gold pants with the usual white jerseys for the first time. Washington wore the same combination against the Giants on the road two weeks later.

In 2011, the Redskins wore the burgundy jersey and gold pants for five home games and a road game at Dallas, the burgundy jersey with white pants for three home games and a road game at Miami, the white jersey and burgundy pants for five road games, and the white jersey and gold pants for a Bills game in Toronto. The following year, the team wore an updated throwback uniform of the 1937 championship team that featured a helmet pattern based on the logo-less leather helmets worn at the time, in a game against the Carolina Panthers. In 2013, a newly implemented NFL rule stated that teams could not wear alternate helmets (thus limiting them to one helmet) on account of player safety. As a result, Washington wore its 1937 throwbacks with the logo removed from the regular helmet in a game versus the San Diego Chargers. That year, the Redskins removed the burgundy collar from their white jerseys in order to have better consistency with the new Nike uniforms that had debuted the previous season.Between 2014 and 2016, the team wore the gold pants with their standard uniforms, although the burgundy pants returned as part of the team's away uniform later in 2016. In 2017, Washington resurrected the all-burgundy ensemble as part of the NFL Color Rush. Nike initially provided an all-gold uniform but team officials called it ""garish"" and refused to wear it. In 2018, Washington replaced the gold pants with white for the majority of their home games. Following the franchise's name change to the Washington Football Team in 2020, their new logo was a simple ""W"" taken from the redesigned Washington wordmark while the helmet logo and striping were replaced with the player's jersey number in gold. The season also saw the return of the all-white combination for the first time since 2009.The Commanders rebranding in 2022 included new logos and uniforms featuring military-inspired motifs. The primary home uniform remained burgundy with gold and white stripes with the letters having a gold base. The team name is placed atop the numbers in front, which were also gold and trimmed in white. The road white uniform features burgundy and white gradient numbers with black trim, along with burgundy and white gradient and black sleeve stripes. Both sets are paired with either burgundy or white pants. The alternate black uniform features the team name on the left chest in gold, and numbers have a gold base with burgundy trim. Black pants are paired with this uniform with an alternate black helmet having with the ""W"" logo in front and uniform numbers on each side. A pig mascot, Major Tuddy, was also unveiled by the end of the season.


== Rivalries ==


=== Dallas Cowboys ===

The Commanders' rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys features two teams that have won 31 combined division titles and 10 championships, including eight combined Super Bowls. The rivalry started in 1960 when the Cowboys joined the league as an expansion team. During that year they were in separate conferences, but played once during the season. In 1961, Dallas was placed in the same division as the Redskins, and from that point on, they have played each other twice during every regular season.
Texas oil tycoon Clint Murchison Jr. was having a difficult time bringing an NFL team to Dallas. In 1958, Murchison heard that George Preston Marshall, owner of the Washington Redskins, was eager to sell the team. Just as the sale was about to be finalized, Marshall called for a change in terms. Murchison was outraged and canceled the whole deal. Around this time, Marshall had a falling out with the Redskin band director, Barnee Breeskin. Breeskin had written the music for the team's fight song, now known as ""Hail to the Commanders"", which gets played by the Washington Commanders Marching Band after every touchdown at home games. He wanted revenge after the failed negotiations with Marshall. He approached Tom Webb, Murchison's lawyer, and sold the rights for $2,500 (equivalent to $24,700 in 2022). Murchison then decided to create his own team, with the support of NFL expansion committee chairman, George Halas. Halas decided to put the proposition of a Dallas franchise before the NFL owners, which needed to have unanimous approval in order to pass. The only owner against the proposal was George Preston Marshall. However, Marshall found out that Murchison owned the rights to Washington's fight song, so a deal was finally struck. If Marshall showed his approval of the Dallas franchise, Murchison would return the song. The Cowboys were then founded and began playing in 1960. At the time in 2016, a matchup between the teams on Thanksgiving was the most-watched regular-season game broadcast by the NFL on Fox.


=== Philadelphia Eagles ===

The Commanders' rivalry with the Philadelphia Eagles began October 21, 1934, during Washington's first year under the Boston Redskins moniker; the Redskins defeated the Eagles 6–0 at Fenway Park. Washington leads the series 87–80–8. The Eagles have won 12 of the last 20 matchups since 2010.

=== Retired numbers ===


==== Unofficially retired ====
Some numbers are unofficially retired and are usually withheld from being selected by other players. The following numbers fall into that category.

7 Joe Theismann, QB, 1974–1985
28 Darrell Green, CB, 1983–2002
42 Charley Taylor, WR, 1964–1977
43 Larry Brown, RB, 1969–1976
44 John Riggins, RB, 1976–1979, 1981–1985
65 Dave Butz, DT, 1975–1988
70 Sam Huff, LB, 1964–1969
81 Art Monk, WR, 1980–1993The use of unofficial retired numbers drew controversy during Steve Spurrier's first year as head coach. Quarterbacks Danny Wuerffel and Shane Matthews first wore 7 and 9 respectively during training camp. The resulting controversy led to them switching to 17 and 6. During the season, reserve tight end Leonard Stephens wore number 49 for the season. After his retirement as assistant general manager, Bobby Mitchell criticized the team for not being considered for a promotion and how the team would let another player wear his number. The team's first-round selection in the 2019 NFL Draft, quarterback Dwayne Haskins, wore number 7 when he played for the Ohio State Buckeyes and wore it with the team after being granted permission from Theismann.


=== Pro Football Hall of Fame members ===
Names in bold indicate induction primarily based on accomplishments with Washington.


=== Ring of Fame ===
When the team left RFK Stadium in 1996, the signs commemorating the Washington Hall of Stars were left behind and the team began a new tradition of honoring Redskins greats via the ""Ring of Fame"", a set of signs on the upper level facade at FedExField. Unlike the Hall of Stars, which honors historical greats from all sports, the Ring of Fame is limited to honoring Redskins greats. Team founder George Preston Marshall is the only member to ever be removed once inducted, which was done in 2020. Highlighted players are also members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.


=== 90 Greatest ===
In honor of the Redskins' 70th anniversary in 2002, a panel selected the 70 Greatest Redskins to honor the players and coaches who were significant on-field contributors to the Redskins five championships. They were honored in a weekend of festivities, including a special halftime ceremony during a Redskins' win over the Indianapolis Colts. In 2012, ten more players and personnel were added to the list for the team's 80th anniversary. In 2022, ten more players were added in honor of the franchise's 90th anniversary.The panel that chose the 70 consisted of former news anchor Bernard Shaw; former player Bobby Mitchell; Senator George Allen (son of coach George Allen); broadcaster Ken Beatrice; Noel Epstein, editor for the Washington Post; former diplomat Joseph J. Sisco; Phil Hochberg, who retired in 2001 after 38 years as team stadium announcer; Pro Football Hall of Fame historian Joe Horrigan; sportscaster George Michael; sports director Andy Pollin; NFL Films president Steven Sabol; and news anchor Jim Vance.The list includes three head coaches and 67 players, of which 41 were offensive players, 23 defensive players and three special teams players. Among the 70 Greatest, there are 92 Super Bowl appearances, with 47 going once and 45 playing in more than one. 29 members possess one Super Bowl ring and 26 have more than one. Also, before the Super Bowl, members of the 70 made 18 World Championship appearances including six that participated in the Redskins' NFL Championship victories in 1937 and 1942. Bold indicates those elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.


=== Individual awards ===


=== Command Force ===
The Command Force is the team's professional dance and performance group. They were originally formed in 1962 as a cheerleading squad known as the Redskinettes, named after the team's former Redskins name. They were revamped as the Command Force upon the team's rebranding as the Commanders in 2022. They have also been referred to as the First Ladies of Football.

=== NFL records ===


==== Offense ====
The Redskins scored 541 points in 1983, which is the sixth highest total in a season of all time.
The Redskins' 72 points against the New York Giants on November 27, 1966, are the most points ever scored by an NFL team in a regular-season game, and the 72–41 score amounted to 113 points and the highest-scoring game ever in NFL history. The second-half scoring for the game amounted to 65 points, the second-highest point total for second-half scoring and the third-highest total scoring in any half in NFL history. The Redskins' 10 touchdowns are the most by a team in a single game, and the 16 total touchdowns are the most combined for a game. The Redskins' nine PATs are the second-most all-time for a single game, and the 14 combined PATs are the most ever in a game.
The Redskins set a record for most first downs in a game with 39 in a game against the Lions on November 4, 1990. They also set a record by not allowing a single first down against the Giants on September 27, 1942.
The Redskins have led the league in passing eight times: in 1938, 1940, 1944, 1947–48, 1967, 1974 and 1989. Only the San Diego Chargers have led more times. The Redskins led the league in completion percentage 11 times: in 1937, 1939–1940, 1942–45, 1947–48 and 1969–1970, second only to the San Francisco 49ers.

== Broadcasting ==

The Commanders' current flagship radio station is 100.3 WBIG-FM, which acquired the rights in 2022 as part of an agreement with iHeartMedia. Frank Herzog was the team's lead play-by-play announcer from 1979 to 2004, when he was replaced by Larry Michael. Herzog was joined from 1981 by former Redskins Sonny Jurgensen and Sam Huff. Michael retired in 2020 and was replaced by Bram Weinstein. Weinstein is joined by color analyst London Fletcher, who played linebacker for the team from 2007 to 2013, and host Julie Donaldson, the first woman to be an on-air broadcaster for an NFL team.WMAL has historically been associated with the team, having been its flagship station from 1942 to 1956, and again from 1963 through 1991—broadcasting all three of the team's Super Bowl victories. From 1992 to 1994, WTEM—which had become DC's first all-sports radio station—became the Redskins' flagship station, after which they moved to WJFK-FM. In 2006, after WJFK and CBS Radio declined to renew its rights to the team,  the Redskins moved to WWXT, WWXX, and WXTR. The stations had recently been bought by Red Zebra Broadcasting—a group co-owned by Snyder—and had become a sports radio trimulcast known as ""Triple X ESPN Radio"". Red Zebra Broadcasting would eventually acquire WTEM in 2008, making it the originating station of the simulcast, and therefore the team's flagship station.In 2017, Cumulus Media reached an agreement to carry the team's radio broadcasts on WMAL, marking its return to the station for the first time since 1991. As part of the agreement, WTEM remained the team's official flagship. In 2018, WTEM was sold to Urban One, but maintained its rights to the team.  In June 2019, WMAL flipped to sports radio itself as WSBN, taking over the local ESPN Radio affiliation from WTEM; WMAL's previous conservative talk format moved exclusively to its FM simulcast station.Telecasts of preseason games were previously carried by NBC Sports Washington in the Mid-Atlantic region. Sister NBC owned-and-operated station WRC-TV was the team's ""official"" broadcast television station, simulcasting the preseason games and airing other team-produced programs during the season. With the sale of NBC Sports Washington by NBCUniversal to Washington Capitals and Washington Wizards owner Ted Leonsis, the network declined to renew its rights to the team, although WRC will still carry preseason telecasts. Most regular season Commanders games are carried by WTTG as part of the NFL on Fox package, with the main exceptions being when the team hosts an AFC team or plays in primetime.


== U.S. presidential election superstition ==

Between 1932 and 2008, for 19 of 20 United States presidential elections, a win for the Redskins in their last home game prior to Election Day coincided with the incumbent party winning re-election. The exception was in 2004, when Republican incumbent George W. Bush won re-election despite the Green Bay Packers beating the Redskins. The trend subsequently came to an end when in 2012, Democratic incumbent Barack Obama won re-election despite the Redskins losing to the Carolina Panthers; in 2016, Republican candidate Donald Trump won the election despite the Redskins defeating the Eagles; and in 2020, Democratic candidate Joe Biden won despite Washington's win.

It has been screened at several international festivals, including Rainbow Reel Tokyo, New York Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, & Transgender Film Festival (NewFest), Taiwan International Queer Film Festival among others. It won Best Film at Romanian Gay Film Nights (Serile Filmului International Film Festival). In 2018, Altarejos made a comeback to Sinag Maynila International Film Festival in the Philippines with the film. The film won Best Film, Best Screenplay, Best Editing and Box Office Award.
Altarejos has also worked for television doing series and anthologies for Philippines top networks GMA and TV5. Using the names Jay Altarejos and Jay Altajeros (keeping the name Joselito Altarejos to his big screen features), he has directed a number of television series, notably the youth-oriented POSH and the long-running 98-episode TV series Legacy on the GMA Network.
The Revolution Knows No Gender (Filipino: Walang Kasarian Ang Digmang Bayan), directed and written by Altarejos, was set to release at an independent film festival in Manila in February 2020. The film was disqualified for deviating from a previously approved script and removed from the festival. Altarejos alleged that the decision to not screen his film was politically motivated censorship.

Sunstone,"Sunstone is a microcline or oligoclase feldspar, which when viewed from certain directions  exhibits a spangled appearance. It has been found in Southern Norway, Sweden, various United States localities and on some beaches along the midcoast of South Australia.


== Properties ==


=== Physical properties ===
The optical effect is due to reflections from inclusions of red copper, hematite, or goethite, in the form of minute scales, which are hexagonal, rhombic, or irregular in shape, and are disposed parallel to the principal cleavage-plane. These inclusions give the stone an appearance something like that of aventurine, hence sunstone is known also as ""aventurine-feldspar"". The optical effect is called schiller and the color of Oregon Sunstone is due to copper. The middle part of this crystal sparkles, and usually the color is darkest in the middle and becomes lighter toward the outer edges.
The feldspar which usually displays the aventurine appearance is oligoclase, though the effect is sometimes seen in orthoclase: hence two kinds of sunstone are distinguished as ""oligoclase sunstone"" and ""orthoclase sunstone"".


== Distribution ==
Sunstone was not popular until recently. Previously the best-known locality being Tvedestrand, near Arendal, in south Norway, where masses of the sunstone occur embedded in a vein of quartz running through gneiss.
Other locations include near Lake Baikal in Siberia, and several United States localities—notably at Middletown Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania; Plush, Oregon; and Statesville, North Carolina.

The ""orthoclase sunstone"" variant has been found near Crown Point and at several other localities in New York, as also at Glen Riddle in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, and at Amelia Courthouse, Amelia County, Virginia.
Sunstone is also found in Pleistocene basalt flows at Sunstone Knoll in Millard County, Utah.


== Andesine controversy ==
In the early 2000s, a new variety of red or green gemstone resembling sunstone and known as ""Andesine"" appeared in the gem market.  After much controversy and debate, most of these gemstones, allegedly sourced from China, were subsequently discovered to have been artificially colored by a copper diffusion process. A Tibetan source of bona fide (untreated) red andesine, however, was eventually verified by a number of independent groups of well-respected gemologists.


== Oregon sunstone ==
A variety known as ""Oregon sunstone"" is found in Harney County, Oregon and in eastern Lake County north of Plush. Oregon Sunstone contains elemental copper. Oregon Sunstone is unique in that crystals can be quite large. The copper leads to variant color within some stones, where turning one stone will result in manifold hues: the more copper within the stone, the darker the complexion.On August 4, 1987, the Oregon State Legislature designated Oregon Sunstone as its state gemstone by joint resolution.

Bochumer Hut,"The Bochumer Hut (German: Bochumer Hütte, 1,432 m above sea level (AA)), also called Kelchalm or Kelchalpe, is an Alpine club hut in the Kitzbühel Alps in the Austrian state of Tyrol. It is owned by the Bochum Section of the German Alpine Club. Today the hut is a popular destination for hikers and also has overnight accommodation.


== History ==
The hut was built in 1832 as accommodation for miners in the copper mining industry. Following the closure of the mine in 1926 the house was rented to the Kitzbühel Alpine Club section and opened in 1928 as a proper Alpine club hut. In 1939 the hut was purchased by the German Alpine Club section in Magdeburg. After the Second World War the Magdeburg Section was dispossessed and the Kitzbühel Section took over the management of the hut. On 30 March 1964 the Bochum Section took over the Alpine club hut and the Kelchalm was given the name Bochumer Hütte.


=== Prehistoric discovery ===
At the end of the 19th century traces of a Bronze Age copper mine were found by the prehistorian, Matthäus Much, in the area of the Kelchalpe. During subsequent excavations from the 1930s to 1950s further discoveries were made that are displayed in Kitzbühel's town museum.

A.LI.CE,"A.LI.CE is a 2000 Japanese 3D CG science fiction comedy-drama anime film directed by Kenichi Maejima. It was the first ever anime to be entirely computer-animated.


== Plot ==
In the year 2000, shortly after her best friend's sudden suicide, a Japanese schoolgirl named Alice wins a competition to be the youngest person ever to be sent into space, on a semi-commercial space airline. However, something goes wrong during the flight, and the shuttle crashes, killing all on board except for Alice and the stewardess robot, SS1X. Finding themselves in a desolate, snowy landscape, they set out to find help.
A young man named Yuan aids them, and reveals that they are in Lapland, the year is 2030, and the world's population is only one billion. At first he does not believe their claims to be from 30 years in the past. Yuan helps Alice and SS1X avoid the army which appears and begins pursuing her. Together they find enough old newspapers to discover what has happened in the years they have missed. A dictator known as Nero, and his computer named SS10X, have apparently been systematically capturing people and removing them to concentration camps, thus erasing all but one billion people. Most towns are empty and technology is old and decaying.
It is revealed that the pursuing army is the Liberation Army, who directly oppose Nero. Alice, Yuan, and SS1X are captured and taken to the army's centre of operations. There, it is revealed that there is a mysterious connection between Alice and Nero's computer, and that, as a result, only Alice is able to hack into the computer and disable Nero's security systems. The Liberation Army plan to disable all the security and storm Nero's base to assassinate him and end his dictatorship. Alice agrees to hack the computer for the Liberation Army, despite being warned that it will be at great risk to herself. She uses a virtual reality device to float through the workings of the computer, disabling much of its workings but causing her mind great pain. With the automated security turned off, the Liberation Army sends all their troops to Nero's base for their final assault.
Yuan and SS1X, meanwhile, escape from their imprisonment and race to stop Alice from hacking any further before she causes herself serious harm. Alice, aware that her connection to Nero's computer, SS10X, is not a coincidence, says that she feels she needs to finally meet Nero. They all travel to Nero's base, narrowly avoiding the security systems which are just beginning to reactivate. The entirety of the Liberation Army are killed by the security robots, except for its leader, Kaspar.
Kaspar reveals that it was he who sabotaged Alice's space flight by replacing her space shuttle with a duplicate which contained a hidden time machine but was otherwise identical to the original. Kaspar had realised that Nero was the only person other than Kaspar himself potentially capable of building a time machine of his own, so he brought the only person compatible with Nero's SS10X computer, Alice, from the past to destroy Nero before he ever had the chance to build his own time machine. By removing Nero, his only obstacle, Kaspar intends to use his time machine to insert himself into key moments of history so that he is ultimately seen as a god.
Nero's security system manages to activate enough to impale and kill the megalomaniac Kaspar, however, not before Kaspar fires shots into Nero's huge computer, causing the beginning of its destruction. Alice finally approaches Nero himself, who reveals that he is her son. He explains that Alice fell into a coma shortly after his birth, and that despite his genius intellect, he only ever wanted nothing more than to communicate with her. He built his computer, based on the SS1X model Alice had known as the stewardess on her space flight, in an effort to see into the mind of the comatose Alice. This is why Alice is the only person able to hack the computer: it is tuned only to her mind.
Unfortunately, in her coma, the older Alice only mentally repeats the last words of her best friend who had committed suicide in the year 2000. Her friend had mused that the sky was not as blue as it should be, due to the pollution caused by human overpopulation. Acting on this, the SS10X computer began to decrease the human population to bring about a natural blue sky. Nero was never the dictator responsible for the wasteland of 2030, but the unconscious and unaware Alice was.
As the massive computer begins to fall apart, Alice begs Nero to escape with her. However, he says that having finally spoken with his mother, he is happy at last. He realises that his attempt to reach his mother inadvertently brought about a dictatorship and mass destruction, so he chooses to die rather than escape. Alice flees the base with Yuan and SS1X just as the destruction of SS10X reaches its peak. In the heart of the enormous computer, the suspended, comatose body of an older Alice is glimpsed.
Alice uses the space shuttle, with its time machine, to travel back to 2000. She intends to prevent the terrible future she has seen. Meanwhile, SS1X reveals to Yuan that she found data log files in Nero's base that reveal where the missing seven billion people are being kept, and that together they can rescue them all, including Yuan's parents. As Alice flies back into the past, she reflects on all she has experienced before passing out from the high forces of atmospheric re-entry. The shuttle lands safely in the ocean, and a rescue crew manage to break into the hull. As she awakens, the first thing Alice sees is a young member of the rescue crew, holding his hand out to her, wearing the same necklace that Nero wore. The film ends as she smiles and reaches for his hand.

Iowa Highway 333,"Iowa Highway 333 (Iowa 333) is a short highway in southwestern Iowa.  It serves as a connector route between Interstate 29 (I-29) and U.S. Highway 275 (US 275) in Hamburg.  Formerly spanning two counties, Iowa 333 is one of the shortest state highways in Iowa.


== Route description ==
Iowa 333 begins at exit 1 along I-29, approximately two miles (3.2 km) north of the Missouri state line.  Just 500 yards (460 m) from the western end, the highway crosses a BNSF Railway line.  It enters Hamburg's west side along North Street.  Iowa 333 intersects Main Street at a four-way stop; Main Street connects to Route V in Atchison County, Missouri, one mile (1.6 km) south of town.  Two blocks east of Main Street, the route turns north onto Washington Street towards US 275.  Iowa 333 passes Hamburg's Clayton Field between A and D Streets before ending at E Street.  Northbound US 275 continues north on Washington Street and southbound US 275 travels east on E Street.


== History ==
Iowa 333 was designated in 1935 as a six-mile-long (9.7 km) spur route from US 59 to Northboro.  By the end of 1936, the route had been extended east through College Springs and ended at US 71.  It absorbed Iowa 84, which ran from US 71 into College Springs.  The former Iowa 333 spur into Northboro was redesignated Iowa 343.  A few years later, Iowa 333 was extended westward to end at US 275 in Hamburg.  This westward extension was reverted in 1964.  In 1966, the turn into College Springs was removed from Iowa 333 and became the unsigned Iowa 999.  The straightened route still ended at US 71, but now only one mile (1.6 km) north of Braddyville and the Missouri state line.For four days in December 1980, Iowa 333 consisted of only one mile (1.6 km) of road in Fremont County.  On December 15, 1980, the Iowa Department of Transportation (Iowa DOT) relinquished control of the highway to Page County from the Fremont–Page county line east to US 71.  Four days later, the Iowa DOT took control of County Road J64 from I-29 west of Hamburg to US 59 and included a brief overlap with US 275; this was mostly the same section of road that had previously been a part of Iowa 333 from the late 1930s to the mid 1960s.  The mile-long section of highway east of US 59 was turned over to Fremont County in 1987.In 2002, the Road Use Tax Fund Committee, a mix of city, county, and state transportation officials, met to review and recommend changes to Iowa's public road system. The report was necessitated by increasing costs to maintain the highway system and a level of funding that was not keeping up with the rising costs.  The committee identified over 700 miles (1,100 km) of state highways, including a significant portion of Iowa 333, which could be turned over to local jurisdictions.  Most of the committee's recommendations were accepted and on July 1, 2003, and over 600 miles (970 km) of state highways were turned over to the counties or local jurisdictions.  Iowa 333 east of the eastern junction with US 275 was given back to Fremont County and became CR J64 once again.

German Afternoons,"German Afternoons is the ninth album by American folk singer and songwriter John Prine, released in 1986.


== Recording ==
German Afternoons was Prine's second release on Oh Boy Records, the independent label he formed with his manager Al Bunetta, and delves further into the country-flavored sound established on his 1984 release Aimless Love.  Like Aimless Love, German Afternoons was co-produced by Nashville veteran Jim Rooney but also features contributions from the progressive bluegrass band New Grass Revival as well as Marty Stuart, and this accounts for Prine's return to the folk-sound of his early albums on songs like ""Lulu Walls"" and ""Paradise"", the latter a rerecording of the self-penned classic which appeared on the singer's debut John Prine in 1971.  The album was recorded in Nashville.


== Composition ==
Perhaps the most significant song that appears on German Afternoons is ""The Speed of the Sound of Loneliness"", which became a concert staple and an instant classic for many Prine devotees.  Writing in Great Days: The John Prine Anthology, critic David Fricke describes the song as ""a hypnotic song of lovesick melancholia set to a simple, mid-tempo rhythm that sounded like the desolate ticking of a hall way clock.""  ""Yeah, that came out all at once,"" Prine revealed to Paul Zollo of Bluerailroad. ""From a broken relationship I was in.  I could not understand what went wrong and I had to explain to myself, and I did it through this song.  The next day I thought, Jesus, that’s beautiful.  I didn’t recognize it at the time, it was just pouring out of me.""  Prine was nearing the end of his marriage to musician Rachel Peer-Prine, who sang harmony on several German Afternoon tracks, and producer Jim Rooney recalled in his own memoir, ""John and Rachel were having a very up-and-down time of it, but the resulting songs might have been worth all the trouble.  Perhaps the best song to come out of the turmoil generated by Rachel and John’s relationship was the aptly titled ‘Speed of the Sound of Loneliness.’""   
Two songs hearken back to the singer’s roots.  Prine had ended his 1972 LP with the Carter Family song ""Diamonds in the Rough,"" and here he kicks off the album with a rollicking arrangement of A.P. Carter's ""Lulu Walls.""  Prine also covers the Leon Payne classic ""They’ll Never Take Her Love from Me,"" made famous by Hank Williams, another key influence on Prine.  The album comes full circle with a remake of ""Paradise,"" one of Prine's most famous songs that appeared on his debut album in 1971.  He later explained: ""The song over the years had turned into such a bluegrass standard...the first version of ‘Paradise,’ in order to get a fiddle part on it, we had to ask a guy from the Memphis symphony to come in and play the violin like a fiddle, and I always remember that, and I wanted to make a more of a bluegrass version of it.""In the Great Days anthology, Prine revealed that ""Bad Boy"" had been inspired by Merle Haggard and that it was ""a really proud song about guilt.  'I'm proud to be guilty, I've been a bad boy again.'  Around that time, I fell under the spell of Merle Haggard's songwriting.  There was a period there when he just seemed to be churning out some really great stuff.  He was bringing out great albums every six or eight months, and I considered ""Bad Boy"" sort of in the vein of what he was doing.""  Prine added that Willie Nelson had told him he wanted to cut ""Linda Goes To Mars"" (""I just can't imagine him doing it, although I bet it would be good,"" Prine wrote).  The song, a comic variation on ""Angel from Montgomery"", is about a woman who mentally checked out of her marriage from time to time, told from the husband's point of view.""I Just Want To Dance with You"", co-written by Prine and Roger Cook, was released in April 1998 by American country singer George Strait as the first single to his album One Step at a Time and became his 34th Number One single on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) chart.  It was also a hit for Daniel O'Donnell in 1992, reaching 20 in the UK charts.  ""Love, Love, Love,"" a different slant on romantic disconnection, was co-written with Keith Sykes, who opened for Prine at the Bitter End years before, while Rodney Crowell protégé Bill Caswell teamed up with Prine to write ""Out of Love,"" a corny tune full of references to beer commercials. Prine wrote ""If She Were You"" with his friend Steve Goodman, who had died the same year after a long battle with leukemia.  The novelty song ""Let's Talk Dirty In Hawaiian"" was rerecorded and released as a single in 1987.
Prine would later say that the album title, which People joked in its review was ""probably the worst album title in pop music history,"" was not a throwback to his own army service but rather came from a friend: ""I had this guy explain to me once that a German afternoon is like you go into town with some errands to run and stuff to do but then you run into an old buddy you haven't seen.  And you drop into a bar for just a minute and start to talk.  And next thing you know it's already evening and you've just spent a German afternoon.""


== Reception ==
German Afternoons received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Contemporary Folk Recording.  Writing for AllMusic, critic Jim Smith says of the album, ""...this is a sleepy-town stroll, featuring snappy accompaniment by the New Grass Revival."" Music critic Robert Christgau wrote, ""...this relaxed, confident album is where Prine comes out and admits he's a folkie...The songs are straightforward and homemade...""  Prine biographer Eddie Huffman opines that the LP ""was a lively, enjoyable, and well-written album by a pro hitting his stride in middle age.""

Rita Coolidge,"Rita Coolidge (born May 1, 1945) is an American recording artist. During the 1970s and 1980s, her songs were on Billboard magazine's pop, country, adult contemporary, and jazz charts, and she won two Grammy Awards with fellow musician and then-husband Kris Kristofferson. Her recordings include ""(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher,"" ""We're All Alone"", ""I'd Rather Leave While I'm in Love"",	and the theme song for the 1983 James Bond film Octopussy: ""All Time High"".


== Life and career ==


=== Early life ===
Coolidge was born in Lafayette, Tennessee. She is the daughter of Dick and Charlotte Coolidge, a minister and schoolteacher, with sisters Linda and Priscilla, and brother Raymond. She claims to be of Cherokee and Scottish ancestry. She attended Nashville's Maplewood High School and graduated from Andrew Jackson Senior High School in Jacksonville, Florida. Coolidge is a graduate of Florida State University. She is a member of Alpha Gamma Delta sorority.


=== Early career ===
After singing around Memphis (including a stint singing jingles), Coolidge was discovered by Delaney & Bonnie, who worked with her in Los Angeles. There, she became a backing singer for artists including Leon Russell, Joe Cocker, Harry Chapin, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Dave Mason, Graham Nash, and Stephen Stills. She was featured in Joe Cocker's Mad Dogs and Englishmen tour and album, singing Russell's and Bonnie Bramlett's song ""Superstar"". Coolidge did not receive songwriting credits for ""Superstar"" which later became a hit for The Carpenters.She became known as ""The Delta Lady"" and inspired Russell to write a song of the same name for her.


=== ""Layla"" ===
Coolidge also did not receive songwriting credits for the coda of the 1971 single ""Layla"" by Eric Clapton's band Derek and the Dominos. In 2016, Coolidge stated that she recorded a demo with her boyfriend, the band's drummer Jim Gordon, before they went to England to record with Clapton. Once they met with Clapton, Coolidge played the piece she composed for him and she gave him a cassette. Clapton, impressed by the piece, used it as part of the song in the ending section which she found out by hearing the song over a PA system a year later. She tried to contact Clapton, but was told by his manager Robert Stigwood, ""What are you gonna do? You're a girl. You don't have money to fight this."" She has not heard from Clapton himself but believes he is aware of the situation.
Though only Gordon has been officially credited with writing the section, the band's keyboardist Bobby Whitlock claimed: Jim took that piano melody from his ex-girlfriend, Rita Coolidge. I know because in the Delaney & Bonnie days, I lived in John Garfield's old house in the Hollywood Hills and there was a guest house with an upright piano in it. Rita and Jim were up there in the guest house and invited me to join in on writing this song with them called ""Time"". Her sister Priscilla wound up recording it with her husband, Booker T. Jones (of Booker T. & the M.G.'s). Jim took the melody from Rita's song and didn't give her credit for writing it. Her boyfriend ripped her off. 
""Time"" ended up on the 1973 album Chronicles by Booker T. and Priscilla.


=== Kris Kristofferson ===
In November 1970, she met Kris Kristofferson at the Los Angeles airport when they were both catching the same flight to Tennessee. Instead of continuing to his intended destination in Nashville, he got off in Memphis with her. The two married in 1973, had a child in 1974, and recorded several duet albums, which sold well and earned the duo a Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal in 1974 for ""From the Bottle to the Bottom"", and in 1976 for ""Lover Please"".She also had a credited role as Maria in the Sam Peckinpah directed Western film ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"" in 1973, where Kristofferson played the role of Billy the Kid.
Coolidge's greatest success on the pop charts came during 1977–1978 with four consecutive top 25 hits, remakes of Jackie Wilson's ""(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher"", Boz Scaggs's ""We're All Alone"", the Temptations' ""The Way You Do The Things You Do"", and Marcia Hines's ""You"". Coolidge and Kristofferson divorced in June 1980.


=== Later career ===
In 1992, Coolidge sang joint lead vocals with Roger Waters on the title track of his album Amused to Death.
She also was among the first hosts on VH1, a US cable network. In 2006, she recorded a standards album, And So Is Love with artwork by Clifford Bailey.


=== Walela ===
In 1997, Coolidge was one of the founding members of Walela, a Native American-inspired music trio, that also included her sister Priscilla and Priscilla's daughter Laura Satterfield. The trio released studio albums in 1997 (Walela) and 2000 (Unbearable Love), a live album and DVD (Live in Concert) in 2004 and a compilation album (The Best of Walela) in 2007.Walela means hummingbird in Cherokee. Coolidge considered this group important, not only in honoring her claimed Cherokee ancestors but also in bringing their culture to others. The trio performed at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.


=== Books ===
Her autobiography, Delta Lady: A Memoir, was published in April 2016.


== Personal life ==


=== Relationships ===
Coolidge had romantic liaisons with Stephen Stills and Graham Nash. Coolidge leaving Stills for Nash has been cited as a contributing factor behind the initial 1970 breakup of Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young. She was the ""sweet little Indian girl"" named ""Raven"" in the song ""Cowboy Movie"" on David Crosby's album If I Could Only Remember My Name.Coolidge was also involved with Leon Russell and Joe Cocker. During the Mad Dogs & Englishmen tour, Coolidge's boyfriend at the time, Jim Gordon, assaulted her, resulting in a black eye for the rest of the tour. Coolidge ended the relationship and never spoke to him again. Gordon was later diagnosed with schizophrenia and convicted of murdering his mother.Coolidge was married to Kris Kristofferson from 1973 to 1980. Their daughter and her only child, Casey Kristofferson (also a musician), was born in 1974. Their marriage deteriorated after she miscarried her second child in 1977. In her memoir, Delta Lady, Coolidge described her marriage to Kristofferson as volatile due to his alcoholism and infidelity. She revealed he was also emotionally abusive and would belittle her talent. When they divorced she did not ask him for anything. However, in 2016 Coolidge told People that she and Kristofferson still shared a bond.Coolidge married Tatsuya Suda, a world leader in computer architecture research, on June 19, 2004, in the Cook Islands. Suda, a Japanese citizen, retired in 2010 after a long tenure as a professor at the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (UC Irvine), when allegations of professional misconduct against him surfaced. Coolidge divorced Suda in 2012. In 2014, he pleaded guilty to a felony charge of receiving illegal payments. Coolidge had lived in Fallbrook, California, where she painted and exhibited her work until 2017.In 2017 Coolidge rekindled a romantic relationship with Joe Hutto, a former college boyfriend. They married in 2018 and moved back to Tallahassee.


=== Family ===
In October 2014, Coolidge's sister, Priscilla, was murdered by her husband, Michael Siebert, in a murder-suicide. The pain of that loss was exacerbated when Siebert's ashes were delivered to Rita's home and she had to dispose of them.


== Awards and nominations ==
Coolidge was inducted into the Southern Museum of Music Hall of Fame in 2015.


=== Grammy Awards ===
Coolidge has won two Grammy Awards from her three nominations.

Atlantidae,"Atlantidae is a family of sea snails, holoplanktonic gastropod molluscs in the clade Littorinimorpha.
According to taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi (2005) the family Atlantidae has no subfamilies.


== Description ==
The Atlantidae is a group of holoplanktonic gastropods, which all demonstrate a strong adaptation to pelagic life, in the form of a lenticular, laterally flattened, aragonitic shell, the surface of which is further enlarged by the presence of a wide, and very thin and fragile, double-walled keel. The apex is on the right side of the shell, the umbilicus on the left. For the living animal the enlargement of the shell's surface serves ‘to increase stabilization during swimming and sinking’. This phenomenon results in the occurrence of superficially very similar adult shells in separate species, whereas the larval shells may be utterly different.Their body size is microscopic with a shell diameter of less than 1 cm. The foot has evolved into a muscular swimming fin. Their swimming fin extends anteriorly beneath their head. They swim with their ventral part upward through undulation of their swimming fin.
The shell is coiled dextrally (i.e. clockwise). The thin, double-walled keel of the shell extends outward from the last shell whorl. The apex of the shell is found on the right side, the umbilicus on the left side. The shell and keel can be calcareous (genus Atlanta), or composed exclusively of  conchiolin (genus Oxygyrus), or the shell can be calcareous and its keel composed of conchiolin (genus Protatlanta). The snails of this family can retract into their shell and close it off with a cartilaginous, flexible operculum.


== Genera ==
Genera in the family Atlantidae include:

Atlanta Lesueur, 1817 - type genus
Oxygyrus Benson, 1835 - monospecific, it has only one species Oxygyrus keraudrenii (Lesueur, 1817)
Protatlanta Tesch, 1908  - monospecific in extant species; a few fossil species have been described
† Bellerophina d’Orbigny, 1843
† Eoatlanta Cossmann, 1888
† Mioatlanta di Geronimo, 1974Recent Atlantidae, in the present concept, comprise three genera, two of which, Oxygyrus Benson, 1835, and Protatlanta Tesch, 1908, are considered monospecific. In Protatlanta, however, a few additional fossil species have been described. Both genera are characterised by partially uncalcified (conchiolin) shell portions. Additional fossil genera considered to belong in the Atlantidae are Bellerophina d’Orbigny, 1843 (Cretaceous), Eoatlanta  Cossmann, 1888 (Paleocene-Eocene) and Mioatlanta  di Geronimo, 1974 (Miocene). Only few Atlanta species are known from the fossil record, the oldest one being Atlanta arenularia Gougerot & Braillon, 1965 is from the Bartonian of the Paris Basin, which differs considerably from typical Atlanta by its cornucopia shape.


== Ecology ==
Atlantids are negatively buoyant. During the day, they have to swim to maintain their position. At night they secrete strands of buoyant mucus to which they attach themselves. They are active predator locating their prey visually.

Notorious (ship),"Notorious is a replica fifteenth-century caravel. The ship took ten years to build, made entirely from reclaimed timber. It was launched at Martins Point, Port Fairy, Victoria, Australia, on Monday, 7 February 2011. Notorious was fitted with sails and conducted its first week-long journey from Port Fairy to Geelong in January 2012.


== Design and construction ==
Notorious is a full-size, wooden sailing ship, a re-creation of a caravel, c1500. Notorious was researched, designed, and constructed single-handedly from reclaimed timber by Graeme Wylie, at his home at Bushfield, near Warrnambool, Victoria, Australia. The ship's keelson was laid in April 2002. The keelson is an ironbark beam salvaged from the viaduct, at the Warrnambool Breakwater. The ship's frames were completed towards the end of 2003. By 2008, the ship was opened to the public at the construction site, while the planking was still being completed. The ship was launched at Martin's Point, Port Fairy, on 7 February 2011.
Notorious was constructed of reclaimed Monterey cypress (Cupressus macrocarpa) with a displacement of 58 tonnes. The ship is 17.5 metres in length overall, has a beam of 5.5 metres, and a draught of 2.1 metres. The vessel is lateen rigged, making it Australia's only operational lateen-rigged ship. The interior is an authentic period design, including a cooking fire. The ship has modern GPS navigation, a diesel engine and some other modern conveniences, all hidden behind timber panels.


== Inspiration ==
The Mahogany Ship, a shipwreck first seen by Europeans in 1836, partly buried in sand dunes between Warrnambool and Port Fairy, and last seen in 1886, was part of the inspiration for Wylie. Several writers have claimed the Mahogany Ship was a Portuguese caravel that sailed from Batavia in 1520, down the eastern Australian seaboard and into Bass Strait, before entering the Southern Ocean.
Caravels were a revolutionary design in ship evolution, being the first European vessels with a transom, with the steerboard taken to the rear of the ship. These ships were rigged with the lateen sail, borrowed from the Arabian dhow, a highly versatile and easily managed sail arrangement, allowing a degree of sailing into the wind. The caravels were small, fast, manoeuvrable, and easily handled by a small crew.


== Operational history ==
Her maiden voyage, in January 2012, was from Port Fairy, through Bass Strait, to Port Phillip Bay. Since then, Notorious has sailed over 20,000 nautical miles between the Southern Ocean, Bass Strait, the Tasman and Coral Seas. Notorious is owned and operated by Seadog Sailing Inc, visiting Queensland ports. As a museum ship, it is also open for onboard and below deck Inspection. Notorious is the only sailing caravel in the Southern Hemisphere.

Thomas Lowe (politician),"Thomas F. Lowe (January 15, 1812 – November 18, 1875) was a Georgia musician, businessman, and politician who served as the acting mayor of Atlanta, during the early part of the American Civil War.
In 1858, T. F. Lowe was elected as an alderman representing Atlanta's Second Ward. Lowe and fellow future Atlanta mayor William Ezzard were among a group of investors that chartered the Atlanta Mutual Insurance and Stock Company in 1859.
In November 1861, he took over as Atlanta's mayor after incumbent Jared Whitaker was appointed to head the commissary and logistics activities for Georgia's state troops. He was not a candidate for election to a full term, and was succeeded by James M. Calhoun. He was commissioned as a colonel in the Georgia state militia. As a violin soloist, he was a local favorite and played many recitals in Atlanta and Decatur, even during the war.Lowe died in Mount Airy, Georgia, and is buried in Atlanta's Oakland Cemetery.

Philidas,"Philidas Ltd. (previously named Infast Philidas) is a company based in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, England that manufactures nuts and components for automotive and industrial applications.


== History ==
The company was established in 1942, and is a branch of the Haden MacLellan engineering group. Prior to this the company was a part of B Elliott, which sold Philidas to Haden MacLellan in 2000. Philidas manufactures automobile fasteners in both small and large-scale batches. The company's products are distributed on a global basis. In 2005, it was reported that the company manufactures 110 million fasteners annually. Philidas had a factory on Monkhill Lane, Pontefract. But this closed in January 2014. Some of Philidas' clients include BMW, Jaguar, Ford and Bosch.


== Philidas nut ==
A Philidas nut is a locknut with one or more slots cut laterally in the reduced-diameter circular top for less than half the diameter, the metal above the slot(s) being deformed downwards so that over the last one or two turns, the thread for half the diameter is ""axially depitched"" or displaced from its normal position.  As the nut is threaded on, the displaced sections are elastically forced back axially to their original position, the load increasing the friction between the nut and the fastener, creating the locking action. These nuts retain their locking action at temperatures limited only by the base material, as no polymeric insert is used, and as the locking action is by elastic deformation, they can be re-used multiple times. They may look similar, but differ substantially from the split beam nut because the former has a radial displacement of the deformed portion, while the Philidas nut uses axial deflection or depitching.
There are at least two basic types, the original ""Industrial"" type with two slots, one on each side of the diameter but axially aligned, and the ""Turret"" where both slots are aligned radially, one above the other. The Turret type appears to reduce the risk of failure of the locking action due to fracture between the base of both slots, which may be a limitation of the Industrial type.
Philidas, the original and current manufacturer, is a tradename for these nuts, which were patented in 1942.

Lawrence Sirovich,"Lawrence Sirovich is mathematical scientist whose research includes, among other topics, applied mathematics, neuroscience and physics. He is recognized as the pioneer behind modern face recognition, and is known for eigenfaces, the method of snapshots, low dimensional dynamical systems, analysis of the US Supreme Court, neuronal population dynamics, and the faithful copy neuron.


== Early life and education ==
Sirovich was born to Jewish immigrants from Poland and raised in Brownsville, a working-class immigrant neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. He gained entrance to the Brooklyn Technical H.S., an experience which first opened his eyes to the possibilities of the world. There he was captain of the math team and years later, in 2018, inducted into the BTHS Hall of Fame. Sirovich attended Johns Hopkins University as an undergraduate math major, and as a graduate student in aeronautical engineering (where applied mathematics was practiced). In 1958, jointly with Johns Hopkins University, he became a research assistant at the Courant Institute at NYU. It was there that he wrote his PhD dissertation ""On the Kinetic Theory of Steady Gas Flows"" in 1960.  At the Courant Institute, K.O. Friedrichs, a mathematician of great insight and taste, was his most influential teacher. For Sirovich, taking a course with Friedrichs on asymptotics was a life-changing experience. Another early mentor at the Courant Institute was Fritz John, a mathematician of the highest character with whom Sirovich later started the eminent Applied Mathematical Sciences series, of Springer-Verlag Publishing.


== Research ==
Sirovich's early research was in kinetic theory, its connection with fluid mechanics, and such areas of fluid mechanics as supersonic flow and turbulence. A turning point in Sirovich's research came with his reading of Jim Watson's The Double Helix, which caused Sirovich to realize that he was not engaged in the heroic research of his time. This prompted participation in a Cold Spring Harbor summer course on biology, and eventually led to his close association with H. Keffer Hartline's Laboratory of Biophysics at the Rockefeller University, and a long collaboration with Bruce W. Knight, the present head of the laboratory. As a maturing scientist, Sirovich's research interests took on an element of serendipity (""chance confers an advantage on the prepared mind"", Louis Pasteur). For example, a chance remark on the failure of the standard description of the horseshoe crab's lateral eye neural network at its boundaries led to a Weiner-Hopf solution to the problem, with complete experimental agreement. An article by Linda Greenhouse in the New York Times led to ""A pattern analysis of the second Rehnquist U.S. Supreme Court."" An observation that human faces, are always different, but are always recognizable as a face; and likewise that images of turbulence had the same property of being different, and being recognizable as turbulence led to a successful model of face recognition, and also served as an analysis model for turbulence. The former led to Sirovich's establishing the subject of face recognition. Allied to this was the notion of low dimensional dynamical descriptions of turbulence in standard geometrical settings.  In a series of three papers on the subject, Sirovich established the field of low dimensional dynamical models.According to Google Scholar, Lawrence Sirovich has ~250 publications, which have been cited nearly 30,000 times.


== Personal life ==
Sirovich met Carole Hochman, a number theorist, at the Courant Institute. Their first date took place on September 4, 1960 and they married October 16th, 1960. Carole received her PhD from the Courant Institute and later became Chair of the Department of Math and Science at the Pratt Institute, which she retired from in 2017.Their daughter Brenda Sirovich was born in 1963, and received a B.A. in math and biology from Harvard. She is the co-director of the VA Outcomes Group at Dartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine.  Their son Matthew was born in 1966. Matt studied math and economics at Brown University, and is currently a board member there.In 2018 Mathew Sirovich honored his parents by endowing the Carole & Lawrence Sirovich Chair of Public Health at Brown University.

Domingo Ortiz,"Domingo Steven ""Sunny"" Ortiz (born  July 4, 1952) is an American musician best known as the longtime percussionist for Widespread Panic.


== Life and career ==
Domingo Ortiz was born in 1952 to Victor and Faye Ortiz. He is of Mexican heritage and grew up in Waco, Texas. With his parents' help, he bought his first drum kit as a teenager. He played his first professional gig at the age of 15 in the 1960s at a bar with his Uncle Cruz's band. His parents were initially against the idea of him performing with a rock band but came around to the idea when they learned he would be paid $35 for the performance.Ortiz began his career on a standard drum set, but shifted to bongos, congas, timbales and other percussion instruments as a way to distinguish himself from other drummers in Texas. In 1986 he moved to Athens, Georgia where he met up with the members of the newly formed Widespread Panic. Playing percussion, he performed with them for the first time on October 6, 1986. He continued to sit in with them regularly when they played in Georgia for the next couple of years before accepting their formal offer to join the band in late 1988 or early 1989. He has performed with them at every concert they have played since then. He has also appeared on every album they have recorded including their debut, Space Wrangler, which was recorded shortly before he officially joined the band.Unlike most of his band mates, Ortiz has not performed with many other groups professionally since joining the band. He did, however, perform on the late Widespread Panic guitarist Michael Houser's debut solo album Door Harp and current Widespread Panic keyboardist John Hermann's debut solo album Smiling Assassin. He was not a member of brute., a band active from 1995 to 2002 that included all of the other members of Widespread Panic and Vic Chesnutt, but he did perform on their second album Co-Balt.

Kansas's 4th congressional district,"Kansas's 4th congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of Kansas. Based in the south central part of the state, the district encompasses the city of Wichita, the largest city in Kansas, three universities, Arkansas City, and the State of Kansas's only national airport.
The 4th congressional district is historically a strongly Republican district, almost exclusively represented, over the last half century, by Republicans—with the sole exception of moderate Democrat Dan Glickman, who lost his bid for re-election to a 10th term in 1994.As of mid-April 2017 (following a special election to fill the district seat left vacant by Mike Pompeo's resignation to become CIA Director), no other Democrat has won election to the Congressional seat lost by Glickman, which has since gone to conservative, anti-abortion Republicans, routinely, by a roughly two-to-one margin in subsequent races—with the exception of the April 11, 2017 special election, in which Democrat James Thompson managed to narrow the gap with Republican victor Ron Estes to only 6.2%.


== History ==
Since the 1980s (and peaking with the 1991 Summer of Mercy protests), the district's major city, Wichita (where most 4th district voters reside), is often referred to in national media as the center, or ""ground zero"", of the nation's anti-abortion movement—a primary factor that Glickman has credited for his defeat,—and which has remained a major influence in 4th district politics, with all three of Glickman's successors (Todd Tiahrt, Mike Pompeo and Ron Estes) claiming strong anti-abortion views.  In the 2017 Special Election to fill Pompeo's vacated seat, a critical factor in Estes' unusually narrow victory over the Democrat (James Thompson) was a string of last-minute ads tying Thompson to his pro-abortion stance.


=== Redistricting ===
In 2012, a feud between conservative and moderate Republicans in the Kansas Legislature stymied progress on mandatory decennial redistricting (boundary changes to reflect new demographic data from the decennial census). With elections approaching, the federal courts intervened and drew the district boundaries, shifting the fourth district westward, into more conservative territory.


=== 2016 elections ===
In the 2016 general election, incumbent Republican Mike Pompeo was overwhelmingly re-elected to the seat, with a 31% (85,000-vote) lead over his Democratic rival. However, President-elect Donald Trump then nominated him as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and upon Pompeo's Congressional confirmation as CIA Director in January 2017, Pompeo resigned his Congressional seat, leaving it vacant—forcing Kansas Governor Sam Brownback to call a special election, set for April 11, 2017, to fill Pompeo's vacated Congressional seat. (as happened with Pompeo's previous Democratic challengers).


=== 2017 special election ===
Kansas Governor Sam Brownback, acting on his authority, announced a special election would be held on April 11, 2017, to fill the vacancy left by Rep. Pompeo's resignation.  Republican, Democratic, and Libertarian parties would select their nominees through district caucuses, run by the respective party organizations, voting through delegates selected by their respective party rules. It would be the first Congressional election since the 2016 national election, and thus drew national attention.Republicans nominated Kansas State Treasurer Ron Estes. Democrats nominated civil-rights attorney James Thompson, a political novice. Libertarians nominated aviation instructor Chris Rockhold, also a political novice.Initial assumptions were that this election's outcome was a foregone conclusion: The Republican would win overwhelmingly again.  However, Democratic nominee Thompson, aided with numerous energetic supporters (particularly former local campaigners for Bernie Sanders, who had taken the 2016 Kansas Democratic Presidential Caucus by 75%), began to show signs of the first serious fourth district challenge to Republicans since Glickman's loss a quarter-century earlier.The Thompson campaign raised about $254,000 by the final campaign finance-reporting deadline, and over 97% was from individual donors—with a last-minute infusion of only $10,000 from the state party, reflecting a lack of support from his state party and national organizations. By comparison, Estes raised about $318,000—plus another $94,000 from the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) after the filing deadline—largely from outside groups and big (over $1,000) donors.The Thompson campaign emphasized Thompson's working-class progressive credentials, telling the story of his childhood poverty and use of education as a ladder to opportunity. Another key focus was his status as a U.S. Army veteran and advocacy for Second Amendment rights, featuring images of him firing his assault rifle. The campaign strongly emphasized his desire to defend the Constitution, inferring a reference to President Trump. The Thompson campaign attempted to focus public attention on Estes' close connections to exceptionally unpopular Governor Sam Brownback. In response, Estes and the Republican party simply branded Thompson as ""too liberal for Kansas."" Estes' low-key campaign included refusing to attend several debates with Thompson and Libertarian candidate Rockhold. However, last-minute Republican ads—with retouched photos—depicted Thompson with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and focused on Thompson's abortion-rights beliefs (rather falsely, Thompson and some others argued, but essentially accurate, others have said), with apparent impact.In the last two weeks of the election, Republicans responded with a flurry of ads, especially abortion-focused ads, largely from national Republican party organizations. Robo-calls from President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence flooded the fourth district, and Senator Ted Cruz—who had won the 2016 Kansas Republican presidential caucus—made a last-minute visit to the district to stump for Estes.On election day—although advance voting returns indicated a substantial lead for Thompson, and Thompson narrowly secured a majority of the total Sedgwick County vote—a final tally of the in-person votes, combined with the advance ballots, eventually sorted out to give Estes (at 53% of the vote) the victory over Democrat Thompson (with 45% - about 8,500 fewer votes) and Libertarian Rockhold (at 2%, about 1,900 votes total). It was the closest that Democrats had come to retaking the seat since Glickman's 1994 loss, and though clearly the Republican won, analysts described the unusually close race as a sign of trouble for Republicans in the fourth district, and in Kansas, and nationally. Thompson immediately announced plans to run for the seat, again, in 2018.


=== 2018 regular election ===
In the 2018 election, the district's Republican incumbent for Congress was Representative Ron Estes.  He was challenged in the primaries by a candidate with a similar name, Ron M. Estes. This led to a conundrum as to how the candidates should be distinguished on the ballot, with Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach claiming that Ron G. Estes can include the prefix ""Rep."" on the ballot according to Kansas law, although Ron M. Estes claimed that this was unfair. Ron G. Estes, the incumbent, won the primary with more than 80% of the vote. In the Democratic primary for Congress, Laura Lombard lost to James Thompson, who was defeated by Ron G. Estes in the 2017 special election. In the general election, Ron Estes was re-elected, defeating James Thompson by a large margin.


=== 2000 demographics ===
Most of the approximately 670,000 citizens of the fourth district reside in the state's largest city, Wichita (approximate population 390,000), or the surrounding Sedgwick County (approximate population 511,000).

== Historical district boundaries ==
In 2012, in an unusual move, the federal courts intervened in Kansas's decennial redistricting (required by law to adjust boundaries of Congressional and state legislative districts every 10 years, to reflect changing population distributions, as reported by the decennial census).Sharply criticizing the Legislature for the intractable feud between conservative and moderate factions in the Kansas Legislature (normally responsible for redistricting), and recognizing the rapidly approaching next elections, a federal three-judge panel (the Chief Justice of the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals and two judges from the Kansas City U.S. District Court) drew the Kansas state and Congressional district boundaries themselves, in rather simple and direct shapes that produced radical changes.In the process, the 4th congressional district shifted west—still centered approximately on (and demographically dominated by) Wichita, The district's previous eastern boundary – Montgomery County and part of Greenwood County – were moved into another district, while the 4th district's western edge moved farther west, to include all of Pratt, Stafford, Barber, Kiowa, Comanche and Edwards counties, plus a slender section of southern Pawnee County. In the process, the Fourth acquired a more neatly rectangular shape, and sharply reduced the amount of counties divided between the Fourth and another district.The map shown here indicates prior boundaries.

Carson City Mint,"The Carson City Mint was a branch of the United States Mint in Carson City, Nevada. It primarily minted silver coins; however, it also minted gold coins, with a total face value in dollars nearly equal to that of its silver coins. The mint minted coins in 21 different years.
The Carson City Mint was created in 1863 but was not put into operation until 1870. It ran until 1885, went on a hiatus, and resumed operations in 1889, after which it ran until 1893, when it closed permanently. It is now the Nevada State Museum, Carson City.


== History ==
Built at the peak of the silver boom conveniently near a local silver mine, 50 issues of silver coins and 57 issues of gold coins minted here between 1870 and 1893 bore the ""CC"" mint mark. The mint was established in Carson City to facilitate minting of silver coins from silver in the Comstock Lode, much as the San Francisco Mint was established to facilitate minting gold coins from the gold of the California gold rush. From 1895 to 1933, the building served as the U.S. Assay Office for gold and silver. The federal government sold the building to the state of Nevada in 1939. Coins struck here, especially Morgan dollars, are generally rare and command a high premium among collectors.
The building that housed the mint was the first designed by Alfred B. Mullett after becoming Supervising Architect of the Department of the Treasury. The construction supervisor was Abraham Curry, also known as the ""Father of Carson City."" The simple Renaissance Revival-style stone facade has pairs of round-headed windows and a center portico. It is now the home of the Nevada State Museum. Although the mint has not struck United States coins since 1893, Coin Press No. 1 (the original coin press from the mint) is still in the building and used to strike commemorative medallions with the ""CC"" mint mark. The most recent of these are medallions commemorating the 75th anniversary of the museum.


=== Proposed commemorative coin production ===
On July 16, 2019, a bill was introduced proposing to strike commemorative Morgan and Peace dollars on the premises of the Nevada State Museum in 2021.  If passed, the coins will feature the ""CC"" mint mark, becoming the first legal tender coins to do so in 128 years.  Aside from adding a new date to both the Morgan and Peace dollar series, it would be the first time the Peace dollar is struck with the mint mark.
The bill has received support from many coin collectors, with the American Numismatic Association encouraging collectors to express their support.  However, some collectors have voiced their concerns about the mintage limit of 500,000 pieces.Though 2021 Morgan commemorative dollars were struck with a 'CC' privy mark, they were not struck at the former Carson City Mint.


== Denominations minted ==


=== Silver denominations ===
Seated Liberty dime (1871–1878)
Twenty-cent piece (1875–76)
Seated Liberty quarter (1870–1878)

Crinkle-cutting,"Crinkle-cutting is slicing that leaves a corrugated surface. It can be done to enhance the texture or mechanical properties of food. Crinkle-cutting French fries may improve their crispiness, as well as their ability to retain dipping sauce.


== Waffle fries ==
Pommes gaufrettes, grid fries, waffle fries, crinkle-cut or criss-cross fries are fries obtained by quarter-turning the potato before each pass over the corrugated blade of a mandoline and deep-frying.  This increases the surface area relative to the volume, exposing a larger area to the cooking process and allowing more water vapor to escape, resulting in a product that is crisper, and perhaps tastier as more of it is subject to the browning and flavor-producing effects of the Maillard reaction which takes place during cooking.

Affleck–Dine mechanism,"The Affleck–Dine mechanism (AD mechanism) is a postulated mechanism for explaining baryogenesis during the primordial Universe immediately following the Big Bang. Thus, the AD mechanism may explain the asymmetry between matter and antimatter in the current Universe. It was proposed in 1985 by Ian Affleck and Michael Dine of Princeton University.In the supersymmetry theory of particle physics, ordinary quarks and leptons have scalar partners that carry baryon and lepton numbers. As the latter decay into fermions during the early Universe, the net baryon number that they carry can then form the currently observed excess of ordinary baryons. This occurs due to interactions of the scalars with the inflaton field, resulting in CP violations.The AD mechanism must have occurred during or after the reheating event that followed cosmic inflation. This may explain why the net mass of normal matter and dark matter are apparently so close to each other, rather than being widely different.

The Boat Race 1875,"The 32nd Boat Race between crews from the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge took place on the River Thames on 20 March 1875. The Cambridge crew contained four Blues to Oxford's two, the latter went into the race without a win since the 1869 race.  In a race umpired by Joseph William Chitty, Oxford won by ten lengths in a time of 22 minutes 2 seconds, taking the overall record in the event to 17–15 in their favour.  One of the Cambridge crew broke his slide during the race.


== Background ==
The Boat Race is a side-by-side rowing competition between the University of Oxford (sometimes referred to as the ""Dark Blues"") and the University of Cambridge (sometimes referred to as the ""Light Blues"").  The race was first held in 1829, and since 1845 has taken place on the 4.2-mile (6.8 km) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London.  Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions, having defeated Oxford by 3+1⁄2 lengths in the previous year's race, while Oxford led overall with sixteen wins to Cambridge's fifteen.Cambridge were coached by John Goldie, the Cambridge boat club president and rower for the 1869, 1870 and 1871 races, and Charles Stokes Read who had rowed for Cambridge in the previous three races.  Oxford's coaches were S. D. Darbishire who had rowed for the Dark Blues in the 1868, 1869 and 1870 races, F. H. Hall who had coxed for three races between 1870 and 1872, Robert Wells Risley who had rowed four times between the 1857 and 1860 races, Edmund Warre (represented Oxford in 1857 and 1858), Frank Willan (four-time winning rower between 1866 and 1869) and Walter Bradford Woodgate who had rowed in the 1862 and 1863 races. Joseph William Chitty was the umpire for the race.  He had rowed for Oxford twice in 1849 (in March and December) and the 1852 race.  The starter was Edward Searle.


== Crews ==
The Oxford crew weighed an average of 11 st 12.375 lb (75.3 kg), 1.625 pounds (0.7 kg) more than their opponents.  Cambridge's crew contained four former Blues, including Herbert Edward Rhodes who was making his third appearance in the race.  Oxford saw two rowers return from the 1874 race, in H. J. Stayner and J. P. Way.  According to Drinkwater, the Oxford University Boat Club towards the end of 1874 produced a ""fine crew"", and of particular note was the inclusion of the former Eton Captain of the Boats Tom Edwards-Moss.  In contrast, Cambridge's crew, with just two returning from the previous year's race, was completed with ""material ... not of a very high order"".


== Race ==
Oxford were considered clear pre-race favourites to win their first Boat Race in five years; conditions were inclement with a ""nasty north-west wind"" but a ""fair tide"".  They lost the toss and Cambridge elected to start from the Middlesex station, handing Oxford the Surrey side of the river.  The race commenced at 1:13 p.m., and Cambridge made the better start, taking the lead from the outset with a higher stroke rate.  Half a length ahead after a minute, the Light Blues nearly had a clear water advantage but tired in the strong headwind, and started to be caught by Craven Steps, around 1,000 yards (910 m) along the course. About a mile into the race, one of the Cambridge crew broke a slide.The crews were level at the Crab Tree pub and by Hammersmith Bridge, and with the advantage of the bend in the river, Oxford were clear and went on to win by ten lengths in a time of 22 minutes 2 seconds.  It was their first victory since 1869 and took the overall record in the event to 17–15 in their favour.

After releasing two singles on their own Goliath label, they moved to London and signed to their manager Dave Bedford's Fire Records, with Forgie being replaced by future The House of Love/Levitation guitarist Terry Bickers. After an EP on Fire Records (Hallelujah Chorus and Other Coyote Yelps) and a subsequent LP, Bickers departed to join The House of Love, to be replaced by John Watt (previously of Kissed Air and currently composer for BBC's Dragons' Den). Wakeman also left, his replacement being ex-Big Self drummer Owen Howell.

Caladenia pendens subsp. pendens,"Caladenia pendens subsp. pendens, commonly known as the pendant spider orchid, is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It has a single hairy leaf and up to three relatively large, creamy-white flowers with long drooping petals and sepals and sometimes has a sickly-sweet scent.


== Description ==
Caladenia pendens subsp. pendens is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf, 80–130 mm (3–5 in) long and about 5 mm (0.2 in) wide. Up to three creamy-white flowers 120–180 mm (5–7 in) long and 100–160 mm (4–6 in) wide are borne on a spike 150–300 mm (6–10 in) tall. The sepals and petals have long, brown, drooping, thread-like tips. The dorsal sepal is erect, 60–120 mm (2–5 in) long and 2–3 mm (0.08–0.1 in) wide. The lateral sepals are 60–120 mm (2–5 in) long and 3–5 mm (0.1–0.2 in) wide, turned downwards near their bases but then drooping. The petals are 80–120 mm (3–5 in) long and 3–4 mm (0.1–0.2 in) wide, spreading horizontally near their bases then drooping. The labellum is 15–19 mm (0.6–0.7 in) long, 9–12 mm (0.4–0.5 in) wide and creamy-white with red lines and spots. The sides of the labellum curve upwards and have short blunt teeth on their sides and the tip of the labellum curves downwards. There are two rows of cream-coloured, anvil-shaped calli along the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs from August to early October.


== Taxonomy and naming ==
Caladenia pendens was first described in 2001 by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Phillip Brown and the description was published in Nuytsia. At the same time they described two subspecies, including subspecies pendens. The specific epithet (pendens) is a Latin word meaning ""hanging"" referring to the long drooping petals and lateral sepals.


== Distribution and habitat ==
The pendant spider orchid is found between Wongan Hills and Walpole in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest, Mallee, Swan Coastal Plain and Warren biogeographic regions. It grows in sandy soil near salt lakes and on granite outcrops.


== Conservation ==
Caladenia pendens subsp. pendens  is classified as ""not threatened"" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

Naiad,"In Greek mythology, the naiads (; Greek: ναϊάδες, translit. naïádes) are a type of female spirit, or nymph, presiding over fountains, wells, springs, streams, brooks and other bodies of fresh water.
They are distinct from river gods, who embodied rivers, and the very ancient spirits that inhabited the still waters of marshes, ponds and lagoon-lakes such as pre-Mycenaean Lerna in the Argolis.


== Etymology ==
The Greek word is ναϊάς (naïás [naːiás]), plural ναϊάδες (naïádes [naːiádes]). It derives from νάειν (náein), ""to flow"", or νᾶμα (nâma), ""running water"".


== Mythology ==
Naiads were often the object of archaic local cults, worshipped as essential to humans. Boys and girls at coming-of-age ceremonies dedicated their childish locks to the local naiad of the spring. In places like Lerna their waters' ritual cleansings were credited with magical medical properties. Animals were ritually drowned there. Oracles might be situated by ancient springs.
Naiads could be dangerous: Hylas of the Argo’s crew was lost when he was taken by naiads fascinated by his beauty. The naiads were also known to exhibit jealous tendencies. Theocritus's story of naiad jealousy was that of a shepherd, Daphnis, who was the lover of Nomia or Echenais; Daphnis had on several occasions been unfaithful to Nomia and as revenge she permanently blinded him. The nymph Salmacis raped Hermaphroditus and fused with him when he tried to escape.
The water nymph associated with particular springs was known all through Europe in places with no direct connection with Greece, surviving in the Celtic wells of northwest Europe that have been rededicated to Saints, and in the medieval Melusine.
Walter Burkert points out, ""When in the Iliad [xx.4–9] Zeus calls the gods into assembly on Mount Olympus, it is not only the well-known Olympians who come along, but also all the nymphs and all the rivers; Okeanos alone remains at his station"", Greek hearers recognized this impossibility as the poet's hyperbole, which proclaimed the universal power of Zeus over the ancient natural world: ""the worship of these deities,"" Burkert confirms, ""is limited only by the fact that they are inseparably identified with a specific locality.""


== Interpretation ==
Robert Graves offered a sociopolitical reading of the common myth-type in which a mythic king is credited with marrying a naiad and founding a city: it was the newly arrived Hellenes justifying their presence. The loves and rapes of Zeus, according to Graves' readings, record the supplanting of ancient local cults by Olympian ones (Graves 1955, passim).
So, in the back-story of the myth of Aristaeus, Hypseus, a king of the Lapiths, married Chlidanope, a naiad, who bore him Cyrene. Aristaeus had more than ordinary mortal experience with the naiads: when his bees died in Thessaly, he went to consult them. His aunt Arethusa invited him below the water's surface, where he was washed with water from a perpetual spring and given advice.


== Types and individual names ==


== Place names ==
St. Charles Avenue in New Orleans was formerly known as Nyades Street, and is parallel to Dryades Street.
Naiad Lake in Antarctica is named after the nymphs.

Manuel Romero Rubio,"Manuel Romero Rubio (Mexico City, March 7, 1828 – Mexico City, October 3, 1895), was a Mexican politician and lawyer who participated in the governments of Benito Juárez, Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada and Porfirio Díaz.


== Education as a lawyer and the beginning of his political career ==
Manuel Romero Rubio began his education at the Conciliar Seminary in Mexico City, where he acquired knowledge of Latin grammar and philosophy. Later, at the Colegio de San Gregorio he began his studies in law. In there, he was recognized as one of the most distinguished students and became friends with Lerdo de Tejada, among other colleagues who later acquired highly relevant roles in the national political sphere.At the Colegio de San Gregorio, due to his brilliant participation in the discussions of the Academy of Jurisprudence, Romero Rubio received various offers to occupy positions in the government; however, he did not accept these invitations, preferring to finish his studies.The Colegio de San Gregorio –considered as a center of independent thought–, underwent government scrutiny and was closed briefly under the return of Santa Anna on October 20, 1853. For this reason, Manuel Romero Rubio and Ignacio Mariscal, among other students, became the main organizers of the Club Político el Águila, which emerged as a protest, and which was joined by several figures who later occupied high positions in Mexican politics.On January 11, 1854, Romero Rubio obtained his law degree from the Colegio de San Gregorio, and enrolled before the National Association Bar with the financial support of José Urbano Fonseca Martínez.That same year, he opened his own law firm, which was one of the most prominent in the capital, and attended by figures from various political positions.


== Participation in the Plan of Ayutla ==
In 1854, being 26 years old, Manuel Romero Rubio joined the Plan of Ayutla, aimed at removing conservative, centralist President Santa Anna government and, with Miguel Buenrostro, he held a first meeting with Benito Juárez as the representative of the Liberal clubs in Mexico City.After the triumph of the Plan of Ayutla, Romero Rubio was appointed magistrate of the first instance in the court of Tulancingo, Hidalgo. Two months later, he declined the position and returned to the capital to serve as secretary of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation and, later, as advisor to Colonel Agustín Alcerreca, governor of the Federal District.


== Romero Rubio Constituent and the Reform War ==
After Santa Anna's resignation in 1855 by the Ayutla Revolution, the Constituent Congress of 1856-1857 was established, where Manuel Romero Rubio – without having proposed a candidacy – was elected alternate deputy by the State of Mexico thanks to his excellent reputation  as a magistrate in the Tulancingo court.As member of the Constituent Congress, his votes in favor of the confiscation of the assets of the clergy, and the dissolution of the Society of Jesus –which had been reestablished in Mexico during the dictatorship of Santa Anna– are specially relevant.His interventions in the Constituent Congress positioned Romero Rubio as a liberal politician and, in September 1857, he held the position of Secretary of the Interior of the Federal District during the government of Ignacio Comonfort. However, in December 1857 he resigned his position due to the addition of Juan José Baz  –Governor of the Federal District–  to the Plan of Tacubaya; whose main objective was to reject the Constitution of 1857.At the end of March 1858, the new conservative government of Félix María Zuloaga apprehended Romero Rubio, Riva Palacio and other liberals who were transferred to the dungeons of the ex-Acordada, from where they corresponded with their allies, to stay informed about the events of the Reform War.On November 20, 1858, when he was released along with the rest of the ex-Accorda political prisoners, Manuel Romero Rubio was appointed head of the Huastecas forces of the liberal army, and joined the front of General Juan J. de la Garza in Tamaulipas, who named him second in command of his division.However, Romero Rubio remained at the head of the division when De la Garza was wounded after a confrontation with conservative forces in Corcovada; moment when Manuel Romero Rubio directed his troops to San Luis Potosí, where he met with other liberal leaders and was commissioned to meet with Benito Juárez in Veracruz, with the purpose of convincing him about the great need to speed up the declaration of the Reform laws, whose project had been postponed due to the country's political instability.Finally, in July 1859, Juárez announced the Reform laws, and Romero Rubio returned to Tamaulipas, from where he organized his division to confront conservative groups that opposed the new Constitution.


== Participation in the government of Benito Juárez ==
Romero Rubio was involved in the Battle of Calpulapan, the last military confrontation of the Reform War.With the victory of the liberal army in the Reform War, Benito Juárez established his government in Mexico City, and Romero Rubio was appointed to reorganize custom clearance and the government of the Federal District; later he served as president of the Congress and representative deputy of the State of Mexico.


== The French intervention and his support for Juárez ==
During the French intervention in 1863, Juárez left Mexico City leaving General de la Garza in charge of the organization of the military affairs of the capital, and Romero Rubio of the civil affairs. In July of that year, Manuel Romero Rubio was briefly imprisoned in the capital and later fled to Tula, Tamaulipas.The political instability generated by the French intervention caused fractures in the liberal groups, and Romero Rubio joined Jesús González Ortega, who questioned the excessive extension of Juárez's mandate; however, these disagreements did not prevent Manuel Romero Rubio from supporting Juárez during the war against Maximiliano de Habsburgo, gathering in 1867 a significant amount of economic resources to finance his army.


== The restored Republic: collaboration with the Juárez government ==
At the conclusion of the Reform War and despite its victory, the liberal party was divided. Juárez's intentions to extend his mandate further distanced the liberal groups and three main factions emerged: the Juaristas who supported the presidency of Benito Juárez, the Porfiristas who were on the side of Porfirio Díaz, and the Lerdistas who opted for leadership by Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada. In this context, the figure of Manuel Romero Rubio stood out for his ability to negotiate, and became a reference of intellectual and political unit. Despite belonging to the Lerdistas group, with the Juaristas victory in the elections of 1867, Romero Rubio was named President of the Chamber of Deputies in 1870, and his house was consolidated as one of the most important political meeting places of the time.During the Juárez government, Romero Rubio was also named Supernumerary Magistrate of the Supreme Court, and deputy for the state of Chihuahua.


== Collaboration with the government of Lerdo de Tejada ==
In 1872, when Benito Juárez died, Lerdo de Tejada assumed the presidency initially on an temporary basis and, later, as elected president for the 1872–1876 term. In 1876, Lerdo was declared again elected president by the Legislative Branch and Manuel Romero Rubio was appointed Minister of State and Foreign Relations. However, the reelection of Lerdo de Tejada and the accusations of electoral fraud produced many disagreements that led to the armed uprising of the Porfirista group.On November 21, 1876, with the military victory of Porfirio Díaz, Lerdo de Tejada and his cabinet –including Manuel Romero Rubio and Mariano Escobedo– went into exile in the U.S.


== Political estrangement between Romero Rubio and Lerdo de Tejada ==
The political rupture between Manuel Romero Rubio and Lerdo de Tejada began to forge before the Lerdismo fall in Mexico, due to the fact that although Romero Rubio had a career and was the main advisor of Lerdo de Tejada, the latter did not grant him an active position in his cabinet until the end, when he was appointed Secretary of Foreign Relations in 1876; that is to say, the same year that the armed uprising broke out to avoid the reelection of Lerdo de Tejada.The popularity of Lerdo de Tejada waned not only before figures like Romero Rubio, but before other political agents who criticized him harshly for not listening neither respecting the ideas of others.Some of the criticisms that Romero Rubio expressed about Lerdo before belonging to the Porfirian government was his obstinacy in only including Juarista's politicians in high positions in the public administration, which in his opinion produced the political fissure that allowed the Porfiristas to gain power in the political sphere.In 1877, Romero Rubio returned to Mexico with the intention of negotiating a ""peaceful campaign in favor of constitutional restoration"", and landed in Veracruz on June 14, 1878; that is, two months after the U.S. government recognized the Diaz government as legitimate. Upon arriving to Mexico, he publicly declared his estrangement from Lerdo de Tejada.


== Romero Rubio and the consolidation of the Porfiriato ==
Upon the arrival in Mexico of Manuel Romero Rubio in 1878, the government of Porfirio Díaz had not yet consolidated its national political dominance. To achieve this, Díaz would need not only the support of his former comrades in arms, but stronger leadership that would ensure his future reelection, and that would integrate the different liberal factions that were in dispute.Manuel Romero Rubio's presence in the country served to unify the different voices of the liberal party, and create a peace agreement that would give stability to the new government, which included not only Romero Rubio among its ranks, but also many other former Lerdist personalities.Romero Rubio was recognized for his extraordinary ability to negotiate, so his adherence to the Porfirian project offered the possibility of legitimizing the government of Díaz by nullifying one of the main axes of dissent and allowing him a strategic alliance that gave him the backing of a experienced circle of Mexican politicians and intellectuals.This pact between Díaz and the remnants of the Lerdismo was reflected in 1881 with the marriage between Carmen Romero Rubio Castelló –daughter of Manuel Romero Rubio– and Porfirio Díaz.


== Secretariat of the Interior: functions and contributions ==
After the 1884 elections, Romero Rubio was appointed Secretary General of the Interior by General Díaz; position that he held until his death.The competences of the Secretary of the Interior under the leadership of Manuel Romero Rubio covered a wide range of powers that, due to their enormous social and political weight, were essential for the constitution of the Porfirian hegemony.The core of the functions of the Secretary was to guarantee public tranquility, which implied its participation in various essential issues for the functioning of the state:Monitor compliance with the Constitution. To achieve this, so the Secretary of the Interior maintained powers to request to the Congress of the Union the partial or total suspension of constitutional guarantees in cases of hazard of public peace, as well as the power to promote before the Chamber of deputies law initiatives and constitutional reforms, which allowed in 1887 the reelection of Díaz.Intermediation in the relations between the capital with the Congress of the Union and the States of Mexico – untouched powers throughout the period in which Romero Rubio was in charge of the Secretary of the Interior.Monitoring the legitimacy of the electoral elections, an essential issue to maintain the Díaz regime. As part of this function, the Secretariat of the Interior was also in charge of the postal service in the management of Romero Rubio, since the establishment of the electoral consensus required good communications between the capital and the States of Mexico. As can be seen, it's intermediation between the capital and the federal entities gave this Secretariat an essential role during the Porfiriato regime, which could not have continued without this political consensus.Monitoring of freedom of the press; In this case, the Secretariat also monitored the movements of the press in Mexico, not always in favor of freedom of expression.Coercive instruments. The Secretariat of the Interior had coercive instruments to maintain public tranquility. One of them was the National Guard of the Federal District and the Territory of Baja California; the Rural Police of the Federation – originally created to protect the main commercial routes that led to Mexico City.The administration and surveillance of hospitals, public charities, pawnshops, piety mountains, lotteries, prisons, jails, penitentiaries, etc., the care of public health and the prevention of epidemics –of utmost importance in the 19th century– , the administration of ""theaters and public entertainment"", among others.As for financial matters, one of the initiatives of Manuel Romero Rubio was the reduction of public spending by this Secretariat, which, despite its immense relevance, received a lower budget than ministries like the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit.The success of Manuel Romero Rubio's policies was recognized by his contemporaries, and helped him position himself as a fundamental element within the heterogeneous Porfirian cabinet, thanks to his immense capacity for negotiation and conciliation, becoming for this reason the right hand of Porfirio Díaz.


== Romero Rubio, the Liberal Union and the Scientists ==
As Minister of the Interior, Manuel Romero Rubio founded the Liberal Union group in 1892 with the aim of consolidating it as a political party, although it never fully became one. The Liberal Union was part of a broader plan that sought to give Diaz's reelection apparently liberal and democratic foundations. With a manifesto written by Justo Sierra, multiple calls for parades and demonstrations in favor of Díaz, and the creation of Porfirista clubs throughout the country, the Liberal Union managed to successfully attract all kinds of social and political strata that adhered to its cause. With this impressive maneuver, Romero Rubio managed to transform the political environment –which did not originally favor Díaz–, and consolidate him before public opinion as the only figure capable of continuing the progressive project and maintaining the country's stability.The group that headed the Liberal Union formed the basis of what would later become known as the Científicos, a select intellectual and political circle close to the power. Manuel Romero Rubio was the leader and protector of the Científicos until his death, when he inherited his legacy to his political protégé, the young Secretary of the Treasury, José Yves Limantour.Romero Rubio's death occurred on October 3, 1895, in Mexico City and was an event of national importance that shook the country's political class. All public buildings, including la Villa de Guadalupe, dressed in mourning, while schools, social clubs, and businesses closed their doors.

Except where there had been a conviction the power was limited to cases where it appeared in the course of a winding up that any business of the company had been carried on with intent to defraud and the maximum period for which a disqualification order could be made was five years. The power to make such an order was discretionary. The grounds upon which a disqualification order could be made were later extended by section 33 of the Companies Act 1947 (subsequently consolidated as section 188 of the Companies Act 1948) following the Report of the Committee on Company Law Amendment (1945) under the chairmanship of Cohen J (Cmd 6659).See now the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986.

Beginning June 5, 2023, he hosts the 3:00PM to 6:00PM EST news/information talk-show on  WFOM - Xtra 106.3 FM /1230 AM with his producer Brad “Flounder” Dundon and associate Pete Davis. Previously he hosted a news/information talk-show on Atlanta's WYAY NewsRadio 106.7. The Show consisted of Peterson as host, Pete Davis as co-host/sports anchor/producer, Chad ""The Hangman"" Potier as associate producer/call screener and show engineer Jon Michael ""Jon-Boy"" Drain.  From 1992 through 2006, he hosted a radio talk show on WGST-AM in Atlanta, Georgia. Formerly a United States Marine from 1966 to 1969, he served in Vietnam during the Vietnam War and was discharged as a sergeant.  Before becoming a radio host, Peterson was a television anchor in Chicago and New Orleans. He was on rival news-talk station WSB before he came to WGST. After his firing from WSB Peterson would refer to his former employer as ""WSOB"" and ""WBS"" (and sometimes ""We Suck and Blither"").
Peterson was a donor for the Marine's Toys for Tots Christmas drive, and from 1997 to 2005 he produced a comedy bits CD, donating all the proceeds to the drive. In addition he hosted an annual charity golf tournament. Peterson is an avid motorcycle enthusiast.
From December 2005 to May 5, 2006, members of Peterson's support team started to lose their positions at WGST.  Jim Gossett, a voice impersonator who specialized in past presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, and classic celebrities such as Johnny Carson, among others, quit his job in December 2005.  Two months later, WGST-AM's sports director, Pete Davis, was fired for reasons not publicly disclosed.  A final firing among Peterson's team was on May 5, when his producer, Wayne Kitchens, was terminated. Kitchens told an online media outlet (Buzz) that management was upset when he didn't bleep out an anti-Muslim statement Peterson said on the air the week prior to his firing. Kitchens has speculated that the firings were an attempt to force Peterson to quit.
Peterson's final broadcast for WGST was on November 20, 2006. The station announced the next day that he was no longer on the air.


== The Kimmer Show ==
The Kimmer Show is a 3:00PM to 6:00PM EST news/information talk-show on  WFOM - Xtra 106.3 FM /1230 AM with his producer Brad “Flounder” Dundon and associate Pete Davis.The Kimmer Show previously was an afternoon radio talk show on Atlanta's WYAY Talk 106.7 radio station hosted by Peterson, and featuring Pete ""Snake"" Davis, Chad ""Hangman"" Potier, and John-Boy.  The show was formerly broadcast on the WGST AM radio station (640 kHz) in Atlanta.
WGST and Kim Peterson produced a ""best-of"" highlights audio CD of his show every year from 1996 to 2005. It was called ""The Kimmer Komedy Klassics."" One year the CD included an additional DVD of the Kimmer roast event.  The final CD was released in December 2005; it included a bonus disc with all 10 years of ""Kimmer Komedy Klassics"" in mp3 format.  All CD sales profits were donated to the U.S. Marine Corps ""Toys for Tots"" program as part of the WGST yearly Christmas fund drive.
In addition to scheduled segments, Peterson had regular listeners who frequently called in to his show. The group ranged from an outspoken liberal caller he referred to as ""Commie Dave,"" who was eventually given 60 seconds per week to rant, to Helper John and the police and truck drivers who called in just to say ""hello."" Peterson's regular staff included producer Wayne (""No Offense!"") Kitchens, who later worked for Eagle 106.7 FM, the late Keith Kalland (1951–2002), Art ""Madman"" Merrhing with traffic reports, and Pete ""Snake"" Davis at 5:15 with a daily sport segment (which Peterson referred to as the ""Holy Crap It's Sports"" segment).
One popular feature of Peterson's program was known as ""Flush The Lines."" He would tell listeners to call en masse and would put everyone who called on the air for just a few seconds to make a (usually comedic) remark.
As of about noon November 21, 2006, Kimmer's page on the WGST.com website was taken down, and at 3 p.m. it was announced that The Dave Ramsey Show (originating from flagship 99.7 FM WWTN Nashville) would air live from 3 to 6 p.m. in the Atlanta market. Peterson, along with the remaining vestiges of local talent on WGST, Denny Schaffer and Tom Hughes, were fired on November 21 as part of the nationwide restructuring of ClearChannel's radio properties. [1]On March 13, 2007, it was posted on an Atlanta radio blog that Peterson had refused an unnamed offer and would retire from radio. The blog's writer, Rodney Ho, confirmed this with Peterson.  It was later revealed that the station was Dickey Broadcasting's WCNN/680 The Fan.
In April 2010 Peterson partnered with Josh Price of the website Conservative Beacon to do a series of podcasts.  It was anticipated that in addition to remembering his WGST radio show, Peterson would offer his opinion on current events. The podcasts ended in June of that year.
On October 22, 2013, it was reported that Kim Peterson was returning to Atlanta radio and would appear from noon to 3 p.m. weekdays on WYAY All News 106.7 FM starting Nov. 4, 2013.  Joining him would be Jim ""Newsmaker Line"" Gossett and Pete ""Snake"" Davis.  Wayne ""No Offense"" Kitchens was unable to return due to other obligations.
On April 16, 2018, Cumulus Radio, owner of WYAY, announced that Kimmer's show would be moved to the afternoon drive (3-6pm.), replacing Brian Joyce in that slot.
On February 13, 2019, Cumulus announced plans to sell several of its stations, including WYAY, to Educational Media Foundation, which operates the syndicated Christian pop format ""K-Love.""  WYAY officially became a K-LOVE affiliate on May 31, 2019 immediately following Kimmer's final show.
On December 13, 2019, Kimmer Show started a podcast on Patreon.

Pigeon Island National Park,"Pigeon Island National Park is one of the three marine national parks of Sri Lanka. The national park is situated 1 km off the coast of Nilaveli, a coastal town in Eastern Province, encompassing a total area of 471.429 hectares. The island's name derives from the rock pigeon which has colonized it. The national park contains some of the best remaining coral reefs of Sri Lanka. Pigeon Island was designated as a sanctuary in 1963. In 2003 it was re-designated as a national park. This national park is the 17th in Sri Lanka. The island was used as a shooting range during the colonial era. Pigeon Island is one of the several protected areas affected by the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004.


== Physical features ==
Pigeon Island consists of two islands; large pigeon island and small pigeon island. The large pigeon island is fringed by a coral reef, and is about 200 m long and 100 m wide. Its highest point is 44.8 m above mean sea level. The small pigeon island is surrounded by rocky islets. The national park is situated within the dry zone of Sri Lanka. The mean annual temperature is  around 27.0 °C (80.6 °F). The annual  rainfall ranges between 1,000–1,700 millimetres (39–67 in) while most of the rain is received during the North-eastern monsoon season from October to March.


== Flora and fauna ==
The large pigeon island's coral reef fauna is dominated by Acropora spp. with some Montipora spp. Faviidae, Mussidae and Poritidae species dominate the coral reef around the rocky islets. Areas with soft corals such as Sinularia, Lobophyton, and Sarcophyton can also be observed. The coral reef harbors many vertebrates and invertebrates. Many of the 100 species of corals and 300 coral reef fishes recorded around the Trincomalee area are found in the national park. Juvenile and adult blacktip reef shark are seen around the shallow coral areas. Hawksbill turtle, green turtle and olive ridley are the visiting sea turtles of the coral reef. The island is important breeding ground for the rock pigeon.


== Conservation ==
Fishing and ornamental fish collection are the main economic usages of the coral reef. The pigeon island is also used as a scuba diving site. Uncontrolled tourism has resulted in reef degradation and loss of biodiversity and fish density. Scientific research was hindered due to the civil war in the past two decades. A proposed pier between the mainland coast and the island has attracted criticism.

Carriage Room,"The Carriage Room was a strip club in Portland, Oregon, in the United States. The bar and restaurant closed in 1988.


== Description and history ==
The bar and restaurant operated for eighteen years at 1000 Southwest Broadway, underneath the Broadway Theatre, in downtown Portland. The club was one of seven owned by Roy Keller (three were in Portland and four were in Sacramento, California; only Carriage Room and Mary's Club were strip clubs). Carriage Room also hosted comedy acts as performances. Sammy Davis Jr. and Mort Sahl performed at the venue.In 1969, commenting on the public debate of topless dancing, Carriage Room owner Dave Russell told The Oregonian: ""What we're aiming at here is sort of the Las Vegas lounge show... We don't believe a show has to be topless to make money, but we have to compete with other clubs, and they have to serve what the customer wants."" The newspaper said Carriage Room performers were not allowed to mingle with or accept drinks from patrons, or date male colleagues. In 1971, Lottie D. Freeman, who performed at the club as ""Casey Champagne"", challenged Portland's ban on bottomless dancing, claiming the restriction violated First Amendment protections of freedom of expressions. However, circuit judge William M. Dale upheld the ordinance, ending a temporary injunction preventing officers from enforcing the ban for eight days. In 1976, a fire caused $7,500 damage, impacted nearby traffic, and threw smoke into the Broadway Theatre. Mostly the kitchen was damaged, but the restaurant was forced to close for several days.Comedian Wallace ""Wally"" Blair Woolstencroft served as master of ceremonies at the Carriage Room from the late 1960s to mid 1970s. In 1980, The Oregonian's described the bar as a space where ""X-rated entertainment rules the roost"". Royce Looby Tomkin, once manager of Carriage Room and Mary's Club, died in 1984. Irene E. Pattison served as a waitress at Carriage Room for 32 years, starting in 1954. She managed the restaurant for eighteen years, before retiring in 1984. Vickie Anderson was a manager of Carriage Room and Mary's Club, as of 1984. During mid 1984, Carriage Room dancers reportedly ""cruised the harbor on a motor launch, revealing their charms to the sailors"" arriving for Fleet Week, as part of the Portland Rose Festival.
In 1985, Jonathan Nicholas of The Oregonian described the club as ""Portland's most venerable pleasure palace"". Furthermore, he wrote: The Carriage Room was once the home of Portland's last burlesque show, a place where the dancers still wore feathers and sequins and put on something more (a show) than they took off. But the '80s have invaded the Carriage Room with a vengeance. Today the women take to the stage as if they're at aerobics classes at the 'Y.' Their moves owe more to Jane Fonda than to Gypsy Rose Lee. And at the end of each number, they lounge on stage looking like puppets on which someone has just cut the strings. Then the scratchy music cranks up again, and they resume their relentless, listless homage to men's vanity and six bucks an hour.""
Carriage Room closed in 1988 when the theatre was demolished, and Keller changed his focus to Carmen's Restaurant and Carriage Room Lounge in northeast Portland.In 2008, The Portland Mercury published a retrospective article called ""Best of Portland 1988"", which briefly profiled a dancer who performed at Carriage Room and Mary's Club. According to the newspaper, the women at Carriage Room were ""more cabaret performers than strippers, taking the stage to perform (to a soundtrack on cassette tapes) in dramatic evening gowns, with less emphasis on getting undressed"".

Eurasian brown bear,"The Eurasian brown bear (Ursus arctos arctos) is one of the most common subspecies of the brown bear, and is found in much of Eurasia. It is also called the European brown bear, common brown bear, common bear, and colloquially by many other names. The genetic diversity of present-day brown bears (Ursus arctos) has been extensively studied over the years and appears to be geographically structured into five main clades based upon analysis of the mtDNA.


== Description ==
The Eurasian brown bear has brown fur, which ranges from yellowish-brown to dark brown, red-brown, and almost black in some cases; albinism has also been recorded. The fur is dense to varying degrees and the hair can grow up to 10 cm (3.9 in) in length. The head normally is quite round and has relatively small rounded ears, a wide skull, and a mouth equipped with 42 teeth, including predatory teeth. It has a powerful bone structure and large paws equipped with claws that can grow up to 10 cm (3.9 in) in length. The weight varies depending on habitat and the time of the year. A full-grown male weighs on average between 250 and 300 kilograms (550 and 660 lb), and reaches a maximum weight of 481 kg (1,060 lb) and length of nearly 2.5 m (8.2 ft). Females typically range between 150 and 250 kg (550 lb). They have a lifespan of 20 to 30 years in the wild.


== History ==
Eurasian brown bears were used in Ancient Rome for fighting in arenas. The strongest bears apparently came from Caledonia and Dalmatia.In antiquity, the Eurasian brown bear was largely carnivorous, with 80% of its diet consisting of animal matter. However, as its habitat increasingly diminished, the portion of meat in its diet decreased with it until by the late Middle Ages, meat consisted of only 40% of its dietary intake. Today, meat makes up little more than 10–15% of its diet. Whenever possible, the brown bear will consume sheep.Unlike in North America, where an average of two people a year are killed by bears, Scandinavia only has records of three fatal bear attacks within the last century. However, in late 2019, brown bears killed three men in Romania in just over a month.


== Species origin ==
The oldest fossils are from the Choukoutien, China, and date back about 500,000 years. It is known from mtDNA studies that during the Pleistocene ice age it was too cold for the brown bear to survive in Europe except in three places: Russia, Spain, and the Balkans.Modern research has made it possible to track the origin of the subspecies. The species to which it belongs developed more than 500,000 years ago, and researchers have found that the Eurasian brown bear separated about 850,000 years ago, with one branch based in Western Europe and the other branch in Russia, Eastern Europe and Asia. Through the research of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), researchers have found that the European family has divided into two clades—one in the Iberian Peninsula and the Balkans, the other in Russia.There is a population in Scandinavia that includes bears of the western and eastern lineages. By analyzing the mtDNA of the southern population, researchers have found that they have probably come from populations in the Pyrenees in Southern France and Spain and the Cantabrian Mountains (Spain). Bears from these populations spread to southern Scandinavia after the last ice age. The northern bear populations originate in the Finnish/Russian population. Probably their ancestors survived the ice age in the ice-free areas west of the Ural Mountains, and thereafter spread to Northern Europe.


== Distribution ==
Brown bears could once be found across most of Eurasia, compared to the more limited range today. General habitats included areas such as grassland, sparsely vegetated land, and wetlands.
Although included as of Least Concern on the 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (which refers to the global species, not to the Eurasian brown bear specifically), local populations, specifically those in the European Union, are becoming increasingly scarce. As the IUCN itself adds: ""Least Concern does not always mean that species are not at risk. There are declining species that are evaluated as Least Concern.""
The brown bear has long been extinct in the British Isles (at least 1,500 years ago, possibly even 3,000 years ago), Denmark (about 6,500 years ago), the Netherlands (about 1,000 years ago, although later singles rarely wandered from Germany), Belgium and Luxembourg, with more recent extinctions in Germany (in the year 1835, although singles wandering from Italy were recorded in 2006 and 2019), Switzerland (in 1904, although a single was seen in 1923 and since 2005 there has been an increasing number of sightings of wanderers from Italy), and Portugal (in 1843, although a wanderer from Spain was recorded in 2019).Globally, the largest population is found east of the Ural mountain range, in the large Siberian forests; brown bears are also present in smaller numbers in parts of central Asia (former Soviet states).
The largest brown bear population in Europe is in Russia, where it has now recovered from an all-time low caused by intensive hunting. Populations in Baltoscandia are similarly, albeit slowly, increasing. They include almost 3,000 bears in Sweden, 2,000 in Finland, 1,100 in Estonia and around 100 in Norway.
Large populations can also be found in Romania (around 6,000), Slovakia (around 1,200), Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia (1,200), Slovenia (1,100), North Macedonia, Bulgaria, Poland, Turkey, and Georgia.
Small but still significant populations can also be found in Albania, Greece, Serbia and Montenegro. In 2005, there were an estimated 200 in Ukraine; these populations are part of two distinct metapopulations: the Carpathian with over 5000 individuals, and the Dinaric-Pindos (Balkans) with around 3000 individuals.There is a small but growing population (at least 70 bears) in the Pyrenees, on the border between Spain and France, which was once on the edge of extinction, as well as two subpopulations in the Cantabrian Mountains in Spain (amounting to around 250 individuals). There are also populations totalling around 100 bears in the Abruzzo, South Tyrol and Trentino regions of Italy. Bears from the aforementioned Italian regions occasionally cross over to bordering Switzerland, which has not hosted a native population since its last bear was shot and killed in Graubünden in 1904.Outside Europe and Russia/the CIS, clades of brown bear persist in small, isolated, and for the most part highly threatened populations in Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, parts of northwest India and central China, and on the island of Hokkaido in Japan.


== Cultural depictions ==
The historic distribution of bears and the impression the Eurasian brown bear has made on people are reflected in the names of several localities (some notable examples include Bern, Medvednica, Otepää and Ayu-Dag), as well as personal names—for example, Xiong, Bernard, Arthur, Ursula, Urs, Ursicinus, Orsolya, Björn, Nedved, Medvedev, and Otso.
Bears of this subspecies appear very frequently in the fairy tales and fables of Europe, in particular, tales collected by Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm. The European brown bear was once common in Germany and alpine lands like Northern Italy, Eastern France, and most of Switzerland, and thus appears in tales of various dialects of German.
The bear is traditionally regarded as the symbol of Russian (military and political) might. It is also Finland's national animal; and in Croatia, a brown bear is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 5 kuna coin, minted from 1993 to 2023.

Greenberg Traurig,"Greenberg Traurig is a multinational law and lobbying firm founded in Miami in 1967 by Larry J. Hoffman, Mel Greenberg and Robert H. Traurig. As of 2022, it is the 9th largest law firm in the United States. The firm has 45 locations in the U.S., Europe and the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia, and approximately 2650 attorneys worldwide.Their largest office is in New York City, and their clients have included Diane Von Furstenberg Studios, Conde Nast Publications, The New Yorker, New Yorker staff, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and the plastics industry.


== History ==
In the 1970s, Greenberg, Traurig and Hoffman became Greenberg, Traurig, Hoffman, Lipoff, and Quentel with the addition of attorneys Norman H. Lipoff and Albert D. Quentel as named shareholders. The late Florida governor Reubin Askew was a named shareholder in the early 1980s while he also sought the Democratic nomination for president.Larry Hoffman became managing partner of the firm in 1991, at which point the firm began to expand nationwide, beginning with the opening of an office in New York City. Greenberg Traurig expanded to Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles and Wilmington (Delaware) in 1999; in 2000, the firm doubled the size of its New York City office by acquiring the local office of the defunct Graham & James.
In July 2009 Greenberg Traurig opened an office in London under the name of Greenberg Traurig Maher LLP (since renamed to Greenberg Traurig, LLP).  The London office is currently located in The Shard skyscraper.According to OpenSecrets, Greenberg Traurig was one of the top law firms contributing to federal candidates during the 2012 election cycle, donating $1.49 million, 50.2% to Democrats.  By comparison, during that same period Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld donated $2.56 million, 66% to Democrats, while oil conglomerate ExxonMobil donated $2.66 million, 88% to Republicans.  Since 1990, Greenberg Traurig contributed $11.2 million to federal campaigns.In 2013 the firm launched a residency program to hire associates who are not recruited in traditional on-campus interviews by allowing them to spend up to a third of their billable hours in training for a one-year trial period.In 2016, Brian Duffy became CEO. In July 2018, founding member Robert Traurig died at age 93 in Miami, Florida.


== Corporate social responsibility ==
During 2011-2013, Greenberg Traurig participated in the American Bar Association's National Pro Bono Week.The Greenberg Traurig Holly Skolnick Fellowship Foundation was established in 1999. The Foundation supports Equal Justice Works public interest lawyers. Previously named the Greenberg Traurig Fellowship Foundation, the program was renamed in 2013 in honor of the late Holly Skolnick, a Greenberg Traurig shareholder who helped establish the foundation and served as its president.In 2020, Greenberg Traurig became the first law firm certified to be net carbon neutral by the Center for Resource Solutions. In October 2022, they were named a Mansfield Rule 5.0 Certified Plus firm, which requires at least 30% of leadership roles and 30% of staffed lawyers come from historically underrepresented groups.


== Finances ==


== Awards and rankings ==
It is the ninth largest law firm in the United States by headcount and ranks in the top 20 of the Am Law 100 by gross revenue, in the top 10 of the NLJ 500, and in the top 25 of the Global 200.


== Controversies ==
In January 2001, lobbyist Jack Abramoff left Preston Gates & Ellis to join Greenberg Traurig. At the firm he assembled ""Team Abramoff"", a lobbying team that was involved in the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal and the monetary influence of Jack Abramoff.
In 2001, Victor Reyes, who headed the Hispanic Democratic Organization, joined Greenberg Traurig and led the firm's Chicago lobbying practice.  After Reyes's arrival, from 2001 to 2005, Greenberg earned $3.5 million in city-related legal fees, including for representing the city in the United Airlines and RCN Cable TV bankruptcies. US Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald subsequently alleged that Reyes's law office was central to a patronage scheme to funnel city jobs to pro-Daley campaign workers. Reyes resigned from Greenberg in August 2005 and wasn't charged, but prosecutors called him as a ""co-schemer"" in the indictment. Greenberg CEO César Álvarez stated, ""I don't know about anything [Reyes] did in the firm that was wrong. I can only know what I have seen, and I only know that he hasn't been charged"".In May 2005, Philadelphia partner Robert S. Grossman pleaded guilty to charges that he had lied in a 1996 bankruptcy case to cover up his improper diversion of over $100,000 to his personal account when he worked as a real estate developer in Virginia.
In June 2006, Greenberg Traurig agreed to pay the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation $7.6 million for its role as a legal adviser to the now-defunct Hamilton Bank of Miami, to settle allegations that it had helped to cover up bank officers' financial misconduct.  The firm paid an additional $750,000 fine to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for allegedly protecting the bank's officers ""by making materially false and misleading assertions and by suppressing material evidence"".
In November 2006, Jay I. Gordon, the former chairman of Greenberg Traurig's tax practice, resigned from the New York bar and was disbarred for taking over $1.2 million in kickbacks on tax shelters that he had recommended to wealthy clients of the firm.In November 2008, a New York State court refused to dismiss a suit alleging that Robert J. Ivanhoe,  head of its real estate group, disregarded his ""legal and fiduciary duties"" by taking a personal financial stake in a competitor to a client that had invested in a multibillion-dollar real estate venture. The former client had sued Ivanhoe and Greenberg Traurig in April 2008 for breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, tortious interference with prospective economic damages, and malpractice. Greenberg Traurig responded that the allegations were ""without merit"" and that it would appeal the ruling.In December 2008, the firm and several current and former firm attorneys (Harley Lewin and Steven Wadyka) were sued in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia by Catherine and Richard Snyder of Herndon, Virginia.  Also named in the suit, Greenberg Traurig's client, Diane Von Furstenberg Studios, Conde Nast Publications, The New Yorker and New Yorker staff reporter, Larissa MacFarquhar. The Snyders' suit stems from a suit filed in the same court by Diane Von Furstenberg Studios against Catherine Snyder in December 2006 for trademark infringement, which resulted in an award of damages to DVF Studios.In 2014, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) looked into insider trader allegations between United States House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health staff director Brian Sutter and Mark Hayes, a lobbyist at Greenberg Traurig.  In November, 2015, New York U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe ordered the Committee and a former staffer to respond to an SEC subpoena request , but he did term the request ""overbroad."" The SEC sought to determine whether Sutter or anyone else from the Committee tipped off lobbyist Mark Hayes of Greenberg Traurig, which information was then forwarded to Height Securities LLC. Judge Gardephe reasoned that the congressional Speech and Debate Clause does not provide protection for information communicated by a legislative member or aide to a member of the public, and that Sutter's statements to employees of Greenberg are consequently not protected and must be produced. After two years of litigation and its 2nd Circuit appeal of the subpoena in December 2015, the Committee finally dropped its opposition to the order requested by the SEC.In May 2018, the firm parted ways with Rudy Giuliani over his allegations that he would pay his clients' adversaries hush money in a manner consistent with the Stormy Daniels affair.  Mr. Giuliani suggested that such payments were common, even without the knowledge of the clients.

The MultiGen modeling package (known now as Creator) and the OpenFlight format were rapidly adopted by the early commercial flight simulation industry in the later 1980s and early 1990s. NASA Ames was the first customer for the MultiGen modeling package.The early advantage OpenFlight held over many 3d geometry model file formats (.obj, .dxf, .3ds) was its specific real-time 3d graphics industry design.  This means that the format is polygon based (rather than NURB surfaces), and provides a real-time tree structure essential for real-time IG systems.  Most early graphics file formats, such as Wavefront Technologies, or Alias Systems Corporation, tried to focus more on visual aesthetics for non-real-time based rendering graphics packages.
The OpenFlight file format is still widely used today in the high end real-time visual simulation industry as the standard interchange format between different IG systems, and is currently administrated by Presagis.

=== Associated File Formats ===
OpenFlight models can have several associated files in different formats, that define elements such as material characteristics or shaders.


== Versions and History ==


== API ==


== Modeling Tools ==
There are several modeling tools currently on the market that both read and write the OpenFlight file format.  The standard bearer of the file format Presagis Creator offers the widest compatibility with the file format. Another modeling tool using OpenFlight as its native format in Remo 3D from Remograph. Blender previously had integrated support for importing models in OpenFlight format. However, it appears as though this functionality has been abandoned in newer versions and there is currently no support for exporting to this format. Autodesk 3DS Max still supports exporting to OpenFlight format as of the 2024 version of their software.


=== Vendor specific alterations ===
Because the OpenFlight file format allows for vendor specific data field additions, some modeling and simulation tools might not fully support vendor specific additions to the file format.

Heather Oakes,"Heather Regina Oakes (née Hunte born 14 August 1959) is a female English former sprinter who competed mainly in the 100 metres. In the 4 × 100m relay, she won Olympic bronze medals in Moscow 1980 and Los Angeles 1984. She also won a silver medal in the 60m at the 1985 World Indoor Games, and a gold medal in the 100m at the 1986 Commonwealth Games.


== Career ==
Oakes was born in Hackney, London. She was a member of the Haringey Athletic Club. In 1977, as Heather Hunte, she finished fourth in the 100 m final at the European Junior Championships in Donetsk, being edged out of a medal by teammate Kathy Smallwood (11.71 - 11.72). She won a bronze medal in the sprint relay.
On 21 May 1980, at a meeting at the Crystal Palace, she ran the 100 metres in a wind-assisted 11.01 secs (+4.0). Later that year she competed for Great Britain at the Olympic Games in Moscow, where she won a bronze medal in the 4 × 100 metres relay, with her teammates Smallwood, Beverley Goddard and Sonia Lannaman. They ran a UK record of 42.43, which stood as the UK record until 2014. She also placed eighth in the 100 m final in 11.34 secs. In 1982, now competing as Heather Oakes, she finished seventh in the 100 metres final at the Commonwealth Games in 11.39. In 1983, at the World Championships in Helsinki, she reached the semi-finals of the 100 metres, running 11.50.
At the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, Oakes reunited with two of her Moscow teammates, Kathy Cook (Smallwood)) and Beverley Callender (Goddard) to win another bronze medal in the 4 × 100 m relay, they were joined by Simmone Jacobs. In the 100 m final, she finished seventh in 11.43. She had a fine indoor season in 1985, winning medals at both the World Indoor Games and the European Indoor Championships. At the World Indoors in January in Paris, she won a silver medal in 7.21 secs, just one-one hundredth of a second behind the winner Silke Gladisch. Then at the Europeans in March, she won the bronze medal behind Nelli Cooman and Marlies Gohr, but ahead of Gladisch.
Oakes  became Commonwealth 100 m champion in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1986. She won in a lifetime best time of 11.20 secs. In an incredibly close race, she edged ahead of teammate Paula Dunn (11.21) and Canada's Angella Issajenko (also 11.21). Oakes later teamed up with Dunn, Kathy Cook and Joan Baptiste, to win the gold medal in the sprint relay. Oakes anchored the England quartet to victory  in 43.39. Later in 1986, she reached the semi-finals of both the 100 and 200 metres at the European Championships in Stuttgart. In the 200 m, an event that she rarely contested. she ran a lifetime best of 22.92 secs.During her career, Oakes won four AAAs National titles and five UK National titles. As of 2022, her legal 100 m best (11.20) ranks her 18th on the UK all-time list, her 200 m best (22.92) ranks her 30th, while her 60 m best (7.21) ranks her 12th.
While Oakes competed at the highest level for her country, she also held down a full-time job. This is in contrast to today's athletes, who through lottery funding and sponsorship are able to train and compete without distraction. She is married to fellow Olympic bronze medallist Gary Oakes.

Yaqui River,"The Yaqui River (Río Yaqui in Spanish) (Hiak Vatwe in the Yaqui or Yoreme language) is a river in the state of Sonora in northwestern Mexico. It was formerly known as the Rio del Norte. Being the largest river system in the state of Sonora, the Yaqui river is used for irrigation, especially in the Valle del Yaqui.
The Rio Yaqui originates in the Sierra Madre Occidental at the junction of the Rio Bavispe and the Rio Aros at Lat. 29.529887 Long. −109.228377.  It is approximately 320 km (200 mi) in length, and flows south and southwest into the Gulf of California near the city of Obregon.
Its course is interrupted by several reservoirs like Plutarco Elías Calles (El Novillo), Lázaro Cárdenas (Angostura), or Álvaro Obregón (El Oviáchic, Lake Ouiachic), which provides the water resource for the intensively irrigated region of Ciudad Obregón.


== Human history ==
As early as the 6th century AD, native inhabitants known as the Yoeme or Yaqui were living in family groups along the Rio Yaqui.  The Yaqui used simple irrigation techniques to cultivate corn, beans, and squash while also hunting local game and gathering wild foods from the area.  Yaquis traded native foods, furs, shells, salt, and other goods with many indigenous groups of central North America.  The Yaquis lived more or less independently until the late 19th century, when many of them were driven from their lands surrounding the Rio Yaqui by the Mexican Army and forced to flee to more remote areas.  Many Yaquis left the Rio Yaqui area to fight in the Vakatetteve Mountains, while others relocated to Yaqui communities in Arizona.  By the late 1880s, warfare with the Mexican Army had killed off many members of the Yaqui tribe, so that only 4,000 Yaquis remained in the Rio Yaqui area.
In the early 20th century, after a series of conflicts with the Mexican Army, many of the remaining Yaqui were arrested and dispersed to plantations in the Yucatán Peninsula.  The survivors continued resisting until the late 1920s, when Mexican authorities overcame resistance by employing heavy artillery and aircraft to bomb and shell Yaqui villages.
Also in the early 20th century, Major Frederick Russell Burnham, a celebrated American scout, went to Mexico in search of mineral resources.  While there he met the naturalist Dr. Charles Frederick Holder and the two men soon became associated with the early Yaqui River irrigation project. Burnham reasoned that a dam could provide year-round water to rich alluvial soil in the valley; turning the region into one of the garden spots of the world and generate much needed electricity. He purchased water rights and some 300 acres (1.2 km2) of land in this region and contacted an old friend from Africa, John Hays Hammond, who conducted his own studies and then purchased an additional 900,000 acres (3,600 km2) of this land—an area the size of Rhode Island. He became a close business associate of Hammond and led a team of 500 men in guarding mining properties owned by Hammond, J.P. Morgan, and the Guggenheims in the state of Sonora. Just as the irrigation and mining projects were nearing completion in 1912, the onset of the Mexican Revolution frustrated their plans. The final blow to these efforts came in 1917 when Mexico passed laws prohibiting the sale of land to foreigners. Burnham and Hammond carried their properties until 1930 and then sold them to the Mexican government. In his case study of Burnham's American colonization scheme, Professor Bradford concluded: ""a combination of Indian problems, the intricacies of the developing Mexican revolutionary process, and a less than clear-cut mandate from Washington, DC, served to bring the colony down.""Burnham, together with Holder, made archeological discoveries of what he believed to be remnants of Maya civilization in the region, including the Esperanza Stone. In his book, The Book of the Damned, Charles Fort would use this stone as proof that aliens from outer space had been on Earth. The supernatural nature of this stone would be perpetuated by many other authors in several subsequent books on anomalistics.


== Ecology ==
The Rio Yaqui was once home to the American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) and represented one of the northernmost natural locations for the species. Decades of environmental degradation in the region led to the extirpation of the species from the region. This was nearly the southern extent for the Mexican grizzly bear.
The Mexican native trout or Yaqui trout and 34 other species of fish remains.

HMS Cordelia (1914),"HMS Cordelia was a C-class light cruiser built for the Royal Navy during World War I. She was one of six ships of the Caroline sub-class and was completed at the beginning of 1915. The ship was assigned to the 1st and 4th Light Cruiser Squadrons (LCS) of the Grand Fleet for the entire war and played a minor role in the Battle of Jutland in mid-1916. Cordelia spent most of her time on uneventful patrols of the North Sea. She served as a training ship for most of 1919 before she was recommissioned for service with the Atlantic Fleet in 1920. The ship was placed in reserve at the end of 1922 and was sold for scrap in mid-1923.


== Design and description ==
The C-class cruisers were intended to escort the fleet and defend it against enemy destroyers attempting to close within torpedo range. Ordered in July–August 1913 as part of the 1913–14 Naval Programme, the Carolines were enlarged and improved versions of the preceding Arethusa-class cruisers. The ships were 446 feet (135.9 m) long overall, with a beam of 41 feet 6 inches (12.6 m) and a mean draught of 16 feet (4.9 m).  Cordelia displaced 4,175 long tons (4,242 t) at normal load and 4,676 long tons (4,751 t) at deep load. She had a metacentric height of 1.33 ft (0.41 m) at light load and 2.78 ft (0.85 m) at deep load.The Carolines were powered by four direct-drive Parsons steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft using steam generated by eight Yarrow boilers. The turbines produced a total of 40,000 shaft horsepower (30,000 kW) which gave them a speed of 28.5 knots (52.8 km/h; 32.8 mph). The ships carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of 3,680 nautical miles (6,820 km; 4,230 mi) at 18 knots (33 km/h; 21 mph). The ship had a crew of 301 officers and ratings.The main armament of the Carolines consisted of two BL six-inch (152 mm) Mk XII guns that were mounted on the centreline in the stern, with one gun superfiring over the rearmost gun. Her secondary armament consisted of eight QF four-inch (102 mm) Mk IV guns in single pivot mounts; four on each side, one pair forward of the bridge, another pair abaft it on the forecastle deck and the other two pairs one deck lower amidships. For anti-aircraft defence, the ships were fitted with one QF six-pounder (2.2 in (57 mm)) Hotchkiss gun. They also mounted a pair of twin-tube rotating mounts for 21-inch (533 mm) torpedoes, one on each broadside. The Carolines were protected by a waterline belt amidships that ranged in thickness from 1–3 inches (25–76 mm) and a 1-inch (25 mm) deck. The walls of their conning tower were six inches thick.


=== Wartime modifications ===
In August 1915, her six-pounder anti-aircraft (AA) gun was replaced by an Ordnance QF three-pounder (1.9-inch (47 mm)) Vickers Mk II AA gun. In September–October 1917 the ship's armament was extensively revised. Her forward pair of 4-inch guns were replaced by another six-inch gun, her aftmost four-inch guns were replaced by another pair of 21-inch torpedo mounts and a QF four-inch Mk V gun replaced her three-pounder AA gun. In addition, her pole foremast was replaced by a tripod mast that was fitted with a gunnery director, her conning tower was replaced by a lighter one with thinner armour (0.75 inches (19 mm)) and a flying-off platform installed over the forecastle. This was removed between April and August 1918 when an additional six-inch gun was added abaft the funnels in lieu of her forward main-deck four-inch guns. Cordelia's last four-inch guns, including the Mk V AA gun, were replaced in 1919 by a pair of QF three-inch (76 mm) 20-cwt AA guns abaft the bridge, where the four-inch guns had originally been located. Sometime between 1919 and 1923, the ship received a pair of two-pounder (1.6-inch (40 mm)) Mk II ""pom-pom"" guns on single mounts. All of these changes adversely affected the ship's stability and the additional 21-inch torpedo tubes and the aft control position were removed by the end of 1921.


== Construction and career ==
Cordelia, the third ship of her name in the Royal Navy, was laid down by Pembroke Dockyard in Pembroke Dock, Wales, on 21 July 1913. She was launched on 23 February 1914, and completed in January 1915. Commissioned into service in the Royal Navy that same month, Cordelia was assigned to the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron (LCS) of the Grand Fleet.In early August 1914, Cordelia and the rest of her squadron were among the ships dispatched to hunt for the German commerce raider SMS Meteor, which was trying to return to Germany. Although the squadron did not find her, the German ship was forced to scuttle herself by other British cruisers on 9 August to avoid being captured.During the Battle of Jutland on 31 May-1 June 1916, the 1st LCS was assigned to screen Vice-Admiral David Beatty's battlecruisers and were the first British ships to spot and engage the ships of the German High Seas Fleet on the afternoon of 31 May. Cordelia fired four rounds from her main armament at the light cruiser Elbing, but they fell short of the target. The ship was not heavily engaged during the battle and only fired a total of a dozen rounds from her six-inch guns and three from her four-inch guns. So far as is known, she did not hit anything, nor was she damaged herself. By October 1917, she had been transferred to the 4th Light Cruiser Squadron.Cordelia remained with the 4th LCS through at least 1 February 1919. Later that month, she was reduced to reserve at Devonport. By 1 May 1919, however, she had been assigned to the Devonport Gunnery School, and by 18 January 1920 she had recommissioned for service in the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron in the Atlantic Fleet. and remained there through 18 December 1920.In 1921, Cordelia joined the light cruisers Caledon, Castor, and Curacoa and the destroyers Vanquisher, Vectis, Venetia, Viceroy, Violent, Viscount, Winchelsea, and Wolfhound in a Baltic cruise, departing British waters on 1 September. The ships crossed the North Sea and transited the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal to enter the Baltic Sea, where they called at Danzig in the Free City of Danzig; Memel in the Klaipėda Region; Liepāja and Riga, Latvia; Tallinn, Estonia; Helsinki, Finland; Stockholm, Sweden; Copenhagen, Denmark; Gothenburg, Sweden; and Kristiania, Norway. The shipss left Kristiania on 13 September, making for Invergordon.Cordelia patrolled off the coast of Ireland in 1922 during the Irish Civil War. In December 1922, she was decommissioned and placed in the Nore Reserve. She was sold for scrap in July 1923.

Gordon Schildenfeld,"Gordon Schildenfeld (born 18 March 1985) is a Croatian retired footballer who played as a centre-back. He was capped 29 times for the Croatia national team.


== Club career ==


=== Šibenik ===
Schildenfeld began playing football at his hometown club HNK Šibenik. The club's then manager Stanko Mršić gave him his senior debut at age 16 against Kamen Ingrad. In the 2005–06 season, Schildenfeld helped Šibenik win promotion to the top flight.


=== Dinamo Zagreb ===
Midway through his first season in the Croatian first division, the country's top clubs Dinamo Zagreb and Hajduk Split became interested in signing Schildenfeld and his Šibenik teammate Ante Rukavina. It first seemed likely that Schildenfeld and Rukavina would move to Hajduk together, but then Dinamo entered the race for the two players. In the end, on 2 January 2007, Schildenfeld moved to Dinamo while Rukavina joined archrivals Hajduk. Despite only having five months of top-flight experience at the time, Schildenfeld quickly managed to establish himself as a regular at Dinamo and helped the club winning both Croatian league and cup titles, also netting the crucial away goal against Slaven Belupo in the second leg of the cup final.
In the first part of the 2007–08 season, Schildenfeld was also one of the regulars in Dinamo's UEFA Champions League and UEFA Cup campaign, appearing in five Champions League qualifying matches and four UEFA Cup matches before the club was knocked out of the latter competition in the group stage. Schildenfeld became an unlucky figure in Dinamo's 2–1 defeat at Norwegian side Brann in their second match in the UEFA Cup group stage, causing a penalty and being sent off for a professional foul in the final moments of the first half. He missed the last two group matches, against Hamburger SV and Rennes, because of the red card.


=== Beşiktaş ===
Although he was initially set to stay at Dinamo Zagreb, Schildenfeld was signed by Turkish top club Beşiktaş under unexpected circumstances on 1 February 2008. Beşiktaş were actually ready to sign Schildenfeld's teammate Dino Drpić, but the deal fell through due to Drpić's behaviour after a Croatian league match between Dinamo and Hajduk Split almost two years earlier.
Schildenfeld made his Süper Lig debut on 9 February 2008, coming on as a late substitute in Beşiktaş's 2–0 defeat at Kayserispor. He played his first full Süper Lig match a week later as Beşiktaş beat Ankaraspor 3–2 at home.


=== Duisburg ===
In September 2008, Schildenfeld joined MSV Duisburg of the German 2. Bundesliga on loan until the end of the season.

He made his league debut for the club on 26 July 2009 in a 3–0 win at home to Magna Wiener Neustadt, entering as a substitute for Ferdinand Feldhofer in the 89th minute. He later managed to find his place as a regular at the club, appearing in 34 league matches during the season. His only goal in the league during the season came on 27 March 2010 when he netted the opening goal in a 3–0 win at Kapfenberger SV.During his first season with Sturm Graz, he also made ten appearances for the club in the UEFA Europa League and was also a regular feature in their run to the Austrian Cup title, making six appearances in the competition. On 15 August 2009, he netted a brace against TSV St. Johann in the Austrian Cup, helping Sturm to grab a 4–2 extra-time win in the first-round match. He also completed the full 90 minutes in the Cup final on 16 May 2010, which Sturm won 1–0 against Magna Wiener Neustadt. On 8 June 2010, he signed a three-year contract with Sturm Graz.


=== Eintracht Frankfurt ===
On 7 July 2011, Schildenfeld returned to the 2. Bundesliga to join Eintracht Frankfurt. He played there in his first season 33 out of 34 possible matches, helping the club earn promotion to the top-flight Bundesliga. He scored one goal during the 2011–12 campaign.


=== Dynamo Moscow ===
On 11 July 2012, Schildenfeld signed a three-year contract with Russian Premier League side Dynamo Moscow for an undisclosed fee.


=== PAOK ===
After struggling to become regular starting center back in Dynamo, Schildenfeld moved on loan to Superleague Greece side PAOK.


=== Panathinaikos ===
On 2 August 2013, Schildenfeld went on a loan to Panathinaikos. He stayed for two years being one of the most famous players of the club, winning the Greek Cup against his other Greek club PAOK.


=== Dinamo Zagreb ===
In the summer of 2015, Schildenfeld returned to Dinamo Zagreb with a contract running until summer 2018. In summer 2016 he was linked with Panathinaikos.

William Howitt,"William Howitt (18 December 1792 – 3 March 1879), was a prolific English writer on history and other subjects. Howitt Primary Community School in Heanor, Derbyshire, is named after him and his wife.


== Biography ==
Howitt was born in Heanor, Derbyshire. His parents were Quakers, and he was educated at the Friends public school at Ackworth, Yorkshire. His younger brothers were Richard and Godfrey whom he helped tutor. In 1814, he published a poem on the Influence of Nature and Poetry on National Spirit. In 1821, he married Mary Botham, who, like himself, was a Quaker and a poet. William and Mary Howitt collaborated throughout a long literary career; the first of their joint productions was The Forest Minstrels and other Poems (1821).
In 1831, William Howitt produced a work that naturally resulted from his habits of observation and his genuine love of nature. It was a history of the changes in the face of the outside world in the different months of the year, and was entitled The Book of the Seasons, or the Calendar of Nature (1831). His Popular History of Priestcraft (1833) won him the favour of active Liberals and the office of alderman in Nottingham, where the Howitts had made their home.
They moved to Esher in 1837 and became friends with Elizabeth Gaskell and her husband. In 1838, the publication of his Colonization and Christianity, which was later quoted approvingly by Karl Marx in Capital, Volume I, marked a significant moment. In 1840, they went to Heidelberg, primarily for the education of their children, and remained in Germany for two years. In 1841, William Howitt produced, using the pseudonym Dr Cornelius, produced The Student Life of Germany, the first of a series of works on German social life and institutions. Mary Howitt devoted herself to Scandinavian literature, and between 1842 and 1863 she translated the novels of Frederika Bremer and many of the stories of Hans Christian Andersen.
In 1847 Howitt published the 'Homes and Haunts of the most Eminent British Poets' with the publisher Richard Bently. The Preface to the Second Edition dated 1847, and referring to careful revision of the work is included in the third edition, published by George Routledge & Sons in 1877, suggesting there were either two editions in 1847, or the first edition was earlier.
With her husband Mary wrote, in 1852, The Literature and Romance of Northern Europe. In June of that year William Howitt, with two of his sons, set sail for Australia, where he spent two years in the goldfields. The results of his travels appeared in A Boy's Adventures in the Wilds of Australia (1854), Land, Labour and Gold; or, Two Years in Victoria (1855) and Tallangetta, the Squatter's Home (1857).
On his return to England Howitt had settled at Highgate and resumed his indefatigable book-making. From 1856 to 1862 he was engaged on Cassell's Illustrated History of England, and from 1861 to 1864 he and his wife worked at the Ruined Abbeys and Castles of Great Britain. The Howitts had left the Society of Friends in 1847, and became interested in Spiritualism. In 1863 he published The History of the Supernatural in all Ages and Nations, and in all Churches, Christian and Pagan, demonstrating a Universal Faith. He added his own conclusions from a practical examination of the higher phenomena through a course of seven years.
From 1870 onwards Howitt spent the summers in Tyrol and the winters in Rome, where he died. In 1880 Mary Howitt had a house built for her (which is still standing) in the spa town of Meran in South Tyrol (then part of Austria) and from then on divided her time between Rome and Meran.
Mary Howitt was much affected by William's death, and in 1882 she joined the Roman Catholic Church, towards which she had been gradually moving during her connection with spiritualism. She died at Rome on 30 January 1888.The Howitts are remembered for their untiring efforts to provide wholesome and instructive literature. Their son, Alfred William Howitt, made a name for himself by his explorations in Australia. Anna Mary Howitt was both an artist and a poet, and married Alaric Alfred Watts. Mary Howitt's autobiography was edited by her daughter, Margaret Howitt, in 1889. William Howitt wrote some fifty books, and his wife's publications, inclusive of translations, number over a hundred.

Natvar Bhavsar,"Natvar Bhavsar (born 1934) is an Indian-American artist, based in Soho, New York City for nearly 50 years, noted as an abstract expressionist and color field artist.
Bhavsar's paintings appear in more than 800 private and public collections, including the collections of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney, Australia, the Library of Congress, NYU's Grey Art Gallery, and the Australian National Gallery. In addition, his works have been purchased and displayed by corporations such as the American Express Company, AT&T, Chase Manhattan Bank, and NBC. Bhavsar and his works have been the subject of books, including: Natvar Bhavsar: The Sound of Color, (Robert C. Morgan, 2002) and Natvar Bhavsar: Painting and the Reality of Color, (Irving Sandler, 1999).


== Early life and education ==
Bhavsar is a Gujarati. Born 1934 in village Gothava, near Visnagar in Gujarat, India to a wealthy family, he studied at the Seth CN College of Fine Arts in Ahmedabad. He also graduated in English literature from Gujarat University. Bhavsar earned a Master of Fine Arts degree from the University of Pennsylvania School of Design in 1965, and received a Rockefeller grant.


== Career ==
Bhavsar attained prominence as an artist in India by age 19, working primarily in the Cubist vein. After moving to New York City, he became influenced by the freedom of abstract painting. His style evolved into abstract expressionism and color field painting, and his works often feature a hazy object (absent of direct lines or geometric shapes) in the center of a solid canvas, that projects an astral-like mass of color.
Employing some techniques from the Indian tradition of sand painting, Bhavsar paints in an improvisational manner, ""soaking the canvas with acrylic-based liquid binders that absorb and hold the fine pigment powder. He applies the base using a sifting technique with a screen, during which layers of fine, concentrated pigment are sprinkled and drizzled over the canvas (or paper), which is laid out on the floor so that the artist can walk around the painting and work on it from all sides.""Bhavsar primarily shows his work at Aicon, New York,and the ACP Viviane Ehrli Gallery in Zurich, Switzerland, along with Pundole Art Gallery in Bombay, India. He has been exhibiting his works in one-man shows since 1970. In 2007, the Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University sponsored an exhibition of about 50 of Bhavsar’s works. It was the first United States university to hold a one-man show of a South Asian artist.Earlier in his career, Bhavsar was a John D. Rockefeller III Fund Fellow (1965 –1966), a Guggenheim Foundation Fellow (1975 – 1976), and an Instructor of Art at the University of Rhode Island (1967 – 1969). In 1980 and 1983, he participated in Executive Seminars at the Aspen Institute and, more recently, participated as a Cultural Leader at the World Economic Forums in Davos, Switzerland (2000) and New York (2002). Throughout his career, Bhavsar has associated with a number of acclaimed artists, most prominently, Mark Rothko (1903 – 1970) and Barnett Newman (1905 – 1970).
Bhasvar has been included in the Asian American Arts Centre's artasiamerica digital archive.In 2011, a documentary on his life and works, The Poetics of Color: Natvar Bhavsar, a Painter's Journey was made by Sundaram Tagore.


== Personal life ==
Bhavsar married  American artist and photographer Janet Brosious Bhavsar in 1978, and they have twin sons. The Bhavsars met in art class in the early 1960s, and she drove him to New York City on his first visit in 1963 to look at Picasso paintings at the Museum of Modern Art.

The Bourne Supremacy (film),"The Bourne Supremacy is a 2004 action-thriller film featuring Robert Ludlum's Jason Bourne character.  Although it takes the name of the second Bourne novel (1986), its plot is entirely different. The film was directed by Paul Greengrass from a screenplay by Tony Gilroy.  It is the second installment in the Jason Bourne film series and sequel to The Bourne Identity (2002).
The Bourne Supremacy continues the story of Jason Bourne, a former CIA assassin suffering from psychogenic amnesia. Bourne is portrayed by Matt Damon. The film focuses on his attempt to learn more of his past as he is once more enveloped in a conspiracy involving the CIA and Operation Treadstone. Actors Brian Cox, and Julia Stiles reprise their roles as Ward Abbott, and Nicky Parsons, respectively. Joan Allen joins the cast as Deputy Director and Task Force Chief, Pamela Landy.
Universal Pictures released the film to theaters in the United States on July 23, 2004, to positive reviews and commercial success, grossing $290 million on a $75 million budget. The film was followed by The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), The Bourne Legacy (2012), and Jason Bourne (2016).


== Plot ==
Jason Bourne and Marie Kreutz are living in Goa, India. Bourne, who is still suffering from amnesia, records flashbacks about his life as a CIA assassin in a notebook.
In Berlin, a CIA agent working for Deputy Director Pamela Landy is paying $3 million to an unnamed Russian source for the Neski files, documents on the theft of $20 million seven years prior. The deal is interrupted by Kirill, a Russian Federal Security Service agent who works for oligarch Yuri Gretkov. He kills the agent and source, steals the files and money, and plants fingerprints framing Bourne for the attack.
After finding Bourne's fingerprint, Landy asks Section Chief Ward Abbott about Operation Treadstone, the defunct CIA program to which Bourne belonged. She tells Abbott that the CIA agent who stole the $20 million was named in the Neski files. Some years previously, Russian politician Vladimir Neski was about to identify the thief when he was killed by his wife in a suspected murder-suicide in Berlin. Landy believes that Bourne and Treadstone's late supervisor, Alexander Conklin, were involved and that Bourne killed the Neskis.
Gretkov directs Kirill to Goa to kill Bourne. Bourne flees with Marie; Kirill follows and kills Marie, unaware that they switched seats in the midst of the chase. Bourne leaves Goa and travels to Naples, where he allows himself to be identified by security. He subdues a Diplomatic Security agent and a Carabinieri guard and copies the SIM card from his cell phone. From the subsequent phone call, he learns about Landy and the frame job.
Bourne goes to Munich to visit Jarda, the only other remaining Treadstone operative. Jarda informs Bourne that Treadstone was shut down after Conklin's death, and attacks him; Bourne strangles Jarda to death, before destroying his home in a gas explosion as agents move in.
Bourne follows Landy and Abbott to Berlin as they meet former Treadstone support technician Nicky Parsons to question her about Bourne. Bourne believes the CIA is hunting him again and calls Landy from a nearby roof. He demands a meet-up with Nicky and indicates to Landy that he can see her in the office.
Bourne kidnaps Nicky in Alexanderplatz and learns from her that Abbott had been Conklin's boss. Bourne spares Nicky after she reveals she knows nothing about the mission. Bourne then visits the hotel where the killing took place and recalls more of his mission: he killed Neski on Conklin's orders, and when Neski's wife showed up, he shot her and made it look like a murder-suicide.
Danny Zorn, Conklin's former assistant, finds inconsistencies with the report of Bourne's involvement with the death of the agent, and explains his theory to Abbott. Abbott kills Zorn to prevent him from informing Landy. Bourne breaks into Abbott's hotel room and records a conversation between him and Gretkov that incriminates them in the theft of the $20 million. When confronted, Abbott admits to Bourne that he stole the money, ordered Kirill to retrieve the files, and had Bourne framed before arranging for him to be silenced in Goa. Abbott expects Bourne to kill him, but Bourne refuses, saying Marie would not want him to, and puts a gun on the table and leaves. Landy confronts Abbott about her suspicions and he kills himself; later, she finds an envelope containing the tape of Abbott's conversations with Gretkov and Bourne in her hotel room.
Bourne travels to Moscow to find Neski's daughter, Irena. Kirill, tasked once again by Gretkov with killing Bourne, finds and wounds him. Bourne flees in a stolen taxi and Kirill chases him. Bourne forces Kirill's vehicle into a concrete divider, and leaves behind a seriously wounded Kirill, as Gretkov is arrested with Landy watching in the background. Bourne locates Irena and confesses to murdering her parents, apologizing to her as he leaves.
Later in New York City, Bourne calls Landy. She thanks him for the tape, reveals to him his original name, David Webb, and his date and place of birth, and asks him to meet her. Bourne, who is watching her from a building tells her she looks tired and to get some rest, as he disappears into the city.

== Production ==
The producers replaced Doug Liman, who directed The Bourne Identity.  This was mainly due to the difficulties Liman had with the studio when making the first film, and their unwillingness to work with him again.  British director Paul Greengrass was selected to direct the film after the producers saw Bloody Sunday (2002), Greengrass' depiction of the Bloody Sunday shootings in Northern Ireland, at Gilroy's suggestion.  Producer Patrick Crowley liked Greengrass' ""sense of the camera as participatory viewer"", a visual style Crowley thought would work well for The Bourne Supremacy. The film was shot in reverse order of its settings: some portions of the car chase and the film's ending were shot in Moscow, then most of the rest of the film was shot in and around Berlin, and the opening scenes in Goa, India were filmed last.""Two weeks before [the film's] release, [Greengrass] got together with its star, Matt Damon, came up with a new ending and phoned the producers saying the new idea was way better. And it would cost $200,000 and involve pulling Damon from the set of Ocean's Twelve for a re-shoot. Reluctantly the producers agreed—the movie tested 10 points higher with the new ending"".


== Reception ==


=== Box office ===
The Bourne Supremacy brought in over $52,521,865 on its opening weekend, putting it at No. 1 for the weekend box office (July 23–25, 2004).

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 82% based on 197 reviews, with an average rating of 7.20/10. The site's critics consensus called the film: ""A well-made sequel that delivers the thrills."" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 73 out of 100 based on 39 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""A−"" on an A+ to F scale.Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 out of 4, and wrote: ""That the director, Paul Greengrass, treats the material with gravity and uses good actors in well-written supporting roles elevates the movie above its genre, but not quite out of it.""


=== Accolades ===

May 2011 Peshawar bombing,"The May 2011 Peshawar bombing occurred in Peshawar, Pakistan, when a car bomb was detonated as Nasrullah Khan Afridi (c. 1971-10 May 2011) entered his car after leaving the Tribal Union of Journalists offices. The bomb instantly killed Afridi. No one has been suspected or arrested for the attack. As a tribal journalist, Afridi made many enemies through his journalism. The incident took place in Peshawar's Khyber super market.


== Nasrullah Khan Afridi ==
Nasrullah Khan Afridi had been a journalist for 10 years. The Committee to Protect Journalists said Afridi was a role model journalist in the tribal areas of Pakistan. Afridi worked for the Urdu-language newspaper, Mashriq, before he died. He left behind three sons, three daughters, and a widow.


== Bombing ==
The attack took place late in the evening and was targeted at Nasrullah Khan Afridi. His compressed natural gas tank exploded by a remote controlled car bomb as he got into his car. According to The Tribune, Nasrullah had faced many death threats in the past, particularly from a known militant organisation named Lashkar-e-Islam. Nasrullah Afridi's reporting on terrorist organisations were the main cause of the death threats. Lashkar-e-Islam announced a death threat on Afridi on a pirate radio station in 2006. Almost four years before his death, a grenade was thrown into Afridi's house on 21 May 2007. No one has been found responsible for 10 May 2011 bombing, although sources told Reporters Without Borders that Lashkar-e-Islam is suspect to the killing of Nasrullah Khan Afridi.


== Context ==
Journalists reporting in tribal areas with militant groups face many dangers, for tribes at war and militant groups do not tolerate the media, says The Tribune. The Tribal Union of Journalists (TUJ) reports that 30% of tribal journalist members flee the area they report in for their own safety.Khyber super market in Peshawar is home to many news organisations, making it the perfect place to target reporters who militants find to be a threat. PACT Radio, also set up in Peshawar, reports that the city is becoming more dangerous with frequent attacks on journalists. A month after the May 2011 Peshawar bombing, another bombing occurred, also in the Khyber market area. In this June 2011 Peshawar bombings, at least 34 people died and more than 100 were injured.


== Response ==
Irina Bokova, who is the director-general of UNESCO, made a statement shortly after the Khyber super market bombing saying, ""It is with great concern about the high number of journalists killed in Pakistan that I condemn the killing of Nasrulla Afridi. The time has come for serious action against those who use violence to silence the all important voice of the press.""Mian Iftikhar Hussain, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province's information minister, said, ""Journalists are being targeted because they are writing the truth and those [militants] don't like the truth.""Hundreds of people attended the memorial service for Nasrullah Afridi says CPJ. Soon after the bombing, a memorial football tournament was created in Nasrullah Afridi's honour. On 5 November 2011, political agent, Sayed Ahmad Jan, inaugurated the first football match for Afridi in Jamrud of Pakistan.

Hessischer Rundfunk maintains three resident ensembles: 

hr-Sinfonieorchester (Frankfurt Radio Symphony) – Founded in 1929 by HR's predecessor, the Südwestdeutsche Rundfunkdienst (1924–33), the orchestra is an internationally renowned ensemble. Its 112 musicians perform the whole spectrum of symphonic music dating from the Baroque era to the present day, initiating various new forms of presentation as well as undertaking experimental projects. Although the orchestra is based in Frankfurt, working principally in the German State of Hesse, it is a frequent guest at important international festivals and regularly tours the world. Since the 2021/2022 season Alain Altinoglu has been the orchestra's chief conductor. Important predecessors have included Dean Dixon, Eliahu Inbal, Dmitri Kitayenko, Hugh Wolff, Paavo Järvi and Andrés Orozco-Estrada.
hr-Bigband (Frankfurt Radio Big Band) – The Frankfurt Radio Big Band started life in 1946 as the Radio Frankfurt Dance Orchestra. Since the 1970s it has developed into a jazz big band with the focus on concerts. The Frankfurt Radio Big Band plays approximately 50 concerts every year, performing in every possible jazz-style as well as crossing over into classic, pop, ethno-, and electronic music. After three years as the band's artist in residence, Jim McNeely assumed the position of chief conductor in 2011.
hr-Jazzensemble – In 1958 the German All-Stars led by Albert Mangelsdorff became the Jazztett des Hessischen Rundfunks or alternatively the Albert Mangelsdorff Jazztett, then finally the Jazzensemble des Hessischen Rundfunks, today called the hr-Jazzensemble. The initial idea for a steadily working studio jazz band came from Horst Lippmann. With regular studio recording dates but only seldom live appearances and album releases they initially played arrangements by Joki Freund but increasingly original compositions by Heinz Sauer, Günter Lenz, and Ralf Hübner who all joined in 1961 and in the 1970s also experimented with electronic and computerized sounds and later with sampling techniques. Albert Mangelsdorff, who led the ensemble until his death in 2005, his brother Emil, Freund and Peter Trunk were part of the initial line-up, Bob Degen and Christof Lauer came during the 1970s, all staying over decades. The ensemble could also invite guest musicians especially from the United States like Sonny Rollins, Stan Getz, Jimmy Giuffre, Joe Henderson, Terri Lyne Carrington and Bill Frisell; European guests were among others Alan Skidmore, Tomasz Stańko, Eberhard Weber, Joachim Kühn, Marc Ducret, Simon Nabatov, and Theodosii Spassov. A retrospective double album that documented their work from 1967 to 1993 was awarded with the Preis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik in 1995.

Council of Avignon,"Council of Avignon may refer to one of a number of councils of the Roman Catholic Church which were held in Avignon in France. The first reported council met in the 11th century and the final council on record was in the mid-19th century. 


== Eleventh century ==
The first reported council, Council of Avignon (1060), was held in 1060, though nothing is known about what took place.
In 1080 a council, Council of Avignon (1080), was held under the presidency of Hugues de Dié, papal legate, in which Aicard, usurper of the See of Arles, was deposed, and Gibelin put in his place. Three bishops-elect (Lautelin of Embrun, Hugues of Grenoble, Didier of Cavaillon) accompanied the legate to Rome and were consecrated there by Pope Gregory VII.


== Thirteenth century ==

During the 13th century four councils were held, including the Council of Avignon (1209) in which the inhabitants of Toulouse were excommunicated by the council for failing to expel the Albigensian heretics from Toulouse. Included in the population that was excommunicated were two papal legates, four archbishops and twenty bishops. The next council was held in 1270, and Bertrand de Malferrat, Archbishop of Arles presided over the council. The usurpers of ecclesiastical property were severely threatened; unclaimed legacies were allotted to pious uses; the bishops were urged to mutually support one another; and individual churches were taxed for the support of the papal legates; and ecclesiastics were forbidden to convoke the civil courts against their bishops.
During the Council of Avignon (1279) they were concerned with the clergy's protection of rights, privileges, and immunities. Provisions were also made for those who promised to join the crusade Gregory X had ordered, but had failed to actually go on the crusade. In addition the council decreed that to hear confessions monks must have permission of their ordinary, or bishop, as well as their superior. The last council during the 13th century was the Council of Avignon (1282) , during which they published 10 canons. Among the canons published was one urging people to more regularly attend the parochial churches, and to go to their parish church for at least feast days and on Sundays.


== Fourteenth century ==

The temporalities of the Church and ecclesiastical jurisdiction occupied the attention of the Council of Avignon (1327) . The seventy-nine canons of the  Council of Avignon (1337)  are renewed from earlier councils, and emphasize the duty of Easter Communion in one's own parish church, and of abstinence on Saturday for beneficed persons and ecclesiastics, in honour of the Blessed Virgin, a practice begun three centuries earlier on the occasion of the Truce of God, but no longer universal.


== Fifteenth century ==
The 15th century saw two councils convened, one in 1457 and one in 1497. The 1457 council was held by Cardinal de Foix, Archbishop of Arles and legate of Avignon, who was also a Franciscan. His primary reason was to promote the doctrine of Immaculate Conception, in sense of the declaration of the council of Basle. They forbade the preaching of the contrary doctrine, as well as 64 disciplinary canons that were published, in keeping with the legislation of previous councils. In 1497 Archbishop Francesco Tarpugi (after the council he was cardinal) presided over the council. They published a similar number of decrees to the 1457 council. It was decreed that the sponsors of the newly confirmed were not obligated to make presents to their parents or to them. They also decreed that before the relics of the saints two candles were to be kept lit at all times.


== Later Councils ==
During the next five centuries only six further councils were held. The 1509 council focused on disciplinary measures. The next council, in 1596, was called to discuss the furthering of the observance of the decrees of the Council of Trent, and the 1609 council was held for very similar circumstances. The councils of 1664 and 1725 were held to formulate disciplinary decrees. The 1725 council also decreed the duty of adhering to the Papal Bull Unigenitus (1713) of Clement XI that condemned the Oratorian, Pasquier Quesnel. The final council on record was in 1849 and it published ten chapters of canons concerning discipline and faith.

Gambia national football team,"The Gambia national football team (recognized at The Gambia by FIFA) represents The Gambia in men's international football and is controlled by the Gambia Football Federation. Until 1965, the team and the country were known as British Gambia. The team has never qualified for the World Cup. In 2021, Gambia qualified for the Africa Cup of Nations finals for the first time in history. The team represents both FIFA and Confederation of African Football (CAF).


== History ==
Under the name British Gambia, the team played their first ever game on 9 February 1953 against Sierra Leone, winning 2–1 at home in a friendly. In April 1963, the team entered the L'Amitié tournament in Senegal, a competition mainly for French-speaking nations. They were drawn in a group with France's amateur team, the Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso) and Gabon. Their first match was lost 5–1 to the French amateurs on 11 April. The Gambia drew 2–2 with the Upper Volta on 13 April, and had the same result the very next day versus Gabon. The Gambia did not advance to the next round.
After the tournament in Senegal, the Gambia did not play another match until 16 November 1968, when they travelled to Sierra Leone to play its team in a friendly and lost 2–1. They played again in Sierra Leone in The Gambia's next match on 24 April 1971, and the hosts won 3–1. On 2 May 1971, The Gambia travelled to Guinea for a friendly and lost 4–2. On 14 May 1972, The Gambia returned to Guinea for their first African Games qualifier and lost 8–0 and were knocked out.
In 1975, the Gambia entered its first qualification campaign for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Canada. They were drawn in a qualifier against Guinea, and lost the first leg 1–0 at home on 27 April 1975. The second leg was lost 6–0 in Guinea on 1 June as Guinea advanced 7–0 on aggregate.
In August of that same year, the Gambia entered their first qualification for the African Cup of Nations, with the aim of reaching the 1976 finals in Ethiopia. They were drawn in a two-legged qualifier against Morocco and lost the first leg 3–0 away on 10 August. They lost by the same score in their home leg on 24 August and Morocco advanced 6–0 on aggregate.
After the qualification campaign for the 1976 finals, The Gambia played their first match against a full European side, losing a home friendly 4–1 to Denmark on 30 January 1977.On 12 October 2002, the team got their biggest ever victory in international competition, a 6–0 victory against Lesotho. In May 2014, the Gambia was banned from all CAF competitions for two years after deliberately falsifying players' ages.The nation's fortunes improved in qualification for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. Although they failed to qualify, they took it to the final round of games, including drawing twice with African giants Algeria.
On 13 November, in their first Group D match of 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualification, Gambia defeated Angola 1–3 in Luanda. This was the Scorpions' first away win in an AFCON or FIFA World Cup qualifier ever, at their 40th attempt. An impressive campaign saw them qualify for their first ever major tournament that year. As the lowest-ranked team in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, the Gambia defied the odds by defeating favourites Tunisia in the group stage, finishing unbeaten in 2nd place in the group. A further win against Guinea in the Round of 16 saw them reach the quarter-finals at their first attempt, eventually going out to tournament hosts Cameroon.

Catholic Women's League of Canada,"The Catholic Women's League of Canada  is a national service organization of women who are members of the Roman Catholic Church, and who work together to promote Catholic values and to carry out volunteer and charitable work. In 2016 the CWLA has about 83,000 members in over 1,200 parish councils across Canada. The League's national office is in Winnipeg, Manitoba; it is federally incorporated, and is a registered not-for-profit membership association. The League does not have registered charitable status.Membership is predominantly Catholic women aged 16 and older, but associate membership exists for non-Catholics. There is a parish-based Catholic Girls' League for members 10 to 15 years of age.


== History ==


=== Founding ===
The Catholic Women's League was founded in England in 1906 by Miss Margaret Fletcher. The Canadian organization was founded in 1920 after Katherine Hughes of Edmonton brought news of the British organization to Bishop Emile Legal in Canada. Legal called upon Hughes and Abbé Casgrain to set up an organization to help immigrant women and girls who were seeking work in Edmonton. The organization's first meeting was in November 1912, and as a result a job placement service was set up and Rosary Hall was opened, to provide safe and affordable accommodation.
During the next few years, a number of separate women's groups were established, based on The Catholic Women's League in England: Montreal in 1917, Toronto in 1918 and Halifax in 1919.


=== Early years and first national executive ===
A study group in Montreal known as the Loyola Club became a Catholic Women's Club in 1917, organized by Margaret Jones, with first president Bellelle Guerin. This club became the Montreal City Subdivision in 1920, and claimed the founding subdivision.
At this time all nationally organized women's groups were called to Ottawa to share their opinions with the minister of Reconstruction & Immigration concerning the settling of thousands of immigrants arriving in Canada from war-ravaged Europe. Members of the Montreal Catholic Women's Club, noting that there was no national group of Catholic women, set out to organize one. In March, 1920, invitations were sent to the various Catholic women's groups in Canada, including Hamilton, St. Catharines and Saint John, offering to host a meeting in Montreal for this purpose.
The conference was held on June 17, 1920, with delegates from Edmonton, Regina, Toronto, Hamilton, Ottawa, Sherbrooke, Saint John and Halifax.
Bellelle Guerin, president of the Montreal CWL, was asked to be chairman of the conference.  An executive was elected, organizational details ironed out, and future activities were discussed.  The new League's first act was to send a petition to the federal government asking or stricter divorce laws in Canada.
In 1921 the League chose a motto, For God and Canada. At the annual national convention in 1923 in Halifax, a resolution was passed to adopt Our Lady of Good Counsel as the League's patroness.  In December of that year the CWLC was granted federal incorporation.
During World War II, the League raised $25,000 for the war effort and sent more than 7 million cigarettes to the soldiers overseas.In 1947 the constitution of the CWLC was altered to ensure more clerical supervision of the League's activities, and to set up councils at parish, diocesan and provincial levels.As of 2015, the Catholic Women's League of Canada had 83,990 members.


== Organization ==


=== Councils ===
As well as the national council, there are 11 provincial councils — one of each of the 10 provinces, which includes territories, and a military ordinariate, which was granted provincial status in 1965— 38 diocesan councils and 1,223 parish councils.
Each council administers the affairs at its own level, and sends a representative to the council at the next level. The national council represents the members nationally and internationally.


=== Standing Committees ===
As well as the usual organizational committees, the League has several standing committees related to Catholic values and community service, including Spiritual Development, Christian Family Life, Community Life, and Education and Health.  There is also a Communications committee which facilitates The Canadian League magazine and other publications.


== League Work ==
The League supports women's programs in developing countries through MaterCare International, the Coady International Institute and the Canadian Catholic Organization for Development and Peace, and has raised millions of dollars for local, national and international charities. The League is well known for its parish bake sales which raise funds for charities and parish and community initiatives.Members of the national executive meet annually with federal government ministers on issues raised by resolutions, which come from the parish level, and have included such issues as religious freedom, renewable energy, farmers' rights, abolition of the death penalty, suicide prevention, child poverty, protection of human life and building partnerships and relationships with Canada's indigenous peoples.

Hillclimbing in the British Isles,"Hillclimbing in Great Britain differs from the style of hillclimb motorsport events staged in many other parts of the world, in that courses are generally short — mostly under one mile (1.6 km) in length — and this means that cars and drivers do not generally cross between British events and the longer hillclimbs found in many other parts of Europe.
In the United Kingdom, hillclimbing is considered a spectator sport, and the most prestigious events, such as those that form part of the British Hill Climb Championship, often attract several thousand enthusiasts to the hills. All the courses in Great Britain are situated on private land, but some events in the Channel Islands and all events in Northern Ireland are held on closed public roads. Track lengths are traditionally quoted in yards: the longest hillclimb course in the UK is Cairncastle at 2904 yards (2655 m) and one of the shortest is Val des Terres at 850 yards (777 m). 
The Scottish championship has long been associated with names like Grampian TV and Guyson. Doune and Fintray continue to be included in the championship along with newer venue Forrestburn. Two other venues, Rumster and Kinkell are no longer in use. A notable feature of British and Irish hillclimbing is the very wide variety of vehicles used for competition. Both cars and motorcycles (including sidecars) take part in the sport, and in the case of cars these range from almost standard machines (sometimes driven to and from the tracks) with the only modifications being those required on grounds of safety, right through to specially-built single-seater racing cars. Classic and vintage cars are also very popular in hillclimbing. Generally there are separate meetings for cars and bikes, but occasionally both appear at the same event.
In Great Britain, there is a system of classes which groups cars into broadly similar categories. For example, the classes for ""Racing Cars"" (i.e. single-seaters) are divided into those for cars with engine capacities of under 600cc, 600–1100 cc, 1100–1600 cc, 1600–2000 cc and over 2000 cc. The cars in the unlimited capacity class often use engines from, or derived from, Formula One cars, and occasionally F1 cars themselves have competed. Motorcycles are generally classified by engine capacity, though separate classes exist for trikes and sidecar outfits. Drivers entered for the British Hill Climb Championship may qualify for a ""run-off"" at the end of each set of class runs, and it is here that BHCC or NHCA championship points are scored.
It is common for two drivers, often but not always related, to share the same vehicle at a hillclimb. Such entries are known as ""dual-driven"" (or, occasionally, ""double-driven"") cars or bikes. Usually drivers considered the slower in such partnerships will make the climb first, before the bulk of the class for which they have been entered. This therefore allows their companions to make their ascent within the same time frame as the competitors, to ensure similar track conditions. Other than this, there is no special consideration for drivers in dual-driven cars, and both drivers count their results (and, if appropriate, score points) individually.

Unusual notrump,"In the card game of bridge, the unusual notrump is a conventional overcall showing a two-suited hand. It was originally devised by Al Roth in 1948 with Tobias Stone, to show the minor suits after the opponents opened in a major. 
The convention concept is now generally extended to show the ""two lowest unbid"" suits. Thus, over 1♣, 2NT shows diamonds and hearts; and over 1♦, it shows clubs and hearts. In addition to succinctly describing the hand to the partner, it deprives the opponents of bidding space, i.e. it has a preemptive effect. A drawback is that it provides the opponents with information about the strength and distribution of the overcaller's hand, potentially enabling improved declarer play should they secure the contract.


== History ==
In his seminal 1953 book, The Roth-Stone System, Alvin Roth suggested that poor matchpoint scores usually result when the opponents are permitted to play low-level contracts and recommended protective bidding tactics for the player in the pass-out (balancing) seat in such auctions.He advocated use of weak jump overcalls and responses at a time when the standard practice was for jump overcalls and responses to show strong hands. In one such application - when the opponents reach the two-level having bid only a major – he recommended an overcall of 2NT, as an artificial protective bid indicating,
a probable 9 (or more) points.
strong minor suit holding – 5-4, 5-5 or better – and a request for partner to choose between the minor suits. If necessary, responder must bid a three-card minor suit.
a warning against bidding the unbid major (however, the unbid major may be bid if self-sufficient).


== Current usage ==
When an opponent opens the bidding with 1♥ or 1♠, the immediate overcall of 2NT shows at least 5-5 in the minor suits (that is, at least five clubs and at least five diamonds). If the right hand opponent (RHO) of the partner of the 2NT bid passes, that partner is expected to bid the minor suit that he prefers at the three-level. The unusual notrump applies the principle that when the natural meaning of a bid is not generally very useful, it is profitable to agree that it means something somewhat opposite.  That is, while natural notrump bids show a strong hand with balanced distribution, the unusual notrump shows a weak hand with very unbalanced distribution.
If the 2NT bidder bids again freely, then it shows a strong two suiter.  To distinguish the weak and strong holdings, many partnerships agree not to use the unusual notrump for intermediate hands (about 12 to 14 points); they would simply overcall with one of their suits and show the other later if the bidding offers a chance. However, for two-suiters, many players apply losing trick count (LTC) instead of point count, as it more accurately depicts the offensive trick-taking potential of the hand. With LTC in effect, the required strength is about 4.5–7 losers, the latter only in favorable vulnerability.
Similarly, a 4NT overcall shows an extreme two suiter (usually at least 6-5, often 6-6 or 7-6) and enough trick-taking potential so that a 5-level contract can be made, or a sacrifice will likely be profitable. It shows the same two suits as 2NT would show. Note that 4NT is ""unusual"" only when the opponents open the bidding; otherwise, 4NT is normally played as the Blackwood convention or a quantitative invitation to 6NT.
The Michaels cuebid is a similar convention which is used to show a two suiter with one or both major suits.
To counteract the unusual notrump, the opening side may employ unusual vs. unusual.


== Modifications ==
Recently, the Unusual 2NT has been used in opening seat showing a 5-5 minor suited hand and 7-11 HCP.  The preemptive value of the two suited hand puts pressure on the opponents to find their fits, games and slams at the three level.


== Defense ==
When the opponents open or overcall with an Unusual 2NT, defense uses a bidding scheme which incorporates two features:

the 'double' becomes available as an additional call
the concept of a major-minor pairing is adopted whereby diamonds are associated with spades and clubs with hearts. A cuebid of the paired minor shows a good holding in the corresponding major while a bid of a major shows a weaker holding.After an Unusual 2NT overcall of a major:

After an Unusual 2NT opening:


== Drawbacks ==
Use of the convention with insufficient strength or lengths (such as 5-4 in the minors) may lead to:

Opponents doubling and collecting more penalty points than the contract points they would otherwise have scored.
Opponents outbidding to obtain a major suit contract.
Opponents making a contract owing to the additional information gained about the strength and distribution of the hand of the unusual notrump bidder.

Battle of Alaw Bum,"The battles of Alaw Bum were a series of engagements that took place during the early days of the Myanmar civil war on the Alaw Bum Hill in Momauk Township, Kachin State. The Kachin Independence Army attacked and captured the Alaw Bum military base forcing out State Administration Council defenders and repelling future assaults on the base. The Alaw Bum base is located on the China-Myanmar border near the KIA headquarters in Laiza.


== Timeline ==


=== First Battle ===
The Kachin Independence Army's battalion 25 and 10, alongside soldiers from the Northern Alliance, seized the Mong Pouk and Sheng Htong posts at the base of Alaw Bum hill on the evening of 24 March around 5:30pm. The KIA troops then attacked and captured the Alaw Bum military base on the 25 March, after an 11-hour-long battle with the Tatmadaw.According to Kachin Independence Organisation spokesperson Colonel Naw Bu, the decision to attack was made after the Tatamadaw provoked the KIA by launching artillery attacks from Alaw Bum onto the KIA's Ferlam Bum outpost on 22 March.


=== Second Battle ===
On the 11-14 April, the Tatmadaw conducted multiple assaults on the Alaw Bum military base in response to a Northern Alliance attack on a police station in Naungmon. The Tatamadaw's Light Infantry Battalion 320, consisting of 2 columns of about 100 troops, attacked the Alaw Bum military base. Only two or three soldiers of the initial attack attack on 11 April survived.An additional column from Light Infantry Battalion 387 was sent to attack the following day. The Myanmar Air Force used fighter jets, making 14 sorties to the hill during the attack between 7am and 10pm on 12 April. The air strikes targeted KIA frontline positions, with the majority striking in quick succession around 1pm. According to local residents, the jets crossed the border into China at one point, before returning after China fired warning shots. Two artillery shells fired by Tatmadaw ground troops landed on the Chinese side of the border around 2pm and 5pm. The battalion commander of Light Infantry Battalion 387 was killed during the fighting on 12 April, according to KIA sources.The fighting slowed down until it ceased altogether by 14 April. The KIA arrested 38 remaining Tatmadaw soldiers after the battle ceased.


== Consequences ==
The capture of the airbase, provided the Kachin Independence Army public support and attention. The Tatamadaw continued to attempt to recapture the base periodically, suffering heavy casualties each time. The battle of Alaw Bum would remain the only attack directly commanded by the KIA, with later battles being led by NUG-aligned brigades. The capture of the base strategically stopped artillery attacks on key KIA bases and IDP camps as the Alaw Bum airbase lies close to the KIA headquarters in Laiza.On 30 April, the 77th Light Infantry Division attempted to retake the hill alongside six air raids. At least 20 soldiers were killed as the Tatamadaw failed to retake the hill.

Société Nationale de Crédit et d'Investissement,"Société Nationale de Crédit et d'Investissement (SNCI) is a public-law banking institution in Luxembourg City designed to encourage business investments, start-ups, and research initiatives. Founded in 1978, it is wholly owned by the State of Luxembourg.


== Financial services ==
SNCI provides medium and long-term financing for investments made by Luxembourg-based companies, including Luxembourg companies operating abroad, and start-up loans for small and medium-sized enterprises. SNCI also provides loans for financing professional equipment including equipment for safety or environmental protection. It also offers innovation loans for research-and-development programmes or projects of industrial enterprises and service providers; foreign investments financing; and equity loans for limited liability companies. On average, SNCI loans cover some 25% of investments in fixed assets for industrial projects while up to 75% of eligible start-up investments can be covered for young craftsmen, traders, hoteliers, or restaurant owners.


=== Equipment loans ===
Equipment loans are for investments relating to the creation, extension, reorientation, or takeover of Luxembourg SMEs in the skilled-craft, commercial, hotel, or industrial sectors. They are granted by decision of the SNCI Board of Directors, via an authorized bank, for financing intangible assets (patents, licenses, or software), tangible assets (equipment for the production or provision of services), and land, buildings or parts of buildings to be used for professional purposes. The fixed-rate loans, with a duration of 10 years and to be reimbursed quarterly, usually start at €12,500 and may not exceed €2.5 million. They normally cover from 25 to 60% of eligible costs (75% for a first business) depending on the sector.


=== Start-up loans ===
Start-up loans, designed to encourage new entrepreneurs to create or acquire SMEs, can cover the financing of business plans, land, and buildings to be used for professional activities, working capital, equipment, intangibles (licenses, software), and start-up activities (advertising, studies). Support ranges between €5,000 and €250,000 but may not exceed 40% of eligible costs. The duration is decided on a case-by-case basis depending on the nature of the costs. Reimbursement at quarterly intervals must start within five years but repayments can be made earlier without penalty.


=== Medium and long-term loans ===
Medium-term and long-term loans can be granted to industrial enterprises and service providers, with equity of at least €25,000, for financing tangible and intangible assets and for land to be used for professional purposes. Projects to be financed must have a value of at least €100,000. Loans are usually for 25 to 30% of the investment. They start at €25,000 and may not exceed €10 million unless ministerial authorization is received. Interest is at the ""SNCI prime rate"" at the time the loan contract is signed and is free of commissions and additional charges. The rate is fixed by the SNCI's Board of Directors based on refinancing costs. Medium-term loans are for five years, and long-term loans are for six to 10 years. They are to be repaid in fixed quarterly payments.


=== Innovation loans ===
Innovation loans are designed to assist industrial enterprises and service providers in financing research and development programmes or projects introducing new products, techniques, or services. They usually cover 25% of the eligible costs and have a duration of three to five years. Quarterly repayments must start within a maximum of two years.


=== Equity loans ===
Equity loans are designed to assist Luxembourg limited liability companies in promoting the creation, extension, conversion, reorientation, and rationalization of industrial, craft, and commercial enterprises. Amounts are fixed on a case-by-case basis by the SNCI's Board of Directors and require approval by the competent ministers. The duration is normally no more than 10 years but a forbearance period for repayment of the capital may be accorded. The return is identical to that of the shareholders or partners but with a contractually fixed minimum.


=== Export credits ===

== Recent activities ==
In 2009, the SNCI Board granted loans amounting to EUR 83.6 million, an increase of 63% over the previous year despite the difficult economic climate. Equipment loans, which were already on the rise in 2008 with the financing of EUR 28.9 million for 108 projects, again rose in 2009 to EUR 32.1 million for 104 projects, most being granted to the skilled-craft sector. Large companies were granted nine loans for a total of EUR 18.7 million, compared to six in 2008 (EUR 6.4 million). For start-ups and takeovers, there were 20 loans amounting to EUR 1.7 million compared to 27 in 2008. Most were for very small companies and led to the creation or support of 110 jobs. As a result of non-recurring transactions, overall results for the year were substantially down in 2008 with a profit of EUR 38.13 million compared to EUR 75.2 million.


== Applicable legislation ==

Vidyadhara,"Vidyadhara(s) (Sanskrit Vidyādhara, meaning ""wisdom-holders"") are a group of supernatural beings in Indian religions who possess magical powers. In Hinduism, they also attend Shiva, who lives in the Himalayas. They are considered Upadevas, or demi-gods.


== In Hinduism ==


=== In Hindu epics ===
In the Hindu epics, Vidyādharas are described as essentially spirits of the air. They are described as doing different activities in the epics like gazing at human prowess with astonishment, strewing flowers watching a combat, rejoicing with music and laughter, crowned with wreaths and fleeing with their wives from danger. They possess great magical powers like the ability to diminish their size. They are endowed with epithets describing them as ""doers of good and devoted to joy"". They also live in Gandhamandhana mountain and other Himalayan mountains with Kinnaras. They are also described residing on Mount Krauncha, on Citrakuta where Rama saw Vidyadhara women playing, in the hills of Malabar and in the Khandava forest. They are also seen in Kubera's court, headed by their leader Chakradharman and in Indra's palace under Vipracitti.  A third leader of the Vidyadharas is described to the wise Jambavan. In the epic Mahabharata, Vidyadharas are described as following Indra with other semi-divine beings to the serpent-sacrifice of Janamejaya. In the epics, the women of the Vidyadharas, called Vidyadharis are described to possess great beauty, and were victims of kidnapping by demons like Ravana. In the Ramayana, Sundarkanda Verses 1.22 to 1.26 describe the plight of Vidyadharas and their women following the pressure exerted on Mount Mahendra by Hanuman while taking his position in his attempt to leapcross the ocean.


=== In Puranas and other texts ===
In Agni Purana, they are described as wearing garlands in the sky and mentioned with other semi-divine beings like Yakshas and Gandharvas.In the Bhagavata Purana, Citraketu is described as the king of Vidyadharas. It also tells about a cursed Vidyadhara called Sudarshana. In various references in the Purana, they are coupled with other semi-divine beings, who pray to the god Vishnu for help or enumerated among the many creations of God. The Vidyadhras with siddhas are said to have milked Mother Earth (Prithvi), who had assumed the form of a cow, by using the sage Kapila as the calf and collected different yogic mystic powers (siddhis) and the art of flying as milk in the pot of the sky.Gunadhya is said to have composed seven massive stories about Vidyadharas, then to have destroyed the first six stories when the king rejected them, retaining only the seventh story — of Naravahanadatta — which became the Brihatkatha written in Paishachi language. This work is not extant, but three adaptations exist in Sanskrit: Brhatkathamanjari by Kshemendra, Kathasaritsagara by Somadeva, and Bṛhatkathāślokasaṃgraha by Budhasvamin. The Kathasaritsagara presents some stories about Vidyadharas like Devadatta (a Brahmin boy who acquired Vidyadhara-hood), Jimutavahana, Muktaphalaketu  and  Naravahanadatta (who became an emperor of the Vidyadharas).


== In Jainism ==
Jain legends describe Vidyadharas as advanced human beings or Aakashagochari human beings. According to Jainism, Vidyadharas are human beings but they have vidyas. Vidyadhara possess mystical powers and abilities in Jainism like flying. Vanara and Rakshasa are two of the many Vidyadhara clans according to Jain literature. Some of the Kings were Ravana, Hanuman and Vali.

Dragon Tiger Gate,"Dragon Tiger Gate is a 2006 Hong Kong martial arts action film directed by Wilson Yip and featuring fight choreography by Donnie Yen, who also stars in the film. The film is based on the manhua Oriental Heroes, which bears the same Chinese title as the film. The film's release in all English-speaking territories is handled by The Weinstein Company.A punching bag constructed for the film, measuring about 8 feet (2.4 m) high, 5 feet (1.5 m) wide and weighing about 400 pounds, was certified as the world's largest by Guinness World Records.


== Plot ==
Dragon Tiger Gate is an academy established by two powerful martial artists. It aims to train students in martial arts in order to uphold justice and combat the threat of the Triad. It is also a haven for children who had been orphaned by the Triad. While Luocha Cult is a Pan-Asia heretic cult/drug trafficking organization led by the dictating might of its cult leader: Shibumi the Jashin of Frame Cloud. Shibumi, who is the only master of the legendary Yijin Jing and has many fearsome Kung Fu masters at his disposal, controls the entire Asia-Pacific Underground Drug market with Hong Kong as his base of operations.
The story begins with the two sons of Fu Hu Wong, one of the founders of the academy, who were each born to different mothers. The older is named Dragon and the younger is named Tiger. When the boys were young, Dragon's mother left the academy and gave Dragon half of a Jade amulet pendant and told him that his half-brother, Tiger, has the other half. When Dragon's mother was killed in a fire, Dragon was taken under the care of the Triad boss, Ma Kun, and he grew up to become his bodyguard. Ma Kun's gang is a subject of the evil Luocha Cult, which supervises Hong Kong's Drug dealing on its behalf. Tiger was raised by his elder uncle, Master Xian Lung Wong, after his parents' disappearance.
Several years later, Tiger and his friends are dining in a restaurant and encounter Ma Kun and his men, who are receiving the Luocha Plaque. A symbol of authority within the Luocha Cult indicates that the holder is second only to the cult's leader, Shibumi. Ma Kun and the leader of the White Lions Gang were arguing over the plaque when Tiger accidentally interrupts the meeting. One of Tiger's friends makes off with the plaque while Tiger starts a fight with the gangsters. Just then, Dragon appears and fights Tiger, whom he does not recognize to be his half-brother. Ma Kun calls for Dragon to pull back.
Later that night, Dragon confronts Tiger and his friends at a Japanese restaurant to take back the plaque. Tiger and his friends have been drugged by Scaly, one of Ma Kun's lackeys, who also wanted to retrieve the plaque to prove to his boss that he is the better man. Scaly and his followers fight Dragon over possession of the plaque. Turbo Shek, another eater at the restaurant, is aroused by the commotion and he joins the fight on Dragon's side. Dragon and Turbo defeat Scaly and his men and Dragon takes back the plaque from Tiger. Just then, Tiger discovers that Dragon has the other half of the jade amulet pendant and realizes that Dragon is his half-brother.
Turbo follows Tiger back to Dragon Tiger Gate, wanting to be enrolled into the academy to improve his martial arts skills. He is refused by the current leader of the academy, Master Wong, for his arrogance. Dismayed, Turbo waits outside the academy and promises not to leave unless he is accepted as a student. Master Wong agrees to spar with Turbo and defeats him easily. Turbo is humbled and accepted by Master Wong as a student.
Meanwhile, Ma Kun returns the Luocha Plaque to signify his retirement. He is supported by Dragon, who wants to return to Dragon Tiger Gate, and his daughter Ma Xiaoling, who wants a simple life. Shibumi sees this as an insult and sends his henchmen, the Double Devils, to kill Ma Kun. He uses his subordinate Rosa to lure Dragon away while his minions kill Ma Kun. Dragon returns to rescue Ma Kun, but it is too late. Dragon slays the Double Devils after a vicious fight and leaves Ma Xiaoling in his brother's care before leaving. Although he collapses on a grassland after succumbing to his wounds, he survives after having a vision of his young self giving him the jade pendant (his mother once gave him). Meanwhile, Tiger befriends the grieving Ma Xiaoling.
Shibumi was impressed with Dragon for defeating his henchmen and goes to Dragon Tiger Gate to issue a challenge. With Dragon absent, Master Wong, Tiger, and Turbo takes on Shibumi's challenge but were no match for him. As Master Wong had managed to put up a fight before being defeated, he is deemed worthy enough to die at Shibumi's hands while Shibumi spares the severely wounded Tiger and Turbo for their lack of skill. Ma Xiaoling, realizing that Shibumi will eventually come back for her and the rest of them and with Dragon not there, they would lose just as they had this time, brings Tiger and Turbo to Mount Baiyun to seek help from Master Qi as Dragon senses the passing of Master Wong and returns only to find the demolished Dragon Tiger Gate as he realizes he is too late to protect Master Wong, his brother and Xiaoling and screams in sadness before collapsing. Master Qi heals the wounded Tiger and Turbo and trains them for their incoming final battle with Shibumi, including teaching new martial arts techniques: Spinning Lightning Dragon Kick and Invulnerable Golden Bell Technique. Dragon also practices to fight Shibumi for the first and final time after having reminisced of his time with Xiaoling and appears to have developed a new one.
Tiger and Turbo storm Shibumi's Black Pagoda to stop his reign of terror once and for all and engage him in a fierce fight, using all their greatly improved martial arts abilities and the new techniques they have learned to battle him. However, despite putting up a far better fight than before and even being praised by Shibumi for their improved abilities, Tiger and Turbo are ultimately still outmatched and severely beaten. As Shibumi mocks them for having embarrassed the techniques they have learned and is about to finally kill them, Dragon appears to engage Shibumi, tossing the Plaque back in honor of the Gate, and after luring Shibumi away from his injured brother and Turbo, engages him calmly with his improved abilities as he gains the upper hand and even mocks Shibumi to provoke his temper, eventually killing him with his Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms technique. Before the film ends, Dragon returns to Dragon Tiger Gate together with Tiger and Turbo (who decides to change his name to Leopard) to carry on Master Wong's legacy.

Baseline Road (Colorado),"Baseline Road is a major east-west street in Boulder, Colorado that extends east of the city through parts of four counties.  The western terminus of Baseline Road is at Flagstaff Mountain in the City of Boulder Mountain Parks.  The eastern terminus is at 16800 Watkins Road, about 6 miles (9.7 km) east of Lochbuie on the boundary between Adams and Weld Counties.  The total length of Baseline Road is approximately 38 miles (61 km), all of which is within the Denver-Aurora-Boulder Combined Statistical Area in Colorado. Baseline Road runs almost exactly along the 40th line of latitude.


== Origin of the name ==
On May 30, 1854, the Kansas-Nebraska Act created the Kansas Territory and the Nebraska Territory, divided by the 40th parallel north.  The Pike's Peak Gold Rush of 1858-1861 lured thousands of gold seekers into the goldfields of the northwestern Kansas Territory and the southwestern Nebraska Territory.  On February 28, 1861, the western portion of the Kansas Territory and the southwestern portion of the Nebraska Territory were incorporated into the new Colorado Territory.  The 40th parallel became the primary baseline for surveying the land in the eastern portion of the new territory, and a road was eventually cut along the survey baseline.


== Official names for the road ==
The road along the 40th parallel is officially named Baseline Road in Boulder County and the City and County of Broomfield, 168th Avenue in Adams County, and County Line Road or Weld County Road 2 in Weld County.
A 7-mile (11 km) stretch of Baseline Road, from US 287 in Lafayette to I-25 in Broomfield, is part of State Highway 7.


== Description ==
Baseline Road descends from Flagstaff Mountain (site of the 1935 CCC Sunrise Amphitheatre) and runs through the city of Boulder for its first four miles (6 km).  Within Boulder, it passes the Colorado Chautauqua, a National Historic Landmark, near 9th Street; crosses State Highway 93 (Broadway); then passes the University of Colorado Law School just east of Broadway.  The road then crosses US 36 (28th Street), passes the Williams Village dormitory towers of the University of Colorado, and crosses State Highway 157 (Foothills Parkway).  East of 55th Street, the road seems to terminate at Cherryvale Road.  It actually continues, shifted slightly to the north, following a small northbound stretch of Cherryvale.  Thereafter, the road leaves the city of Boulder and takes on a more rural character until approaching State Highway 42 (95th Street).  At that point the more urban surroundings of Lafayette are evident, and the next two miles (3 km) run through the heart of Lafayette, including the road junction with US 287 (N. 107th St.). 
About one mile (1.6 km) beyond the eastern city limits of Lafayette, the road crosses the eastern boundary of Boulder County and passes the Erie Municipal Airport.  For two miles (3 km) beyond this point, Baseline Road forms the boundary between Weld County and the City and County of Broomfield.  For the next two miles (3 km), from Sheridan Parkway to the interchange with I-25, the road passes through a rural northern portion of the City and County of Broomfield. 
Just east of I-25, the road abuts a commercial area in the extreme northern part of the city of Thornton.  For the next mile, from this point to York Street, Baseline Road marks the boundary between Adams County and the City and County of Broomfield.  From York Street east, the road forms the boundary between Adams County and Weld County for the remainder of its length.
East of York Street, about 10 miles (16 km) of rural road ensue, until Brighton is entered near US 85.  Baseline Road passes through the northern part of Brighton for about five miles (8 km), eventually reaching the town of Lochbuie and the interchange with I-76.  Beyond I-76 the road once again takes on a rural character and continues to its eastern terminus at 16800 Watkins Road.

David Gruber,"David Gruber is an American marine biologist, a Presidential Professor of Biology and Environmental Sciences at Baruch College, City University of New York, and a National Geographic Explorer.


== Early life ==
Gruber was born in Paterson, New Jersey, and received his B.S. at the University of Rhode Island, an M.S. in journalism from Columbia University, a Master of Environmental Management from Duke University and a Ph.D. in Biological Oceanography at Rutgers University Institute for Marine and Coastal Sciences. He completed a post-doctoral position in Molecular Psychiatry at Brown University. David was a 2017–2018 Fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University, and is a current Adjunct Fellow at the John B. Pierce Laboratory, affiliated with the Yale School of Medicine.


== Career ==
Gruber and collaborators reported discoveries of more than 180 new fluorescent fish species in 2014, as reported in The New York Times's article, ""Fluorescence is Widespread in Fish, Study Finds."" In 2015, he observed fluorescence in Hawksbill sea turtles in the Solomon Islands, marking the first time that scientists had observed fluorescence in a marine reptile. Field video of this discovery was featured on National Geographic. Also in 2015, Gruber gave a TED Talk on fluorescence in sea creatures at Mission Blue II which has been viewed over 2.3 million times. In 2020, this discovery was listed by National Geographic as a “top 20 scientific discoveries of the decade” for “Seeing animals’ unexpected sides.” Gruber and collaborators again had video featured on the National Geographic website  in 2016 after engineering a ""shark-eye"" camera, which for the first time allowed scientists to view sharks as they see each other. From 2017 to 2018, Gruber used his time as a Fellow at the Radcliffe Institute of Advanced Study in order to pursue an in-depth study of jellyfish on topics ranging from their fluorescence, to their connection to humans and how they are effected by climate change. Gruber would use this research into jellyfish in order to act as an educator on a TED-ed animation. In 2018, Gruber promoted marine biology for National Geographic Kids' series ""Best Job Ever.""In 2019, Gruber was part of the team responsible for discovering that bromo-tryptophan-kynurenines make sharks fluorescent, and this work was featured in The New York Times, National Geographic, Science Magazine, on PBS and on CNN. That same year, Gruber and team were again featured in an article in National Geographic for their discovery of flashlight fish schooling at night using their bioluminescent organs, which opened up the possibility that schooling fish may inhabit even the deep sea, and Gruber led the first study to apply advanced deep machine learning techniques to better detect and classify Sperm Whale bioacoustics. Gruber currently leads Project CETI, an Audacious project to understand Sperm Whale communication.


=== Delicate exploration/soft robotics ===
Since 2015, Gruber has worked in collaboration with the Harvard MicroRobotics Laboratory in the development of several gentle robotic devices that allow marine researchers to capture and analyze jellyfish and other delicate sea creatures without causing harm.

Grimpoteuthis tuftsi,"Grimpoteuthis tuftsi is an octopus known from seven specimens.


== Description and habitat ==
The specimens were caught by bottom trawling in the Northeastern Pacific Ocean. This octopus was found 3,900 meters deep in the abyssal plain and on the continental slope. It is potentially a demersal species, which means it would live close to the seafloor.The largest of the seven specimens was 475 millimeters in length. Its mantle is 102 millimeters. Each arm has between 63 and 75 suckers; of the suckers, the largest are 2.5 millimeters across. The suckers of Grimpoteuthis tuftsi aren't different sizes or shapes based on the sex of the specimen. Its shell is shaped somewhat like the letter ""W"".

Melbourne cable tramway system,"The Melbourne cable tramway system was a cable car public transport system, which operated between 1885 and 1940 in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.
The first line, from Spencer Street to the end of Bridge Road Richmond via Flinders Street, was opened on 11 November 1885, and all planned lines were built by 1891, the last being the short Windsor-St Kilda Esplanade line, opened 17 October 1891. By then it had about 75 kilometres (47 mi) of double track (103.2 route km or 64.12 route miles) and 1,200 cars and trailers, on 15 routes radiating from the centre of Melbourne to neighbouring suburbs. It was one of the largest cable car systems in the world, comparable with those of San Francisco which had 23 lines, and Chicago which had 66.0 km of double track.With the exception of the Northcote tramway, which was privately built and managed, the infrastructure of the network was built by the Melbourne Tramway Trust, which consisted of representatives of the 12 local councils served by the system. The trust bought land, laid the tracks, and built the cable winding houses. The Melbourne Tramway & Omnibus Company (MTOC) provided the trams and operated the services from 1885 to 1916 under an exclusive 30-year franchise arrangement with the Victorian Government. MTOC had been founded by Francis Boardman Clapp, an American emigrant, who had purchased the Victorian rights to the patents of the cable system developed by Andrew Hallidie. George Smith Duncan, who had built the Roslyn cable tramway in Dunedin, New Zealand, was the engineer in charge of the development of the Melbourne cable network.On the expiration of the MTOC's franchise in 1916, the cable tram network was transferred to the Victorian Government, and then passed to the government-owned Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board (MMTB) on 1 November 1919. The Northcote tramway was transferred to the MMTB on 20 February 1920.Although the first electric tram service was introduced in 1889, and ran for seven years between the outer Melbourne suburbs of Box Hill and Doncaster, the electric tram network did not seriously commence until 1906, when the Victorian Railways built an ""Electric Street Railway"" from St Kilda railway station to Brighton, and The North Melbourne Electric Tramway & Lighting Company built an electric tramway towards Essendon from the terminus of the cable system. From 1924 the cable tram lines were progressively converted to electric traction. The last Melbourne cable tram ran on 26 October 1940, on the Northcote to Bourke Street route.


== Cable tram routes ==


=== Richmond Line (1885-1927) ===
The Richmond line opened on 11 November 1885, and ran between Hawthorn Bridge and City (Spencer Street). The line was converted to electric traction in stages. The line was at first truncated to Swanston Street on 15 May 1927, the rest of the line closing on 29 June 1927. The converted line between Swanston Street and Spencer Street opened on 14 July 1927. The section between Swanston Street and Simpson Street opened on 17 September 1927, and the rest of the line to Hawthorn Bridge opened later that year on 4 December, connecting with the Church Street line and the Burwood Road line, which were already in operation. This conversion enabled Mont Albert and East Kew trams to reach the city directly. The powerhouse was located on Bridge Road, at Hoddle Street, and has since been demolished to provide for a left-turn lane. The remains of the Richmond cable tram depot now form part of the Amora Hotel, near Hawthorn Bridge.


=== North Fitzroy Line (1886-1930) ===
The North Fitzroy line opened on 2 October 1886, and ran between North Fitzroy and City (Collins Street). The line was converted to electric traction in stages. The North Fitzroy Line was truncated to Brunswick Street on 14 September 1929. The line was eventually fully closed on 12 July 1930. The Collins Street section was converted to electric traction and opened on 8 December 1929. The line between Brunswick Street and North Fitzroy was reopened on 26 October 1930. This conversion enabled a direct route for West Preston and East Preston electric trams to reach the city, rather than using the Holden Street line. The powerhouse was located on the north-east corner of Victoria Parade and Brunswick Street. The car shed was located at Holden Street near the North Fitzroy terminus.


=== Victoria Bridge Line (1886-1929) ===
The Victoria Bridge line opened on 22 November 1886, and ran between Victoria Bridge and City (Collins Street). The Victoria Bridge line was closed on 13 July 1929 for conversion to electric traction between Victoria Bridge and Brunswick Street. This section reopened on 15 September 1929, providing a second route for East Kew and Mont Albert electric trams to reach the city (along with Bridge Road). The rest of the Collins Street line was converted to electric traction and reopened on 8 December 1929. The powerhouse was located on the north-east corner of Victoria Parade and Brunswick Street. The car shed was located on Victoria Street near the Victoria Bridge terminus.


=== Clifton Hill Line (1887-1940) ===
The Clifton Hill line opened on 10 August 1887, and ran between Clifton Hill and City (Bourke Street). When the Clifton Hill - Northcote line opened in 1890, it interchanged with the Clifton Hill line at its southern terminus. Passengers initially had to physically walk between the two lines for a through service. When the Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board took over the line in 1925, the two lines were connected together and a through-service was established between Northcote and the city (Bourke Street). The combined Clifton Hill/Northcote line was among the last cable lines to close (along with the Nicholson Street line) on 26 October 1940. Initially, the MMTB replaced the line with buses. Within a few years, it was noticed that the bus route were unsuccessful at coping with the high demand of the routes, so conversion of the Northcote line to electric traction was scheduled to take place right after World War II ended. However, it was not until 26 September 1955 that the Northcote/Clifton Hill route finally reopened. The powerhouse was located on the south-east corner of Nicholson and Gertrude Streets. The car shed was located on Queens Parade near the Clifton Hill terminus.


=== Nicholson Street Line (1887-1940) ===
The Nicholson Street line opened on 30 August 1887, and ran between Nicholson Street and City (Bourke Street). The Nicholson Street line was among the last cable lines to close (along with the Northcote line) on 26 October 1940. Initially, the MMTB replaced the line with buses. Within a few years, it was noticed that the bus route were unsuccessful at coping with the high demand of the routes, so conversion of the Northcote line to electric traction was scheduled to take place right after World War II ended. However, it wasn't until 8 April 1956 that the Nicholson Street route finally reopened. The powerhouse building still exists, and is located on the south-east corner of Nicholson and Gertrude Streets. The car shed was located on Nicholson Street near the Nicholson Street terminus.


=== Brunswick Line (1887-1936) ===
The Brunswick line opened on 1 October 1887, and ran between Brunswick and City (Elizabeth Street). The Brunswick line was converted to electric traction in stages. The line was first truncated to Victoria Street on 29 September 1935. It was further truncated to Leonard Street, Parkville on 17 November 1935. The Brunswick Line was finally closed on 11 January 1936. The powerhouse was located on the north-west corner of Brunswick Road and Black Street. The car shed was located near the Moreland Road terminus.


=== Collingwood Line (1887-1939) ===
The Collingwood line opened on 21 December 1887, and initially ran between Collingwood and City (Lonsdale Street). When the Prahran line opened in 1888, the Collingwood line operated through-routed services to Prahran. When the Swanston Street line was truncated back to Princes Bridge on 26 December 1925 for electrification, the Collingwood and North Carlton lines were truncated back to Lonsdale Street. The line was finally closed on 15 April 1939, being converted into a bus service. The powerhouse was located on the north side of Johnston Street, near Brunswick Street. The car shed was located near the Johnston Street Bridge terminus.


=== Brighton Road Line (1888-1925) ===
The Brighton Road line opened on 11 October 1888, and originally ran between Brighton Road and City (Swanston Street). The initial city terminus was at Flinders Street, but this was extended northwards towards Queensberry Street on 20 January 1889. The trams operated along Brighton Road, High Street (now just St Kilda Road), St Kilda Road and Swanston Street from Brunning Street, Balaclava to Queensberry Street, Carlton. The line was truncated from Queensberry Street to Lonsdale Street on 11 February 1924 to allow the electric trams from the North to terminate in the city. Following this point, Brighton Road trams were through-routed to North Melbourne via Lonsdale Street. The Brighton Road tram line fully closed for electrification on 26 December 1925, but the section between City Road and Domain Road remained for Toorak and Prahran trams to use. An electrified line from Lonsdale Street to Brighton Road was completed on 29 August 1926. Both the powerhouse and car shed were located on the south-east corner of St Kilda Road and Bromby Street.


=== Prahran Line (1888-1926) ===
The Prahran line opened on 26 October 1888, and ran between Prahran and City (Swanston Street). All Prahran line trams were through-routed to Collingwood via Lonsdale Street. The line ran along Chapel Street from Carlisle Street and Toorak Road where it met the Toorak line, along Toorak Road, Park Street and Domain Road to St Kilda Road where it met the Brighton Road line. Trams then ran via St Kilda Road and Swanston Street to Lonsdale Street where trams continued onto Collingwood. The line was truncated to City Road on 26 December 1925, when the Swanston Street line was closed for electrification. The line was further truncated back to Domain Road on 12 January 1926, when the St Kilda Road line was being converted to electric traction. The rest of the line was closed on 28 August 1926. However, Toorak trams still used the line between Domain Road and Chapel Street until October 1 later that year. The powerhouse and the car shed were both located on the north-west corner of Toorak Road and Chapel Street.


=== North Carlton Line (1889-1939) ===
The North Carlton line opened on 9 February 1889, and ran between North Carlton and City (Lonsdale Street). In 1897, the North Carlton service began running through-routed services to St Kilda Beach. The line was closed on 1 August 1936, being replaced by a bus service, though the Collingwood line continued to use the section of track between Rathdowne Street and Lonsdale Street until it closed on 15 April 1939. Both the powerhouse and the car shed were located at the south-west corner of Rathdowne and Park Streets.


=== Toorak Line (1889-1926) ===
The Toorak line opened on 15 February 1889, and ran between Toorak and City (Swanston Street). The initial city terminus was at Flinders Street, but this was extended northwards towards Queensberry Street on 20 January 1889. The line was truncated from Queensberry Street to Lonsdale Street on 11 February 1924 to allow the electric trams from the North to terminate in the city. The line was truncated to City Road on 26 December 1925, when the Swanston Street line was closed for electrification. The line was further truncated back to Domain Road on 12 January 1926, when the St Kilda Road line was being converted to electric traction. The rest of the line was finally closed on 1 October 1926. Both the car shed and the powerhouse located on the north-west corner of Toorak Road and Chapel Street.


=== North Melbourne Line (1890-1935) ===
The North Melbourne Line opened on 3 March 1890, and ran between Flemington Bridge and City (Elizabeth Street). Trams initially terminated at Flinders Street, but due to congestion, the line was diverted at Lonsdale Street and through-routed to Brighton Road on 11 February 1924. The section between Flemington Bridge and Abbotsford Street was closed for electric conversion on 18 July 1925, which was first section cable line in Melbourne to close. The rest of the line closed for conversion to electric traction on 20 July 1935, though the Brunswick Line continued to use the Elizabeth Street section until 28 September 1935. The powerhouse was located on the west corner of Queensberry and Abbotsford Streets. The car shed was located was located near the Flemington Bridge terminus, but later was moved to Victoria Street, near the intersection of Howard Street after the Flemington Bridge section of the line was closed.


=== West Melbourne Line (1890-1935) ===
The West Melbourne line opened on 18 April 1890, and ran between West Melbourne and City (Elizabeth Street). The entire line was closed on 20 July 1935, being replaced by buses, though the Elizabeth Street section of the line was used by the Brunswick Line for a few months after until it too closed on 28 September 1935. The powerhouse was located at the south-west corner of Queensberry Street and Abbotsford Street. The car shed for the West Melbourne line was always shared with the North Melbourne line, first using the Flemington Bridge car shed and later using the Victoria Street car shed from 18 July 1925 onwards.


=== South Melbourne Line (1890-1937) ===
The South Melbourne opened on 17 June 1890, and ran between South Melbourne and City (Collins Street). Initially, the city terminus was located on Gisborne Street at Victoria Parade, but after the Collins Street line was closed for electrification on 14 September 1929, the South Melbourne line was truncated back to Market Street. Eventually, the line entire line closed for electrification on 13 July 1937, but the electric line instead ran to the city via Spencer Street, the City Road section being abandoned. The powerhouse was located on the south side of City Road, near Cecil Street. The car shed was located near the South Melbourne terminus on Victoria Avenue.


=== Port Melbourne Line (1890-1937) ===
The Port Melbourne line opened on 20 June 1890, and ran between Port Melbourne and City (Collins Street). Initially, the city terminus was located on Gisborne Street at Victoria Parade, but after the Collins Street line was closed for electrification on 14 September 1929, the Port Melbourne line was truncated back to Market Street. Eventually, the line entire line closed on 13 July 1937, being replaced by a bus service. The powerhouse located on the south side of City Road, near Cecil Street. The car shed was located on Beaconsfield Parade near the Port Melbourne terminus.


=== Windsor - St Kilda Line (1891-1925) ===
The Windsor - St Kilda line opened on 17 October 1891, and ran between Windsor Railway Station and St Kilda Beach. It was the final cable tram line to open, but was also the first major line to close for electrification on 29 August 1925. The powerhouse was located on the north side of Wellington Street, near Marlton Crescent. The car shed was located near the St Kilda terminus on Acland Street.


=== Clifton Hill - Northcote Line (1890-1940) ===
The Clifton Hill - Northcote line was opened by the Clifton Hill to Northcote & Preston Tramway Company on 18 February 1890, and was Melbourne's only privately built and operated cable tramway. It ran between the northern terminus of the Clifton Hill line, and Dundas Street, Northcote. Early in its existence, the line struggled financially. Passengers initially had to physically walk to the Clifton Hill line for a through service to the city. When the Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board took over the line in 1925, the two lines were connected together and a through-service was established between Northcote and the city (Bourke Street).

1858 United States House of Representatives election in Florida,"The 1858 United States House of Representatives election in Florida was held on Monday, October 4, 1858 to elect the single United States Representative from the state of Florida, one from the state's single at-large congressional district, to represent Florida in the 36th Congress. The election coincided with the elections of other offices, including various state and local elections.
The winning candidate would serve a two-year term in the United States House of Representatives from March 4, 1859, to March 4, 1861.


== Candidates ==


=== Democratic ===


==== Nominee ====
George Sydney Hawkins, incumbent U.S. representative


=== Independent Democratic ===


==== Declared ====
John Westcott, former Surveyor General of Florida


== Campaign ==
This election was held in the middle of the presidency of James Buchanan, with tensions between free states of the North and slave states of the South growing to the point of irreparability. Both the Whig Party and the Know Nothing Party had already collapsed, leaving no true opposition to the Democratic Party in Florida. Hawkins was very popular in the former Whig stronghold of Pensacola, bringing the populous city firmly into the Democratic column. Though Hawkins was expected to run unopposed, he was challenged by Westcott, the former surveyor general of Florida and brother of former U.S. senator James Westcott. Westcott, running as an Independent Democrat, was opposed to the corruption in the Florida Democratic Party, perceiving the party's selection of nominees at conventions making the state's politicians open to political patronage. Westcott also promised cheap land to frontier settlers.Westcott performed best in the frontierlands of East Florida and South Florida, where he was very popular due to his role in the Seminole Wars. Despite this, he could not make inroads into West Florida and was crushed in the general election, only receiving 38% of the vote to Hawkins' 62%.

This was the last election before the American Civil War to send a U.S. representative to Congress. An election was held in 1860, but the winner of that race did not serve in Congress as Florida seceded from the Union prior to the start of the 37th Congress. Hawkins withdrew from Congress on January 21, 1861 after Florida had joined the Confederate States of America. This was the last successful congressional election in Florida until 1868.

Duke Daewon,"Duke Daewon or Marquess Daewon (1093–1161), personal name Wang Hyo was a Goryeo Royal Prince as the fifth son of Sukjong of Goryeo and Queen Myeongui.


== LifeIn 1102, he firstly received his name, ""Hyo"" (효, 侾) and was said to especially favored by his father which he said: ==

Prince of the Yeondeok Palace was intelligent and wise from birth, loyal and filial in nature, so now I give you the name ""Hyo"" under a secret order.연덕궁(延德宮)의 왕자인 그대는 나면서부터 총명하고 슬기롭고 성품이 충성되고 효성스러우므로, 이제 밀명(密命)을 내려 효(侾)라는 이름을 지어주노라.
Wang Hyo was then given silverware (은그릇), silk (비단), artillery (포화), grain (곡식), and a saddled horse (안장). The king also said:

Although I have many children, only this child(refer to Hyo) is filial. Since children are supposed to take filial piety as their foundation, they were named ""Hyo"" after adding filial piety next to ""In"".자녀가 비록 많지만 이 아이만이 효자라오. 자식은 효를 근본으로 삼아야 하는 것이므로 사람 인(人)변에 효(孝)를 더한 글자로 이름을 지어준 것이오.
After his father's death, the young prince Hyo lived with his mother in the Yeondeok Palace (연덕궁, 延德宮), which from there he was called as Young Prince of the Yeondeok Palace (연덕궁왕자, 延德宮王子). He formally became a marquess on the 2nd months of 1106 along with received ""2,000 sik-eup"" (2천호 식읍) and ""300 sik-sil"" (3백호 식실). A year later, his brother moved to Seogyeong, ordered Yun Gwan (윤관) and O Yeon-chong (오연총) to conquered the Jurchens while Hyo stayed in the capital to protect the royal family and appointed as Geomgyotaebo (검교태보) in 1108. Then, in 1110, Hyo became Gwanghyogongsin Sutaewi (광효공신 수태위) and was given his mother's residence–Myeongbok Palace (명복궁, 明福宮) during her lifetime under the king's command in 1113. A year later, he became a duke and married the oldest daughter of Duke Yanggan (양간공, 襄簡公) on the 3rd months of 1115, also became a Taebo (태보) in 1122 by received silk (비단), goldware (금은그릇), and horse (말) through Choe Hong-jae (최홍재).However, not long after Yi Ja-gyeom (이자겸) came to the power, both Wang Hyo and Wang Bo were exiled to Gyeongsan-bu (nowadays is Seongju County, North Gyeongsang Province). In 1129, Wang Hyo was able to back to Gaegyeong and his nephew, King Injong made him held his former position again and gave him ""3,500 sik-eup"" (3천5백호 식읍) and ""500 sik-sil"" (5백호 식실), along with a new house, silk (비단), goldware (금은그릇), and horse (말). Four years later, in 1133, his wife passed away. Later on, Wang Hyo died at the age of 69 in 1161 and his mortuary was built at Gwangje Temple (광제사, 廣濟寺). He was given a Posthumous name, Jangpyeong (장평, 莊平) and cremated on the 28th days at the foot of a hill. His remains were placed in ""Inhyobulwon"" (인효불원, 因孝佛院) for a while until his funeral was held at the eastern foot of the Uiryong Mountain on the 11th months.

Droughts occur when precipitation is considerably reduced during the theoretically rainy months of the year.Four types of climatic droughts can be defined: Cantabrian (coyuntural and low-frequence droughts), Iberian (droughts usually affecting the entire Iberian Peninsula, except the Cantabrian façade), southeastern (structural droughts, the mirror opposite of the Cantabrian ones) and Canarian droughts.The drought, along with high winds and fallen cables, is being looked at as a prime causal factor in forest fires.In 2012 Spain experienced the driest period since the 1940s, with rainfall decreased by up to 75%.Most rain in Spain falls in the winter as wet, low-pressure systems coming from the Atlantic Ocean, but a high-pressure system called the Azores high can block these weather fronts coming from the Atlantic Ocean (Carrington, 2022). From 1850 to 1980, the frequency of this high-pressure system, Azores High, was once every seven years. But data has shown that after 1980 the frequency became once every four years. The problem of the Azores high is that it reduces about one third of the monthly rainfall in the winters (Carrington, 2022).  
Since the industrial revolution, the Azores high, which is also called the Gatekeeper of European Rainfall has become more frequent. Research has shown that the Azores High has expanded as the earth has warmed (Tandon, 2022). The expansion of the Azores High will intensify the drought in Portugal and Spain, and it's expected that these two regions will see a 10-20% drop in winter precipitation in upcoming winters.

Noa-name,"A noa-name is a word that replaces a taboo word, generally out of fear that the true name would summon the thing. The term derives from the Polynesian concept of noa, which is the antonym of tapu (from which derives the word taboo) and serves to lift the tapu from a person or object. 
A noa-name is sometimes described as a euphemism, though the meaning is more specific; a noa-name is a non-taboo synonym used to avoid bad luck, and replaces a name considered dangerous. The noa-name may be innocuous or flattering, or it may be more accusatory.


== Examples ==
In the Germanic languages, the word for 'bear' was replaced with a noa-name meaning 'brown': Proto-Germanic *berô, with descendants including Swedish björn, English bear, German Bär and Dutch beer.
In Swedish, the word ulv ('wolf') was replaced by varg ('stranger'). The spirits of the hearth, tomte (corresponding to the Scottish brownie, or the Cornish pixie), were known as nisse, 'dear little relatives'.
In English, the Devil has been referred to by a variety of names (e.g. 'Old Nick', 'Mr. Scratch') to avoid attracting his attention through his name.
In Irish folklore, Fairies are referred to as 'the little people' or 'the good people'.
In Greek legend, the Erinyes (the Furies, the spirits of revenge) were commonly known as the Eumenides ('the benevolent ones'). Additionally, Hades, god of the underworld, was usually referred to with euphemisms like Ploútōn ('the wealthy one') in order to avoid attracting his attention.
In Jewish culture, it is forbidden to speak the name of God (represented as YHWH) and the noa-name adonai, 'my lord', or HaShem, 'the Name', is used instead.
In Finnish, there are several noa-names for karhu (bear), used instead of calling the animal by its name and inadvertently attracting its attention. The word karhu itself is a noa-name, to avoid using the original (and now relatively uncommon) words otso or ohto. (See Finnish mythology.)
To avoid the negative connotations of the left side and left-handedness, most Romance languages created noa-names to avoid Latin sinister: see French gauche, Spanish izquierdo, Romanian stângă. Also Greek created ἀριστερός (aristeros), a derivation from ἄριστος (aristos, ""best"") to avoid λαιός (laios).

La France au travail,"La France au Travail (France at Work) was a pro-German French newspaper which appeared from 30 June 1940 onwards funded by the German embassy in France. It was started as a propaganda initiative in the aftermath of the German occupation to influence left-leaning segments of French public opinion. The Director, Jean Drault, was a French anti-Semite while its editor, Georges Oltramare, was a pro-Nazi Swiss journalist who broadcast on French radio. The extent of German control is evident in that editorial meetings were held directly in the German embassy on the rue de Lille. In style and content, the newspaper mirrored the Communist newspaper L'Humanité except for virulent anti-Semitic and anti-Masonic positions. The newspaper was fairly successful with sales of 92,000 in the first weeks rising to 180,000 by August 1940. Exposure by the clandestine Communist press as well as mainstream French newspapers, however, ensured a steady, and then permanent, decline.

Bob Gormley,"Robert Gormley (August 3, 1918 – December 11, 2003) was an American soccer forward who spent seventeen years in the American Soccer League. He also earned one cap with the U.S. national team in 1954. He was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame in 1989.
Gormley was born and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he began playing youth soccer with the Lighthouse Boys Club before moving to another local club, the McKinley Soccer Club. In 1933, he signed with the Philadelphia German-Americans of the American Soccer League. However, he spent three years with the reserve team before leaving the team in 1936 to sign with the Kensington Blue Bells of the Eastern Pennsylvania League. After only one season, he returned to the German-Americans, where he spent the rest of his career. In 1937, he scored ten goals. In 1944, he scored sixteen goals in nineteen games. In 1947, he scored twelve goals in nineteen games and in 1948, he added another thirteen goals.
He ended his career in 1954 with the German-Americans, now known as Uhrik Truckers after having been purchased by the trucking company during the 1953–1954 season. During his seventeen years with the team, Gormley was captain for twelve. Gormley died in December 2003 at the age of 85.


== National team ==
In 1947, he played two U.S. exhibition games, which are not considered full internationals, against Israel.  In the second of the two games, played on October 14, 1948, Gormley scored a goal in the 4-1 U.S. victory.
Gormley did not play with the full U.S. national team until a meaningless April 3, 1954 victory over Haiti in a World Cup qualifier.  By this game, the U.S. had already failed to qualify for the finals.

Herbert Strudwick,"Herbert Strudwick (28 January 1880 – 14 February 1970) was an English wicket-keeper. His record of 1,493 dismissals is the third-highest by any wicket-keeper in the history of first-class cricket.


== Biography ==
Born in Mitcham, Surrey, Strudwick took to wicket-keeping, apparently on the advice of a local lady, at the age of ten. He first played for Surrey in a few games in 1902, but during his first full season the following year dismissed a record 91 batsmen (71 catches and 20 stumpings) – a feat made more remarkable by the decline of Surrey's top fast bowlers Tom Richardson and William Lockwood and the exceptionally wet weather of that summer. From that time on, Strudwick became regarded as the natural successor to Dick Lilley as England's Test wicket-keeper, and he toured Australia in 1903/1904 without playing a Test.
Continuing his good form, Strudwick maintained his place among the top wicket-keepers right through the 1900s and played his first Test in 1909/1910 against South Africa. In 1911, though overshadowed in county cricket by Kent veteran Fred Huish, Strudwick was chosen as the first-choice wicket-keeper to Australia because of his relative youth and did not disappoint, taking the bowling of Frank Foster and Sydney Barnes with skill. His skill was seen to even greater effect taking Barnes on the matting wickets of South Africa in 1914: with Barnes' bowling bouncing and turning. In the following season, Strudwick's skill was an essential part of Surrey's success in winning the County Championship for the only time during his career. 
After World War I halted county cricket, Strudwick re-established himself in the England side until he retired in 1927 – though he was dropped to improve the batting during the disastrous 1921 series against Armstrong's Australians. Gilbert Jessop said ""Struddy was a specialist"" and ""year after year our most reliable 'stumper'"", but in Test matches that wasn't enough. After his playing days he became a respected coach and for many years was the Surrey scorer.
In his later years Strudwick, renowned for his abstinence from tobacco and alcohol at a time when the health of sportsmen was not taken seriously, wrote many articles about the game in Wisden. The most famous of these is From Dr. Grace to Peter May in the 1959 Wisden, which outlines how Strudwick saw the game both during his career and as a spectator after retiring.
Not much of a batsman, he nonetheless twice added over 100 for the last wicket with Bill Hitch (one of only four pairs with more than one tenth-wicket century stand in first-class cricket). His record of 1,493 dismissals is the third-highest by any wicket-keeper in the history of first-class cricket. He died in Shoreham-by-Sea, Sussex, aged 90.

== Plot ==
Ryohei Arisu is a young man who struggles to connect with his family and spends time hanging out with his friends, Daikichi Karube and Chōta Segawa. Arisu and Chota are often immature and do not try at school, whilst Karube manages a bar and urges the two to get their lives together. The trio are at a train station when they see fireworks so blinding they have to cover their eyes, and when they open them they find themselves back in Karube's bar, which is now abandoned and all of the buildings covered in vegetation. The trio get drunk and play games together, but Karube becomes worried and urges the pair to take things seriously. After stepping into what seems to be an empty festival, they are greeted by Saori Shibuki who tells them that they have already ""entered their game"". The game is 'Three of Clubs' named 'Good Fortune Bad Fortune' where they have to answer obscure questions and if they get it wrong flaming arrows are shot at them. Karube and Shibuki argue, causing Chota to have to guess the answer quickly and have arrows fired at them. The questions continue, and Chota's leg is severely burned, but apart from that all four escape. Shibuki reveals to them that, in Borderland, they must play games to survive, with the number of each game the number of days they have until they have to play another game. Shibuki arrived in the Borderlands several days earlier where she played 'Two of Hearts' and was the only survivor, traumatising her. Due to Chota's injury, Shibuki volunteers to stay behind to tend to him, whilst the other two go into the 'Five of Spades', other players include climber Yuzuha Usagi and sly player Shuntaro Chishiya. Only those four survive the game, with Arisu and Usagi managing to complete it together. Arisu, Karube, Chota and Shibuki enter the 'Seven of Hearts' game where it's revealed only one can survive, the other three all decide sacrifice themselves for Arisu. As Arisu remains in despair, he meets Usagi again, she takes pity on him and they decide to partner up.
The pair begin looking for the 'Beach' which was a place Karube had discovered before his demise. They discover and are forced to join the ranks of the ""Beach"", which is a large hotel inhabited with players run by the ""Mad Hatter"" who wishes to collect all the cards from the game's deck and believes that collecting them would bring them back to their world. Several games later however, the Mad Hatter is killed and the Beach is turned into the game stage for the Ten of Hearts, the final game of the first stage. Following the clearance of the game, the gamemasters reveal themselves and announce a second stage, where they have to compete in games of the face cards to complete the Borderlands.

Polygonum basiramia,"Polygonum basiramia (synonym Polygonella basiramia) is a rare species of flowering plant in the knotweed family known by the common names wireweed, hairy wireweed, purple wireweed, and Florida jointweed. It is endemic to Florida in the United States, where it is limited to the central ridges of the peninsula, including the Lake Wales Ridge. It is threatened by the loss and degradation of its habitat. It is a federally listed endangered species of the United States.


== Description ==
This plant is a perennial herb growing 30 to 80 centimeters tall. The roots of the plant may be much longer than the plant's diameter and spread out under the soil. The wiry stems may branch and may extend beneath the surface of the soil. The plant only has leaves for a short time. They are linear in shape and measure no more than 2 or 3 centimeters in length. The stem and leaves are red to green in color. The plant is gynodioecious, with some individuals producing bisexual flowers and some producing only female. The inflorescence, measuring 1 to 3 centimeters long, contains white to pinkish flowers under 2 millimeters long. Blooming occurs around September and fruit production may last until December. The flowers are pollinated by Perdita polygonellae, a bee which specializes in the plant subsection Polygonella, and wasps of the family Eumenidae. Female plants produce many more seeds than do hermaphrodite plants. The seeds are very tiny, measuring about 7 by 28 micrometers. The species appears to be resistant to the allelopathic chemicals released into the soil by Florida rosemary.


== Taxonomy ==
The species was first described in 1820 by John Kunkel Small as Delopyrum basiramia. It was later placed in the genus Polygonella (under the name Polygonella basiramia), but in 2015, following a series of molecular phylogenetic studies, this genus was subsumed into Polygonum.


== Distribution and habitat ==
This plant is a member of the Florida scrub plant community. It occurs in scrub dominated by Florida rosemary, sand pine, other pines, and oaks. The soil is almost entirely composed of sand and it holds little water or nutrients. The plant occurs in openings in the scrub which are maintained by periodic wildfires. Other plants in this habitat include Calamintha ashei, Cnidoscolus stimulosus, Eryngium cuneifolium, Euphorbia floridana, Hypericum cumulicola, Lechea cernua, Licania michauxii, Paronychia chartacea, Polanisia tenuifolia, Polygonum polygama, Selaginella arenicola, and Stipulicida setacea.


== Conservation ==
Threats to this species include the destruction of its habitat during the conversion to residential and agricultural property, particularly citrus groves. Off-road vehicles are a threat to the habitat. Fire suppression may have a negative effect on this plant, which grows in open gaps in a fire-maintained ecosystem, but the species appears to be less dependent on fire than many other Florida scrub endemics.Many plants in this altered, fragmented region are rare and endangered. Wireweed is one of the more abundant of these, and it can be common in some local areas. As of 2010 there were 119 extant occurrences of the plant for an estimated total exceeding one million individuals. However, it is limited to a very endangered habitat type, putting it in danger of decline.

Big Boy (song),"""Big Boy"" (also known as ""I'm a Big Boy Now"") is the debut single by the American family band the Jackson 5 and the first song performed by a then nine-year-old Michael Jackson. ""Big Boy"" was released by Steeltown Records, a record company in Gary, Indiana, in January 1968. After it was released, the song played on radio stations in the Chicago-Gary area and was a local hit. Beginning in March 1968, Steeltown Records sold thousands of copies of ""Big Boy"" nationally through a distribution deal with Atlantic Records, but it was neither a critical nor commercial success. The Jackson family were delighted with the outcome nonetheless. The Jackson 5 would release a second single on the Steeltown label, titled ""We Don't Have to Be Over 21 (To Fall in Love)"", before signing with Motown Records in Detroit, on July 26, 1968. The group played instruments on many of their Steeltown compositions, including ""Big Boy"". The group's recordings for Steeltown Records were thought to be lost, but were said to be rediscovered more than 25 years later. These recordings were remastered and released in 1995, with ""Big Boy"" as the promotional lead single.


== Steeltown Records ==
The Jackson 5 began their career performing at talent contests, which they would often win. During a performance at Beckman Junior High in Gary, Indiana, the group were brought to the attention of Gordon Keith — a singer, record producer, and a founder-owner of Steeltown Records, a small record company located in Gary. Keith, Steeltown Records president and secretary in 1967, signed the Jackson Five to six-month contract with him (each Steeltown Records co-owner individually discovered, signed, managed, and received any profit for each signed individual or group, using Steeltown Records (Steeltown label) as an umbrella to promote name recognition) in November of that year, producing and releasing ""Big Boy"" on January 31, 1968.The band recorded with their instruments and a backing group on the weekends. Michael Jackson sang lead vocals on the majority of the tracks beginning with ""Big Boy"" in 1967, which took a few hours to record at Sunny Sawyers recording studio in South Chicago. ""Big Boy"" was written by songwriter Eddie Silvers, a Chicago musician. According to legend, the group were paid three cents for each record sold, which was equally split among the five brothers and their drummer. The group's first single ""Big Boy"", was backed with the B-side ""You've Changed"", written by Jesse Reese. This song was later re-recorded for inclusion on their debut album Diana Ross Presents The Jackson 5. ""The Jackson Five Plus Johnny"" (Johnny Jackson on drums, no relation) would go on to perform ""Big Boy"" and other songs locally throughout the Gary and South Chicago area before moving to California in 1969.The Jackson family gathered around a radio to hear the song broadcast for the first time from WWCA-AM 1270 radio in Gary. Michael Jackson — who was 9 years old at the time — said of the experience, ""[the family] all laughed and hugged one another. We felt we had arrived."" The single ""Big Boy"" did not appear on any of Billboard's music charts but sold in excess of 10,000 copies.The Jackson Five would release a second and final single through Steeltown Records — ""We Don't Have To Be Over 21 (to Fall in Love)"". The two singles were to be supported by an eleven track studio album but it was never released. The group auditioned at Motown in Detroit on July 23, 1968, and signed an initial deal with Motown Records on July 26. However, as the group's Steeltown contract had not yet expired, the new contract could not be fully executed until March 11, 1969. Motown Records tried to get the group out of their Steeltown contract with Keith, and ultimately succeeded with a financial settlement.


=== After Steeltown ===
In 1994, the master tapes to ""Big Boy"" were thought to be lost (Keith kept his 1967 Jackson Five master tapes of ""Big Boy"" in a bank vault). Jackson family friend Ben Brown (and former Steeltown co-owner) claimed he found the tapes in his parents' ""kitchen pantry"". In 1995, Brown reissued the record on the Inverted Records label — a week before Michael Jackson's HIStory album was issued. He also remastered the song, selling it by mail order, along with an instrumental version, in a limited edition package consisting of a compact disc and cassette tape — the package could be purchased at a cost of approximately $30. The reissue of ""Big Boy"" was promoted with a music video.In May 2009, Gordon Keith put items from steeltown era up for auction, including ""a sizable number of mint-condition copies of 'Big Boy'"" (#681) in 45 rpm format and 100 copies of ""We Don't Have To Be Over 21 (to Fall in Love)"". Keith stated, ""I could use the money... I got these guys off the ground... I didn't truly get real money for it"".


== Recording discovery ==
Onederful! RecordsIn August 2009, the Leaners’ children of former Chicago One-derful! Records owners George and Ernie Leaner, discovered for the first time, a master recording in the One-derful! archives of The Jackson Five recording ""I'm A Big Boy Now"" (""Big Boy"") dated July 13, 1967. This recording predates Keith's Steeltown 1967 recording of ""Big Boy"" (in 1967, the Leaner brothers had told Keith, that they did not have any Jackson Five recordings).

Banksia viscida,"Banksia viscida, commonly known as sticky dryandra, is a small shrub known only from four laterite hills in semi-arid inland Western Australia. Known until recently as Dryandra viscida, it is thought to be rare but not threatened.


== Description ==
Banksia viscida grows as a small, dense, rounded shrub no more than 1 metre (3 ft) high. Its leaves are 15 to 35 centimetres (5.9 to 14 in) long and 5 to 10 millimetres (0.20 to 0.39 in) wide; they are pinnatifid, with 25 to 75 triangular lobes on each side. Flowers are golden yellow, and occur in dome-shaped heads of 40 to 55 flowers, up to 4 centimetres (2 in) across. After flowering, the heads may develop up to several follicles each, which contain two or sometimes one seed.


== Taxonomy ==

Early collections of this species include specimens collected from South Ironcap by Keith Alcock and John Stanley Beard, and specimens collected from west of Digger Rocks by Stephen Hopper. The type specimen was collected by Alex George from Hatter Hill on 30 July 1969. For some time prior to formal publication it was recognised as a new species, and was referred to by the interim name Dryandra sp. 16 (A.S.George 9446).George published a formal description of the species in 1996 in Nuytsia 10(3). He placed it in the genus Dryandra, subgenus Dryandra, series Gymnocephalae, and gave it the specific epithet ""viscida"" from the Latin viscidus (""sticky""), in reference to its sticky involucral bracts. Thus its full name was, for a time, Dryandra viscida A.S.George.Early in 2007, Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele transferred all Dryandra taxa to Banksia. The current name for this species is therefore Banksia viscida (A.S.George) A.R.Mast & K.R.Thiele. As an interim measure, Mast and Thiele placed all but one Dryandra taxon in Banksia ser. Dryandra.


== Distribution and habitat ==
Banksia viscida is known only from four lateritic rises on the border of the Coolgardie and Mallee biogeographic regions; these are Digger Rocks, Middle Ironcap, South Ironcap and Hatter Hill. It occurs there in gravelly soil amongst thick scrub. The area is hot and dry, with mean annual rainfall of 300 to 350 millimetres (12 to 14 in), and up to 90 days above 30 °C (86 °F).


== Ecology ==

Like most other Proteaceae, B. viscida has proteoid roots, roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, thus allowing nutrient uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. It lacks a lignotuber, so is killed by bushfire. However it is adapted to release its seed following a fire, so populations regenerate rapidly.It has been given a rating of ""Priority Three - Poorly Known Taxa"" on Western Australia's Department of Environment and Conservation's Declared Rare and Priority Flora List, meaning that it appears to be rare but not threatened, but further surveys are required.


== Cultivation ==
The species is little known in cultivation. It germinates well, but is difficult to establish and slow to grow. It has been grown successfully in loamy soil in northern Victoria, but attempts to grow it in the sandy soils of Perth have failed. Tony Cavanagh and Margaret Pieroni suggest that as a compact shrub with attractive foliage it would be best suited to a small garden. It requires warm, dry weather with near full sun, and heavy well drained soils. It is hardy to drought and frost.

Sugar Mountain Farm,"Sugar Mountain Farm is a 70 acres (28 ha) family-operated pig farm in West Topsham, Vermont with approximately 200-400 pastured-raised pigs. The pigs are fed acid whey from a nearby dairy farm, apple pomace leftovers from a nearby cider facility, vegetables, and spent barley from a brewery as opposed to grain.The company has stated that it uses ""natural farming methods"", also known as permaculture. They only use antibiotics if a pig gets sick. The farm does not use castration to control boar taint, relying on other methods such as selective breeding, diet, and pasturing males away from females. They raised sheep and pigs until 2009, when the farm focused on pork due to lower demand for lamb and wool.As of 2010, the farm had been raising pigs for 12 pig generations in two herds of 40 sows and four boars.  The herds comprise crosses of several heritage breeds.  Most are Yorkshire crossed with Berkshires, Large Black, Tamworth, Hampshire and Gloucester Old Spots.Initially the farmers had to transport six pigs at a time 150 miles (240 km) to the nearest butcher. Using funding from friends, family members, their own savings, a community-supported agriculture programs of pre-buys by customers and $33,000 from a Kickstarter campaign, they began building a slaughterhouse on the property around 2009, as a do-it-yourself project.  Sugar Mountain Farm started butcher shop operations October 15, 2015 under Vermont state inspection.

Japanese grosbeak,"The Japanese grosbeak (Eophona personata) or Ikaru is a finch native to the East Palearctic. It is also sometimes referred to as the Japanese or masked hawfinch due to superficial similarities to the well-known Eurasian species.


== Description ==
This is a large finch, with a reported weight of 80 g (2.8 oz) (for a single male) and a length of 18 to 23 cm (7.1 to 9.1 in). Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 10.2 to 11.7 cm (4.0 to 4.6 in), the tail is 8.3 to 9.5 cm (3.3 to 3.7 in) and the culmen is 2.1 to 2.6 cm (0.83 to 1.02 in). The signature feature of the Japanese grosbeak is its large, pointed bright yellow bill. The adult grosbeak has a large black marking extending from the nape to the chin and ear-coverts to the neck. The side of the neck is a contrasting pale whitish grey. The bird's underside is a more dull grey. The back is greyish-brown while the flanks are washed with a gingery or tawny-brown colour. The wings and tail are black but for a white patch on the inner-coverts and band of white in the middle of the primaries, which is visible in flight. Juveniles are a duller grey overall with no black on head. The subspecies, E. p. magnostris is slightly larger than the nominate race. It is also generally paler in tone with a smaller white patch the on primaries.
Among the vocalizations issued by Japanese grosbeaks include a short but hard tak tak note given in flight. The song of these birds consists of a series of four flutey whistles.


== Ecology ==
The alternate subspecies (E. p. magnostris) is completely migratory, breeding around the Amur, Ural and Manchurian regions and then wintering down in Hebei and Beijing, uncommonly ranging south towards North Korea. The nominate race occurs in Japan from Hokkaido to Kyushu and is not as seasonally migratory but does wander considerably during winter, largely in pursuit of food sources. The Japanese grosbeak is locally common, occasionally being abundant around prime feeding areas. It occurs in deciduous or mixed forests. More commonly, it is a bird of valleys rather than hillsides. This species also turns up in woods and groves of oak and birch and well-wooded parks and gardens. The species may winter on the edge of cultivated areas. The Japanese grosbeak usually occurs in pairs or small flocks. Behaviourally, it can be deceptively secretive, often staying hidden in foliage near the tree canopy. However, its location may regularly be betrayed by its voice. Mostly, the grosbeak feeds on variety of seeds and insects. During winter, they mainly live on cedar nuts, but also will feed on birch seeds and berries. During the summer, they become largely insectivorous and regularly eat caterpillars and beetles.

Moine Mhòr,"Moine Mhòr (""Great Moss"" in Scottish Gaelic) encompasses a large area of raised bog in the Kilmartin Glen area of Argyll and Bute, Scotland. As well as raised bog there are areas of saltmarsh, brackish grassland, alder carr, fen and woodland, and the variety of habitats at Moine Mhòr provide important habitats for a variety of animal and plant species. The area was declared a national nature reserve (NNR) in 1987, and is now owned and managed by NatureScot. According to NatureScot lowland raised bogs like Moine Mhòr are some of the rarest and most threatened natural wildlife habitats in Europe, due to removal of peat, afforestation and reclamation of farmland.Around 8,000 people visit the Moine Mhòr NNR every year, with the reserve being popular with local people and school groups, as well as tourists visiting the nearby attractions of Kilmartin Glen and the Crinan Canal. A 600 m nature trail has been constructed at the northern edge of the reserve; other visitor facilities include a car park and picnic area.


== History ==
The Moine Mhòr began to form after the last ice age some 10,000 years ago, as rising sea levels covered the area in impermeable marine clay. The land began to rise as the glaciers melted due to post-glacial rebound, and a shallow estuary formed at the mouth of the River Add. A freshwater loch formed over the Moine Mhòr, separated from the sea by an area of saltmarsh. About 5,500 years ago sea levels fell further, and sphagnum mosses started to colonise the area, which was kept damp due to the impermeable clay. Over time layers of peat were laid down, leading to the Moine Mhòr as it is today.Moine Mhòr lies to the west of Kilmartin Glen, one of the most important prehistoric landscapes in Scotland, however the boggy conditions prevented these prehistoric people from living or farming on the moss. It is nonetheless likely that they would have used the bog to cut peat for fuel, and to collect berries and lichens for food, drinks, dyes, and potions. Core samples have shown that the bog was regularly burnt to maintain open grazing for animals. The Crinan Canal, built immediately to the south of the Moine Mhòr between 1794 and 1801, led to a decline in peat cutting, as coal from the Glasgow area began to replace peat as fuel. Landowners began to ""reclaim"" the bog by drainage in order to commence agriculture. Controlled burning of the unimproved sections of the bog continued, however the focus shifted from grazing to sporting interests, with the aim of encouraging red grouse for shooting parties. Around 1980 approximately 100 ha of conifer plantation were planted at Moine Mhor. In order to prevent the disappearance of more of the blanket bog, the Nature Conservancy Council (NCC - the predecessor body of NatureScot) decided to purchase 500 ha of land and declared the area a national nature reserve. Since taking ownership NatureScot have attempted to reverse historical drainage of the bog by the damming of drainage ditches, with over 190 dams having been constructed by 2017. This has led to a rise in the water table, and allowed the sphagnum mosses to regenerate. NatureScot has also taken action to remove trees and scrubs in order to maintain the area as a raised bog.


== Flora and fauna ==
Sphagnum mosses are the key plants in the formation of a raised bog and nine species have been recorded at Moine Mhòr NNR. The marginal habitats mean that there is also a diverse flowering plant community, including purple heath orchid, round-leaved sundew, bog myrtle and bog asphodel. The plant life of the bog helps supports many types of invertebrates, including the marsh fritillary (one of Europe’s most threatened butterfly species), which lives on devil's-bit scabious, a plant of the drier fringes of the bog. The large heath butterfly, a UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species is also present, and the reserve hosts many species of dragonflies.235 bird species have been recorded at the reserve, with the bog itself supporting species such as curlew and meadow pipit, whilst redshank, snipe and oystercatcher breed on the saltmarsh areas. The reserve hosts an important population of breeding hen harriers; other raptors present include short-eared owls, which also breed here occasionally, whilst ospreys can be seen fishing along the river and at the estuary. Otters regularly visit the watercourses, and roe and sika deer also visit the Moine Mhòr.


== Conservation designations ==
The national nature reserve is classified as a Category IV protected area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Moine Mhòr also holds other national and international conservation designations for its natural heritage, being both a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Area of Conservation (SAC): these designations cover a wider area than the NNR (c. 11.5 km2). Moine Mhòr lies within the Knapdale national scenic area (NSA)

Israeli Educational Television,"The Israeli Educational Television (also known as IETV, Hebrew: הטלוויזיה החינוכית הישראלית, HaTelevizia HaKhinuchít HaIsraelit or just חינוכית - Hinuchit) was a state-owned public terrestrial television network which used to concentrate on producing and broadcasting programs for school children. The first Israeli children's show, featuring Kishkashta, aired on Channel 1 in the 1970s and 1980s. However, since the 1980s, IETV began to produce TV magazines and programs aimed at adults and senior citizens.


== History ==

IETV was established in 1965 as a joint project of the Israeli Ministry of Education and the Rothschild Foundation. It was the first television station in Israel, and its first broadcast, launched in March 1966, was the first television transmission in Israel. In those days the Israeli government was reluctant to introduce television transmissions claiming it would lead to cultural decadence. However limited broadcasts as an instructional tool were approved.
The first transmission was launched on 24 March 1966. Levi Eshkol, the Israeli prime minister, pressed a symbolic button to mark the beginning of the transmission. Lord Victor Rothschild delivered a speech on behalf of the Rothschild Fund. The then-called Instructional Television Trust opened its regular transmission with televised broadcasts of Mathematics, Biology and English classes. 60 television sets were distributed to 32 schools to receive the first broadcasts and comment on their quality. As from the early 1970s and until the early 1990s it was known as the Instructional Television Centre.
Within its first year of existence the IETV expanded its infrastructure, and began to broadcast nationwide. On 2 May 1968, it began to share its channel with the newly established IBA's general public channel. The two organizations would share a single channel for many years to come, the only Israeli television channel until the late 1980s, when the experimental transmissions of the Israeli Channel 2 started.When the then Channel 2 commercial channel launched officially in 1993, IETV received dedicated slots with commercial inserts .
On June 6, 1995 IETV launched another 24/7 dedicated new channel ""Educational 23"" which ran exclusively on cable television and from 2001 also on YES - Israel's only DTH (pay satellite television).
The station has remained an autonomous unit of the Ministry of Education, and broadcast more than 200 hours of programming every week.In December 2013, the channel re-branded as Educational (simply Hinuchit, in Hebrew), and focused on a new children and educational programming schedule from 5:00am Israel Time, as well as adult educational schedule from 8:00pm Israel Time. The channel also has started to upload its shows to their official YouTube channel even before they broadcast on television.
Following a reform in public broadcasting initiated by the government and approved by the Knesset in the summer of 2014, the Israeli Broadcasting Authority was replaced in 2017 by the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation (aka KAN).
On 14 August 2018, the Educational Network was shut down and has been replaced by a new kids and youth channel Kan Educational, a part of the Israel Public Broadcasting Corporation.

== Plot ==
Astra Louge, Gideon and Spooner Cruz make their way to the highway when they find a barn with pie. Spooner and Astra argue whether Gideon should steal a pie. This leads to Gideon struggling with making decisions and collapsing. Unable to reboot her, Astra uses her powers to send herself and Spooner into Gideon's mind. Inside, they meet a British-accented memory of the former Legends member Jefferson Jackson, who is monitoring Gideon's damaged subconsciousness.
Bishop then is woken up from being knocked out by an AVA clone. Bishop then is able to access a copy of Gideon he made while he was with the Legends.
Back in Gideon's mind, Jax informs Astra that Gideon is losing her memories, so Astra and Spooner go through and help her regain memories by re-experiencing them. They first visit the day which the Legends kidnap Spooner. They are then sent back to the early days of the Legends where Gideon prevents a fight between Sara Lance, Ray Palmer, Carter Hall, and Leonard Snart. They experience a memory re-encountering Martin Stein. They discover the existence of a virus of herself who does not want to be human.
They then enter a memory where Rip Hunter reveals that the Waverider only has one bathroom. As the argument continues Gideon follows the virus pretending to be Rip Hunter. The virus then corrupts her memories, who then forces her to re-experience the deaths of several Legends, and reveals that Rip had reprogrammed her to protect the Legends and learn from them.
The virus uses several Legends members to attack Gideon, Astra, and Spooner. After defeating and un-corrupting the memories. Spooner and Astra show Gideon happier memories, convincing her to embrace her humanity and take control of the virus. She is comforted by several of the Legends, accepts her role as a member of the team and wakes up.
Back in Vancouver, the past Bishop has dreams of his future self and the Legends from the alien invasion in 1925. He finds a copy of Gideon that he downloaded and resets her memories, intending to use her against the Legends.


== Production ==


=== Development ===
In July 2021, Legends of Tomorrow cast member Caity Lotz announced that she had begun preparation to direct the series' 100th episode. While the episode's title was initially announced as ""WVRDR_ERROR_100 <Oest-of-th3-Gs.gid30n> notFound"", it was later amended to ""wvrdr_error_100<oest-of-th3-gs.gid30n> not found"". The episode, which is the seventh season's third, was written by showrunner Phil Klemmer and Matthew Maala.


=== Writing ===
Klemmer explained the episode's structure: ""The whole episode really is predicated on memory and Gideon's memory [...] It occurred to us, in being forced to do a retrospective of 100 episodes, that Gideon, really, is the only person who saw everything"". The episode also features a ""little bit of a reprise of a musical theater number"".


=== Casting ===
Main cast members Caity Lotz as Sara Lance / White Canary, Tala Ashe as Zari Tarazi, Jes Macallan as Ava Sharpe, Olivia Swann as Astra Logue, Adam Tsekhman as Gary Green, Shayan Sobhian as Behrad Tarazi, Lisseth Chavez as Esperanza ""Spooner"" Cruz, Amy Louise Pemberton as Gideon, and Nick Zano as Nate Heywood all return to star in the episodes from previous seasons. Many former main cast members return as guest stars; including Brandon Routh as Ray Palmer / Atom, Victor Garber as Martin Stein, Franz Drameh as Jefferson Jackson, Arthur Darvill as Rip Hunter, Courtney Ford as Nora Darhk, Wentworth Miller as Leonard Snart / Captain Cold, and Falk Hentschel as Carter Hall / Hawkman. Additionally, Raffi Barsoumian guest stars as Bishop. Routh returned for the episode, explaining that when he exited the series as a regular, it was a bad decision, while adding as a reason the need to show a more mature version of the character. Klemmer said he was interested in Ciara Renée, Dominic Purcell and Casper Crump reprising their roles as Kendra Saunders / Hawkgirl, Mick Rory / Heatwave and Vandal Savage, but ultimately did not cast them.


=== Filming ===
Filming began on August 5, and ended later in the month.


== Release ==
""wvrdr_error_100<oest-of-th3-gs.gid30n> not found"" premiered on October 27, 2021, on The CW. It was watched by 0.51 million viewers with a 0.1 share among adults aged 18 to 49.


== Critical reception ==
Jarrod Jones of The A.V. Club said the episode ""does not explore the full spectrum of Legends' trajectory – moments from the middle seasons are left relatively dry – buts it's still a touching tribute to how Gideon and the crew have affected one another"", and gave it a B+ rating. Writing for Game Rant, Bruno Savill De Jong rated the episode four stars out of five, saying it is a ""surprisingly focused episode, considering the extent of cameos and memories it must cover. Although it doesn't quite have room for the whole ensemble to shine, it does delve into the messy heart that has become core to Legends"".

Smolders was a supporter of the intimism style and had a preference for drawing and painting children, ballerinas, young women and terraces. Motherhood and landscapes are also recurring themes. His work has a dreamlike atmosphere but is not anecdotal. He made a lot of sketches and is described as 'an exceptionally clever draftsman'. ""Drawing was essential to him and meant to be the spontaneous processing of his thinking.""
Smolders always remained faithful to his style. He was not an innovator but a passionate observer.
His work has been exhibited in Antwerp, Bruges, Brussels and Knokke, but also in The Hague, Rotterdam and New York.In 1952 Smolders received the price Appel from the Committee for Artistic Operation. The Provincial Center Arenberg in Antwerp organized a tribute exhibition in 1991.

Jacob Furth,"Jacob Furth (November 15, 1840 – June 2, 1914) was an Austrian Empire-born American entrepreneur and prominent Seattle banker. He played a key role in consolidating Seattle's electric power and public transportation infrastructure, and was a member of Ohaveth Sholum Congregation, Seattle's first synagogue. Bill Speidel called him ""the city's leading citizen for thirty years,"" adding that Furth ""may even have been the most important citizen Seattle ever had.""Clarence Bagley wrote shortly after Furth's death:

... while Jacob Furth was masterful, commanding and dynamic in his business affairs, he regarded business as but one phase of existence, and he was not less the public-spirited citizen and the philanthropist than he was the successful financier. Indeed, there was no period in all of his career when business so occupied his attention that he would not turn to listen to some plan for the city's betterment or some tale whereby his personal aid was sought for an individual or an organization.


== Early life ==
Furth was born in Schwihau, Bohemia (now Švihov, Czech Republic) November 15, 1840, the son of Lazar and Anna (Popper) Furth, Jewish natives of Bohemia. Of their ten sons and two daughters, eight eventually came to America. He attended school to the age of thirteen years, then began a career as a confectioner in Budapest. He decided at sixteen (so says Bagley; other sources say 18) to try his fortune in America and made his way to San Francisco, arriving in 1856.He had with him letters of introduction to the Schwabacher Brothers, a prominent Jewish pioneer merchant family firm. After his arrival, he used his last ten dollars to get to Nevada City, California, where the Schwabachers had secured him a position. He clerked mornings and evenings in a clothing store, while attending public schools for about six months to improve his English. When the Schwabachers checked on him after six months, his English was already better than theirs.He was rapidly promoted, and at the end of three years he was receiving a salary of $US300 per month. He lived frugally, and invested some of his money in a quicksilver mine. By the time the Nevada City store burned in 1862, he had saved enough to open his own clothing and dry-goods store in Shingle Springs, California. Eight years later, in 1870, he moved Colusa, California, where he bought into a general mercantile store. The Schwabachers offered him financing, but he told them he had already saved enough to do this on his own. Shortly after his arrival in Colusa, he became Freemason and eventually became master of his lodge. (He would remain a Mason in Seattle.) In 1878, he was able to buy out the older partners in the store, which he owned and operated until 1882.


== Banking and financial positions ==
In 1882, health problems took Furth to the Puget Sound region in Washington. There, in cooperation with the Schwabachers he helped organize the Puget Sound National Bank with a capital of fifty thousand dollars, and took charge as its cashier. Former Seattle mayor Bailey Gatzert, another Schwabacher associate, was the original bank president. The bank officially opened for business in August 1883. For several months, Furth was the bank's only employee and its only officer in Seattle.Puget Sound National Bank succeeded and prospered; at all times the earnings of the bank were sufficient to increase the capital stock as needed. In 1893 he became bank president, a role he held until his bank's consolidation with the Seattle National Bank in 1910, after which he became chairman of the board of directors of the latter. Bagley writes, ""He became recognized as one of the foremost factors in banking circles in the northwest, thoroughly conversant with every phase of the business and capable of solving many intricate and complex financial problems.""
Besides the Puget Sound National Bank, he organized the First National Bank of Snohomish in 1896 and remained one of its stockholders and directors the rest of his life. He also founded or co-founded several other Washington State banks, including the Kitsap County Bank in Port Orchard, Washington (1908), still active today as the Kitsap Bank. In 1884 he organized the California Land & Stock Company, owning a 14,000-acre (5,700 ha) farm in Lincoln County, Washington, one of the state's largest. Most of the farm was used to raise wheat; it also pastured cattle and horses. This was another company of which Furth would continue as president until his death. He also invested in property, including Seattle real estate and Pacific Northwest timber lands.
Further, Furth became increasingly involved in the building and management of urban and interurban electric railway systems. In 1900, backed by Stone & Webster he became president of the Seattle Electric Company (later Puget Power, merged in 1997 into Puget Sound Energy), which in 1916 operated more than 100 miles (160 km) of track. He aided in organizing and became the president of the Puget Sound Electric Railway in 1902, controlling the line between Seattle and Tacoma, Washington and also owning the street railways in Tacoma and most other Puget Sound cities and towns. He was also president of Seattle's Vulcan Iron Works, which he organized in 1887. One of Seattle's first major industrial operations, it covered an entire Seattle city block at Fifth Avenue and Lane Street in what is now the International District, Seattle's Chinatown.


== Public-minded dealmaker ==
In eulogizing Furth, Judge Thomas Burke said of him,

Jacob Furth was an unusual man. To exceptional ability he united a high order of public spirit and great kindness of heart. It would be difficult to overestimate his work in the upbuilding of Seattle. His time, his strength and his money were always at the call of the city. In his many years of residence I doubt if he were ever once called upon for help or leadership in any public matter in which he failed to respond and respond cheerfully, liberally and with genuine public spirit.
Some seventy years later, Bill Speidel was more succinct: ""All Jacob Furth did was take a squalid little village named Seattle and turn it into a world class city. He made good on Doc Maynard's dream.""Shortly after his arrival in Seattle, Furth (along with Gatzert and Seattle Post-Intelligencer founder John Leary) rescued the Spring Hill Water system from bankruptcy. The privately owned firm supplied the city's water. A new pumping station on Lake Washington in what is now the Mount Baker neighborhood made the system viable, doubling its previous capacity. Although the deal was initially viewed largely as a matter of public service, Furth's financial acumen resulted in a profit. After the Great Seattle Fire of June 6, 1889, which the Spring Hill system failed to put out, Furth broke with most of the city's business interests to back city engineer R. H. Thomson's proposal for a municipally owned gravity-flow system. J.J. McGilvra was the only other member of the Seattle establishment to take this side in the fight.Furth assembled $150 million in bank loans after the Great Seattle Fire, and promised that his bank would make no effort to profit from the fire. In the Panic of 1893, he dissuaded the directors of his Seattle National Bank from calling in all loans. ""What you propose,"" he said, ""may be good banking, but it is not human."" A rapid trip to New York City secured enough capital to buy control of the bank and weather the crisis.


== Financing of shipping and railroads ==
Shortly after the Great Seattle Fire, Furth financed seaman Joshua Green in acquiring his first vessel, the Fannie Lake (or Fanny Lake); Green would eventually consolidate the Puget Sound Mosquito Fleet and center it at Seattle, a major factor in Seattle's rise to regional preeminence, and later became a banker himself.  Furth arranged financing for Green's first shipping firm, the La Conner Trading and Transportation Company, as well as another successful steamboat line, the Anderson Steamboat Company.
Furth worked with both the E.H. Harriman and James J. Hill interests to bring their respective railroads to Seattle, finally bringing Seattle the transcontinental rail connection it had sought for decades.


== Stone & Webster ==
Furth's work with Stone & Webster—to consolidate the city's public transportation system and to consolidate and develop electrical power sources to power them—was more controversial. In the 1890s, Seattle had fourteen independent streetcar and cable car lines; all but J.J. McGilvra's line on Madison Street eventually failed financially, most of them in the wake of the Panic of 1893. Most of them survived only by funding operations out of what should have been maintenance capital. Working with Stone & Webster, Furth stitched together a single system, the Seattle Electric Company and—under pressure from the Seattle City Council, in order to gain the franchise—established a flat fare, initially 5 cents including transfers (previously, a single trip could have cost as much as 40 cents). In 1902, this was expanded with Interurbans to Tacoma and Renton.However, in contrast to the post-Fire investment that had so clearly been for the common good of the city, Seattle Electric was a for-profit, private undertaking, owned largely by East Coast interests. This put Furth in direct conflict with the advocates of local public ownership. Furthermore, the consolidation of the streetcar lines did not solve the maintenance issues, with ""overcrowding, erratic service, accidents, [and] open cars even in winter"" remaining common.The City of Seattle had been involved in municipal power generation since the 1890 creation of the Department of Lighting and Water Works. The 1902 election saw strong populist support for public power, leading to the establishment of Seattle City Light and the city's involvement in hydroelectricity. For the next half-century, Seattle would be variously served by municipal electricity and by Seattle Electric and its successors, until the city bought out its private competitor in 1951.


== Lou Graham connection ==
According to Bill Speidel, brothel-owner Lou Graham was effectively Furth's silent partner from her 1888 arrival in Seattle until her death in 1903. He provided the banking, real estate, and political connections she required to establish the city's leading parlor house; when people came to him seeking a loan, and he thought their idea was good but that he'd never get it past his board of directors, he referred them to Graham for an informal, high-interest loan. She may have been instrumental in saving Puget Sound National Bank from a bank run during the Panic of 1893, by ostentatiously making a large deposit. When she died, a Puget Sound National Bank employee became administrator of her estate.


== The Schricker scandal ==
Toward the end of his life, Furth's reputation was somewhat tarnished by a scandal related to a bank in La Conner, Washington, although Furth was posthumously acquitted of all culpability.W.E. Schricker's private bank in La Conner failed in 1912 with $378,766.91 in debts and less than $200,000 in assets. Schricker blamed Furth and other officers of Furth's bank; Furth was arrested, lampooned in the press, and convicted by a jury on April 18, 1913, and fined $10,000. Schricker accused Furth of recommending that he continue to take deposits even after he knew his bank was in trouble. The prosecutor amplified this with a charge that Furth had done so to keep Schricker's bank going just long enough to pay notes due to Furth's bank, thereby harming other depositors. However, Furth was unaware that Schricker had made $348,554.83 in self-dealing loans to the Fidalgo Lumber Company of Anacortes, Washington, of which Schricker was a partner. In other words, most of the bank's debts could be accounted for by Schricker's failure to collect from himself.The conviction was completely overturned on appeal, December 18, 1914, but by that time Furth was not alive to see his reputation cleared.


== Civic associations and public office ==
Among other associations, Furth was a member of Seattle's prestigious Rainier Club and the Seattle Chamber of Commerce. He was a two-term president of the Chamber. He served as a Republican on the Seattle City Council from 1885 until 1891. In 1901 he was the key organizer of Seattle's anti-union Citizens' Alliance.
He also played a key role in fundraising for the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition.


== Marriage and family ==
In California, in 1865, Furth married Lucy (or Lucia) A. Dunton, a native of Indiana from what Lee Micklin characterizes as ""an early American family""; they eventually had three daughters: Jane E., Anna F., and Sidonia. In 1884, Lucy Furth, along with Babette Gatzert (wife of Bailey Gatzert, and herself born a member of the Schwabacher family) founded the Ladies Relief Society (now Seattle Children's Home). It was Seattle's first charity.Although he married a Gentile, Furth remained a practicing Jew. He belonged to the ""quasi-reform"" Ohaveth Sholum Congregation, Seattle's first synagogue, and later to the Reform Temple de Hirsch, one of the congregations that merged into the present-day Temple de Hirsch-Sinai.Furth's daughter Jane married E.L. Terry. Anna married Frederick K. Struve, a Seattle financier and son of Seattle mayor Henry G. Struve. His daughter Sidonia married a U.S. Army colonel named Wetherill; the Wetherills inherited the Furth family summer estate at Yarrow Point on the east shore of Lake Washington. The bulk of this estate, 16 acres (6.5 ha) was deeded to the towns of Yarrow Point and Hunts Point as the Wetherill Nature Preserve on July 4, 1988.

AnimeCon,"AnimeCon, held in San Jose, California in 1991, was the fourth anime convention created in the United States, the first convention to have major backing from the anime industry, the first anime-specific convention within the state of California (which spawned many similar conventions thereafter), and the first anime-specific convention in the US to break 1,000 attendees. It also formed the genesis of Anime Expo (currently the largest anime-specific convention in North America).


== Guests ==
Guests included Jerry Beck, Colleen Doran, Geoff Everets, Carl Macek, Ken Macklin, Johji Manabe, Leiji Matsumoto, Luke Menichelli, Haruhiko Mikimoto, Robert Napton, John O'Donnell, Toshio Okada, Katsuhiro Otomo, David Riddick, Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, Toren Smith, Kenichi Sonoda, Rick Sternbach, Jeff Thompson, Adam Warren, Robert Woodhead, Trish Ledoux and Toshifumi Yoshida.


== Attendance ==
Attendance was officially estimated at 2,000.


== Sponsors ==
The convention was co-sponsored by Gainax, Cal-Animage, the founders of BayCon, BAAS, and Studio Proteus.


== History ==
During its inaugural year, AnimeCon went deeply into debt due to severe budget overruns. Soon after, a management dispute erupted which imperiled the chance of a follow-on. Many of the staff went on to form Anime Expo, while others went on to form a rival convention, Anime America (which was canceled in 1997 and went defunct shortly thereafter). The period between late 1992 and early 1997 is sometimes referred to as the ""Con Wars"" by attendees and staffers of both conventions. It was typified by a number of personal attacks and allegations of sabotage on and off the Internet (and in particular on rec.arts.anime).
Although Anime Expo is, for all practical purposes, considered separate from AnimeCon, the Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation (AX's parent organization) took control of AnimeCorp in 1992 and assumed many of its legal and financial obligations (including all debts incurred), the rights to the AnimeCon name, and existing stocks of unsold merchandise (including large numbers of the aforementioned T-shirts). Pre-registrations for the planned AnimeCon '92 were converted into Anime Expo '92 pre-registrations. AnimeCon Corporation was formally dissolved in February 1993.Today, AnimeCon merchandise is considered a collectible item by some. Program booklets and T-shirts can still be found. AnimeCon T-shirts were sold on behalf of the SPJA during the subsequent years of AX.
San Jose would begin hosting another anime convention known as FanimeCon in 1999. Since 2004, FanimeCon has taken place at the San Jose Convention Center.

Turbonilla halistrepta,"Turbonilla halistrepta is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Pyramidellidae, the pyrams and their allies.


== Description ==
The shell has an elongate-conic shape. Its length measures 9.5 mm. Its color is wax yellow with a broad subsutural, narrow submedian and a broad subperipheral band of golden brown. These color markings make this species different from Turbonilla lituyana and Turbonilla oregonensis. (The whorls of the protoconch are decollated). The whorls of the teleoconch are situated rather high between the sutures. They are very slightly shouldered. They are marked by almost obsolete, nearly vertical axial ribs, which are best, but still poorly developed near the summit and practically disappear before they reach the suture on the early whorls. On the last three they are scarcely indicated. Of these ribs there are about 28 upon the third and 24 upon the seventh whorl. The sutures are well impressed. The periphery and the short base of the body whorl are somewhat inflated, and well rounded. The entire surface of the spire and the base are marked by many well incised, closely spaced, wavy, spiral striations. Some of the fine lirations between the incised lines are a little darker colored than the rest of the surface and appear as reddish-brown hair lines. The aperture is oval. The posterior angle is acute. The outer lip is thin, showing the external sculpture within. The columella is slender, strongly curved and moderately revolute.


== Distribution ==
The type species was found in the Pacific Ocean off Newport, California.

Barnaby Skurloke or Skurlog,"Barnaby Skurloke or Skurlock (1520 – c.1587) was a prominent and politically influential lawyer in Ireland in the mid-sixteenth century. He held the office of Attorney General for Ireland, and was the first holder of the office to be so described. He was for a short time the acting Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. In later life, he became a leading opponent of the Crown's policies and was imprisoned as a result.


== Background ==
He was a native of Bective, County Meath. His family name is an early form of Sherlock. The Scurlocks were originally from Wales: a branch of the family came to Ireland with Strongbow in the 1170s. The Irish Skurlocks were associated mainly with Meath, and gave their name to Skurlockstown. An Edmund Scurlage was living in Dublin in 1406. Barnaby's parentage is obscure. Sir Henry Sidney in 1577 referred to his ""father and grandfather"" as having acquired substantial estates, and his father was probably the Barnabas Skurlock who received a grant of lands in Meath in 1529.


== Career ==
Barnaby attended Lincoln's Inn and then returned to practice law in Ireland. In 1554 Mary I appointed him Attorney General for Ireland. He was the first Irish Law Officer to use that title, which replaced the earlier title of King's Attorney. On the accession of Elizabeth I, he was reappointed Attorney General and also acted briefly as Lord  Chief Justice, pending a permanent appointment. He was soon removed from both offices: the cause of his dismissal as Attorney General was later stated to be negligence in performing his professional duties, and what would nowadays be called the ""leaking"" of State secrets. It has been suggested that his dismissal was the cause of his later opposition to the Crown. Whether or not this is true, it is clear that by 1560 the authorities, especially Lord Deputy of Ireland, Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex, already regarded him as a troublemaker. From the 1550s on he was consistent in his opposition to the levying of cess (a tax to fund the military garrisons in the Pale). His enemy Sir Henry Sidney later said that Barnaby had made a fortune as Attorney General.Despite his opposition to cess, Skurlock was surprisingly well-regarded by the authorities: he was on the commission to execute martial law in Meath in 1564, and was party to the renewal of the lease of the King's Inn in 1567. The Lord Chancellor of Ireland, Sir William Gerard, described him as one of the most experienced lawyers in Ireland in 1576, when he was referred to as ""one of the Queen's learned counsel"". He seems to have suffered serious ill-health around this time, being described as ""aged and sickly"" (56 was a considerable age then).


=== The cess controversy ===
Serious political trouble arose in the following year, when there was renewed opposition by the Anglo-Irish gentry to the cess. Skurlock was chosen, with Henry Burnell and Richard Netterville, to travel to London to petition the Queen for its abolition, on account of the ruinous cost it imposed on the gentry of the Pale. The Lord Deputy, Sir Henry Sidney, argued that the petition was a defiance of the Royal Prerogative. The Queen agreed and the three petitioners were imprisoned in the Fleet Prison. They were soon released, after having made an abject apology to the Queen and the Lord Deputy, although they did not drop their opposition to the cess.His last years seem to have been peaceful enough, apart from a dispute with the Lord Justice of Ireland, Sir Henry Wallop in 1584 over the right of Skurlock's sons to take possession of the manors of Skurlockstown and Ifernock. His date of death is not recorded but he was still living in 1586.


== Family ==
He married a daughter of the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, Sir John Plunket, and they had at least two sons: Oliver, who held the manor of Skurlockstown, and Walter, who was Attorney General for Connaught from 1601 to 1613. The Barnaby Scurlock who surrendered his estate in 1622 and had it regranted to him was probably a grandson of the elder Barnaby.


== Character ==
In character, he was described as ""learned, modest and discreet""  although his enemy Lord Deputy Sidney, while admitting his ""credit and influence"", called him a man who had grown ""old and crafty"", and was  given to ""indecent and undutiful speech"".

Sigismund Koelle,"Sigismund Wilhelm Koelle or Kölle (July 14, 1823 – February 18, 1902) was a German missionary working on behalf of the London-based Church Missionary Society, at first in Sierra Leone, where he became a pioneer scholar of the languages of Africa, and later in Constantinople. He published a major study in 1854, Polyglotta Africana, marking the beginning of serious study by Europeans of African languages.


== Life ==
Sigismund Koelle was born in Cleebronn in the Württemberg region of southern Germany. In his Württemberg origin he resembles his contemporaries Johann Ludwig Krapf (born 1810) and Johannes Rebmann (born 1820), who also worked as linguists and missionaries for the Church Missionary Society, but in East Africa. Another CMS missionary born in Württemberg was Karl Gottlieb Pfander (born 1803), who was Koelle's colleague in Istanbul.
After training in the Basel Mission, a missionary seminary in Basel, Switzerland, Koelle transferred in 1845 to the Church Missionary Society based in London; after further training in Islington he was ordained by the Bishop of London, Charles Blomfield. From December 1847 to February 1853 he lived and worked in Sierra Leone, the British protectorate established in West Africa for liberated slaves.
Koelle taught at Fourah Bay College, which was founded by the Church Missionary Society in 1827. ""He was a Semitic scholar, and started a Hebrew class at Fourah Bay; and very soon African youths, the children of liberated slaves, could be seen reading the Old Testament in the original."" While in Sierra Leone he also collected linguistic material from many African languages, some of it from freed slaves such as Ali Eisami, a Kanuri man. Koelle's major work, Polyglotta Africana (1854), is considered the beginning of the serious study of a large range of African languages by European scholars.


== Grammar of the Vai language ==
In 1849, when Koelle had been in Freetown for just over a year, he was asked to investigate a report that speakers of the Vy, Vei, or Vai language were using a script of their own invention. Koelle made a 7-week trip to Vailand to meet the inventor of the script, and wrote an account of his journey which was published later that same year. In mid 1850, Koelle spent a few weeks in the Gallinas district of Vailand, and from November 1850 to March 1851 he worked again in the Cape Mount district. By July 1851 he had completed his Vai grammar, and it was published by the Church Missionary Society in 1854.


== Polyglotta Africana ==

The second great linguistic work carried out by Koelle during his five years in Sierra Leone was the Polyglotta Africana. The idea of this was to use the fact that Sierra Leone was a melting pot of ex-slaves from all over Africa to compile a list of 280 basic words (a sort of early Swadesh list) in some 160 languages and dialects. These were then grouped as far as possible in families. Most of the informants who contributed to this work came from West Africa, but there were also others from as far away as Mozambique. One area that was lacking was the Swahili coast of Kenya and Tanzania, since it seems that slaves from this region were generally taken northwards to Zanzibar and Arabia rather than southward towards America and Brazil. The pronunciations of all the words were carefully noted using an alphabet similar, though not identical, to that devised by Karl Richard Lepsius, which was not yet available at that time. The name of the book was imitated from a well-known work called Asia Polyglotta (1823) by the German scholar Julius Klaproth.In the introduction Koelle tells us that he wanted a selection of words that would be simple enough for each informant to be interviewed on a single day, and for this reason he omitted pronouns, which would have taken much longer to elicit. He adds that a few years earlier during a long vacation he had made a similar such list, of just 71 languages, and that in making the present list he had learnt from that experience. Included with a book is a map of Africa showing the approximate location, as far as it could be ascertained, of each language, prepared by the cartographer August Heinrich Petermann.
The value of the list is not merely linguistic, since the work not only includes the words themselves, arranged with all the languages spread out on two facing pages for each group of three English words, but Koelle also added a short biography of each informant, with geographical information about their place of origin, and an indication of how many other people they knew in Sierra Leone who spoke the same language. This information, combined with a census of Sierra Leone conducted in 1848, has proved invaluable to historians researching the African slave trade in the 19th century. Of the 210 informants, there were 179 ex-slaves (two of them women), while the rest were mostly traders or sailors. An analysis of the data shows that typically Koelle's informants were middle-aged or elderly men who had been living in Freetown for ten years or more. Three-quarters of the ex-slaves had left their homeland more than ten years earlier, and half of them more than 20 years before; and three-quarters of the informants were over 40 years old. Another interesting facet of the book is the manner in which the informants had been made slaves. Some had been captured in war, some kidnapped, some sold by a relative, others condemned for a debt or sentenced for a crime.


== Grammar of the Kanuri language ==
Another work researched and written by Koelle in Sierra Leone was the Grammar of the Bornu or Kanuri Language, also published in 1854. Koelle was engaged on this at intervals from 1848 to 1853, working for several hours a day with an informant called Ali Eisami Gazirma (also known as William Harding). Eisami also provided the material for another work, African Native Literature, which consists of proverbs, fables, descriptive accounts, and historical fragments in the Kanuri language.Of Koelle's grammar, a later researcher, A. Von Duisburg, wrote:
""Koelle's Grammar is compiled with very great industry, but it unfortunately contains numerous errors, which may be explained by the fact that Koelle was never in Bornu or any racially allied country. His chief informant was an interpreter resident in Sierra Leone, who had left his mother-country more than forty years before Koelle made use of him in his linguistic studies. An examination of the above-mentioned Grammar warrants the assumption that Koelle himself never spoke Kanuri. He himself admits in the Preface to his Grammar that his interpreter did not seem to be reliable as regards the pronunciation of consonants, a fact which is frequently noticeable in the Grammar.""However, the translator P. A. Benton adds in a footnote: ""I cannot agree. Koelle seems to me to be extraordinarily accurate.""


== Later career ==
After 1853, Koelle, who had become ill by the end of his stay in Sierra Leone, never returned to West Africa. For a time he continued his linguistic researches, in particular on questions of standard orthography, in connection with the Standard Alphabet which was being discussed in 1854 by Karl Lepsius. In 1855 he was sent to Egypt, but remained only a short time; he moved on to Haifa in Palestine in the same year. In 1856 he was awarded the Volney Prize of 1,200 francs by the French Academy of Sciences for his work on the Polyglotta Africana.In 1859 he was posted by the Church Missionary Society to Constantinople (Istanbul) to join Karl Gottlieb Pfander, who had gone out the year before. Together with another missionary, R. H. Weakley, he had some success in converting Turks to Christianity. However, in 1864, there was a violent reaction from the Turkish government and several Turkish converts were arrested. Pfander and Weakley were forced to leave Constantinople, while Koelle remained behind for a few more years. When the Church Missionary Society withdrew from the city in 1877, he stayed on there for a time as an independent missionary, until in 1879 he too was forced to depart, after being arrested, together with a Turkish friend, Ahmed Tewfik, who had helped him translate the Anglican prayer book into Turkish. Koelle was released after a few hours, but Tewfik was imprisoned and sentenced to death. After pressure from the British Government, Tewfik was sent into exile on the island of Chios, and eventually escaped to England, where he was baptized in 1881 into the Anglican church in a ceremony in St Paul's, Onslow Square London, witnessed among others by Koelle's father-in-law, Archdeacon Philpot. However, it seems that he was unhappy with his new life and after being sent to Egypt in 1883 he eventually voluntarily gave himself up again to his captors in Chios.Sigismund Koelle died in London in 1902.


== Family ==
After returning from Africa, Koelle married Charlotte Elizabeth Philpot (1826–1919), the daughter of an English archdeacon. They had seven children. One of them, Constantine Philpot Koelle, born in Constantinople in 1862, later became a Church of England clergyman. One of Constantine's sons, Sir Harry Philpot Koelle (1901–1980), was to become a vice-admiral in the British Navy. His descendants pronounce the name as ""Kelly"".

Billingsley Report,"The Billingsley Report is a college football rating system developed in the late 1960s to determine a national champion.  Billingsley has actively rated college football teams on a current basis since 1970. Beginning in 1999, Billingsley's ratings were included as one of seven mathematical formulas included in the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) rankings.Unlike the other mathematical formulas included in the BCS rankings, the Billingsley Report was not prepared by a trained mathematician or statistician. Instead, the Billingsley Report is prepared by Richard Billingsley (born c. 1951), a lifelong college football fan in Hugo, Oklahoma. Billingsley attended Texas Bible College, became a minister and later a consultant in the country music business. He began preparing his own weekly college football ratings as a hobby.Billingsley has also applied his ratings methodology retroactively to select national champions for each year from 1869 to 1870 and from 1872 to 1969.  Since 1996, the ""Billingsley Report"" has been one of the selectors of historic national champions recognized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in its Football Bowl Subdivision record book.The NCAA describes Billingsley's methodology as follows: "" The main feature of his system is the inclusion of a unique rule for head-to-head competition, with the overall system consisting of a balanced approach to wins, losses, strength of schedule, and home-field advantage. A slight weight is given to most recent performance. The Billingsley formula does not use margin of victory, however, the Billingsley MOV formula does include margin of victory in the calculations.""Richard Billingsley is also the owner of the College Football Research Center.


== National champions ==
Billingsley Report selections first appeared in the 1995 edition of the NCAA records book, listing champions since 1960. In the 1996 book these champions were joined with retrospective selections all the way back to 1869. This original set of champions was last printed in the 1999 NCAA records book.
In 1998 Billingsley adjusted his formula in order to participate as a computer poll in the Bowl Championship Series rankings. He re-ranked all past seasons with this new formula; these new champions were printed in the 2000–2003 NCAA records books.
Prior to the 2001 season, Billingsley again changed the formula in order to remove ""Margin of Victory"" from the system's BCS calculations. This third set of champions appeared in the 2004–2012 NCAA books.
Finally, beginning in 2013, the NCAA records books profess to list both Billingsley's ""No Margin of Victory"" and ""Margin of Victory"" champions is cases where they differ. However, this list is not a simple superset of the previous two sets of champions.
The table below lists the 4 distinct sets of Billingsley Report national champions printed in NCAA records books since 1995. The selections are additionally sourced to the College Football Research Center website, where Billingsley made the same updates to his national champions after each change to the Billingsley Report formula.

National School of Drama,"National School of Drama (NSD) is a theatre training institute situated at New Delhi, India. It is an autonomous organization under Ministry of Culture, Government of India. It was set up in 1959 by the Sangeet Natak Akademi and became an independent school in 1975. In 2005, it was granted deemed university status, but in 2011 it was revoked. Paresh Rawal is the current Chairperson & Chittaranjan Tripathy currently serves as Director of National School of Drama (NSD).


== History ==
The origins of the school can be traced back to a seminar in 1954, where the idea of a Central institution for theatre was mooted, subsequently, a draft scheme was prepared in 1955, and the Sangeet Natak Akademi, which had Jawaharlal Nehru as its president, started drawing plans for the institution. Meanwhile, elsewhere in Delhi, Bharatiya Natya Sangh (BNS) with assistance from UNESCO, independently established the 'Asian Theatre Institute' (ATI) on 20 January 1958, and in July 1958, ATI was taken over by the Sangeet Natak Akademi (SNA), India's National Academy of Music, dance and drama of Government of India.In the following year, the government merged it with the newly founded school, and thus NSD was established in April 1959 under the auspices of Sangeet Natak Akademi. Initially, the school was situated at Nizamuddin West and was called 'National School of Drama and Asian Theatre Institute, whose first batch passed out in 1961. During his tenure as the director of the institution, Ebrahim Alkazi (1962–1977), not just overhauled the syllabus, but also had the students dig and build platforms for a theatre in the backyard of a rented Kailash Colony house, where NSD had moved. Later when it moved to its present location, he also designed two theatres for NSD, including a 200-seat studio theatre, and the open-air Meghdoot theatre, under a banyan tree.In 1975 it became an autonomous organization, under the erstwhile Ministry of Education and Ministry of Culture, Department of Culture, with the name 'National School of Drama' and relocated in May 1975, to its present premises at Bahawalpur House, the residence of Bahawalpur a former princely state. However, the place is generally known by adjacent (now demolished) Mandi House, the former residence of Raja of erstwhile Mandi princely state. In 1999, the school organized its first National Theatre Festival, 'Bharat Rang Mahotsav', generally held during the second week of January each year.
In 2008, the institution celebrated its golden jubilee at its annual theatre festival, Bharat Rang Mahotsav, with a gathering of its alumni from all over the country, the festival's satellite edition in Mumbai showcased plays of NSD graduates, including Ratan Thiyam's Prologue, Bansi Kaul (Aranyadhipati Tantiya), Neelam Mansingh Chowdhury (The Suit), Sanjay Upadhyay (Harsingar), Baharul Islam (Akash), Mohan Maharishi (Dear Bapu) and M K Raina (Stay Yet Awhile). Waman Kendre was appointed as Director the school in 2013. He will serve a five-year term. He has done post-graduate with research in folk theatre of Kerala from NSD. He belongs to the nomadic Vanjara tribal community of Marathwada and was one of the leading lights of the Dalit theatre movement in Maharashtra in the late 1970s. As of 10 September 2020 Paresh Rawal, has been appointed as the Chairman of the National School of Drama. On 6th October 2023, Chittaranjan Tripathy became the new Director of NSD. He is a prominent theater and film actor, director, screen writer and music composer both in Hindi and Odia film industry.


=== Deemed university status ===
On 16 March 2005, the Government of India granted the NSD the status of deemed university. However, in 2010 the NSD Society asked for the deemed university status to be revoked since ""[it] could undermine the professional training, autonomy, and flexibility required in the creative fields such as theatre."" Thus, in October 2011, the status was revoked on request of NSD.


== Performing Wings ==


=== Repertory Company ===
The professional performing wing of NSD, the 'National School of Drama' Repertory Company was set up in 1964, with an aim to promote professional theatre in India. Its first head was Om Shivpuri, followed by Manohar Singh, Ram Gopal Bajaj (Acting Chief), J.N. Kaushal (Acting Chief), Anuradha Kapur (Acting Chief), and Suresh Sharma, Sagar Kamble, Atul Singhai (Animation chief).
Today, the Repertory Company has staged over 120 plays based on the works of about 70 playwrights and featuring around 50 directors in several countries, and various cities across the nation, and has its own festival every year called 'Annual Repertory Company Summer Festival', in which it performs new and past plays. In 2004, the repertory celebrated its 40th anniversary with a theatre festival in New Delhi.


=== Sanskaar Rang Toli ===
In 1989 NSD established the 'Theatre-in-Education Company' (T.I.E), called 'Sanskaar Rang Toli', which coaches children aged 8 to 16 years. The company regularly performs plays for school and adult audiences alike, and has its own yearly theatre festivals, 'Jashn-e-Bachpan' and Bal Sangam.


== Performing spaces ==
The school has three auditoria within the campus:

Abhimanch Auditorium
Sammukh Auditorium
Bahumukh AuditoriumApart from that, it has a studio theatre and minor performances spaces used on special occasions, like the Bharat Rangmahotsav.


== Regional centres ==
In a bid to decentralize its activities, NSD opened Regional Resource Centres (RRC) across India, the first of which was opened at Bengaluru in 1994. A new centre was established in Varanasi.


== Bharat Rang Mahotsav ==

Bharat Rang Mahotsav, or the 'National Theatre Festival', established in 1999, is the annual theatre festival of National School of Drama (NSD), held in New Delhi, today it is acknowledged as the largest theatre festival of Asia, dedicated solely to theatre. The School also organizes a festival showcasing tribal traditions, the Adirang Mahotsav.


== Extension Program ==
Extension Programmes, through which NSD staff and alumni conduct workshops in various parts of the nation, were established in 1978 and have since conducted workshops and programmes for adults and children throughout the country, including some in Nepal, Sikkim, Ladakh, and Bhutan. Since its inception in 1980, the Traditional Theatrical Project has regularly allowed creative contact between traditional and contemporary theatre performers. Along with providing an introduction to theatre, these programmes aim to help participants develop their personalities and broaden their emotional horizons.

==== Northeast Extension Programme ====
The National School of Drama's Extension Programme connects the school in Delhi to other regional theatres around the country. The school has been imparting training and creating plays with theatre practitioners all throughout the country through a series of well-planned theatrical workshops that take into account the individual demands of each location. These courses instruct those who cannot afford to spend three years at NSD and those who have been practising theatre for a long time.
The school also builds contact with a significant number of theatrical groups and organizations that are performing good work in the regions through collaborative projects through this programme.
NSD has recently arranged a series of theatre workshops in the Northeastern States as part of its Extension Programme. The workshops followed a three-step programme: the first was to pique all participants' interest in the complexities of the theatre experience - performance and transference; the second was to impart training in the area; and the third was to assist and guide them in preparing productions based on the received training. Once the productions were completed, participants were given the opportunity to present ten shows in various sections of the region in order to build self-confidence, a variety of experience, and audience engagement. Finally, the School decided to provide a forum to present these creations, which is how the Poorvottar Natya Samaroh was born.The first Poorvottar Natya Samaroh took place in Guwahati in 2007, followed by the second in Gangtok, Sikkim, in 2008. The plays in the Poorvottar Natya Samaroh covered a wide range of topics, including romance, social issues such as caste and gender, exploitation in a feudal system, survival and hope in a conflict-torn societal milieu, philosophical ideas, and resistance.This combination of theatre experiences will not only allow for the mixing of all those engaged, but the spectrum of representation and performance will also highlight varied styles of portrayal, each as valid as the other. The festival seeks to provide a space of meaningful interaction and involvement for all by emphasizing this oneness in the variety of human life and existence.

Rachel Dennison,"Rachel Ann Parton George (formerly Dennison, née Parton; born August 31, 1959) is an American retired singer and actress and the youngest sister of entertainer Dolly Parton.


== Career ==
Parton was raised in the Church of God. She is the youngest of twelve children born to Avie Lee Caroline (née Owens; 1923–2003) and Robert Lee Parton Sr. (1921–2000). As well as Dolly Parton, her other celebrity siblings include older brother, entertainer Randy and sister Stella Parton.As a child, she enjoyed wearing make-up and imitating her favorite stars. She later recalled, ""I was the only girl in the first grade that routinely powdered and rouged my face."" Dennison also remembered, ""I never really wanted to be in show business. I just wanted to raise my kids and keep house, but I guess being in the business is just a 'family tradition'."" She quit school after the eighth grade and toured the country with her family, often doing her elder sisters' make-up and occasionally singing backup. At age fifteen, she performed solo on stage for the first time. During her first performance, as she remembers, ""right off I saw this new piano man (pianist Richard Dennison) and knew he was the fella for me."" She and Dennison were married three years later.In 1982, Dennison landed her first and only acting role in the ABC television sitcom incarnation of 9 to 5. Before the show premiered, she stated in a People magazine interview: ""I'm sure people will compare me to Dolly—it's only human nature."" Her role, as bombshell secretary Doralee Rhodes, had been originated by her older sister, Dolly Parton, in the hit 1980 theatrical film of the same name. 9 to 5 was shot before a live studio audience and co-starred Rita Moreno and Valerie Curtin. The series had an impressive beginning in the ratings, but after a retooling (including the addition of Leah Ayres to the cast), the series was canceled by ABC after 33 episodes in 1983. The sitcom proved popular in reruns, leading producers to revive it in first-run syndication in 1986. Sally Struthers joined the cast, and the sitcom's popularity revived, producing another 52 episodes before ending in 1988.
During the network run of the series, she and her fellow cast members appeared on an episode of Battle of the Network Stars in 1983. She performed alongside her sister in a 1987 episode of her sister's variety series Dolly. Dennison's last appearance on camera was during an episode of Bravo Profiles titled ""Dolly Parton: Diamond in a Rhinestone World"" in 1999. Dennison has since retired from acting. Occasionally, she will sing with her siblings.

Lion of Judah,"The Lion of Judah (Hebrew: אריה יהודה, Aryeh Yehudah) is a Jewish national and cultural symbol, traditionally regarded as the symbol of the tribe of Judah. The association between the Judahites and the lion can first be found in the blessing given by Jacob to his fourth son, Judah, in the Book of Genesis of the Hebrew Bible.It is also mentioned in the Book of Revelation of the New Testament as a term representing Jesus of Nazareth, according to Christian theology. The Lion of Judah was also one of the titles used by Ethiopian emperors from the Solomonic dynasty.


== History ==


=== Judaism ===
The biblical Judah (in Hebrew: Yehuda) is the eponymous ancestor of the Tribe of Judah, which is traditionally symbolized by a lion. In Genesis, the patriarch Jacob (""Israel"")  gave that symbol to this tribe when he refers to his son Judah as a Gur Aryeh' גּוּר אַרְיֵה יְהוּדָה, ""Young Lion"" (Genesis 49:9) when blessing him. In Jewish naming tradition the Hebrew name and the substitute name are often combined as a pair, as in this case. The Lion of Judah was used as a Jewish symbol for many years, and as Jerusalem was the capital of the Kingdom of Judah, in 1950 it was included in the Emblem of Jerusalem.


=== Christianity ===
The phrase appears in the New Testament in Revelation 5:5:

Then one of the elders said to me, ""Do not weep. See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals.""
This is widely regarded as a reference to the Second Coming among Christians.Many Christian organizations and ministries use the lion of Judah as their emblem or even as their names.


==== Ethiopia ====
It was depicted on a map of the Upper Nile published in 1683 by the Italian Jobi Ludolfi describing the Lion of Judah symbol as the royal insignia of the Ethiopian Empire. The Solomonic dynasty of Ethiopia claims to have its patrilineal origin in the Israelite Royal House of Judah. The Lion of Judah served as the hereditary title of the Solomonic Ethiopian emperors and nobles including Sabagadis Woldu, Kenfu Hailu, Wube Haile Mariam, Tewodros II, Yohannes IV, Menelik and Haile Selassie and was depicted on the flag of Ethiopia from 1897 to 1974. Due to its association with Haile Selassie, it continues to be an important symbol among members of the Rastafari movement.The Lion of Judah motif figured prominently on the old imperial flag, currency, stamps, etc. and may still be seen gracing the terrace of the capital as a national symbol. After the collapse of the Derg in 1990, a minor political party bearing the name Mo'a Anbessa' made its appearance.


===== Kebra Nagast =====
Ethiopia's history as recorded and elaborated in a 13th-century treatise, the Kebra Nagast, asserts descent from a retinue of Israelites who returned with Makeda, the Queen of Sheba from her visit to King Solomon in Jerusalem, by whom she had conceived the Solomonic dynasty's founder Menelik I. As Solomon was of the tribe of Judah, his son Menelik I would continue the line, which according to Ethiopian history was passed directly down from king to king until Emperor Haile Selassie I (ostensibly the 225th king from King David) was deposed in 1974.Both Christian and Jewish Ethiopian history have it that there were also immigrants of the Tribes of Dan and Judah that accompanied Makeda back from her visit to Solomon; hence the Ge'ez motto Mo`a 'Anbessa Ze'imnegede Yihuda (""The Lion of Judah has conquered""), included among the titles of the Emperor throughout the Solomonic Dynasty.


=== Rastafari ===
The Lion of Judah is a prominent symbol in the Rastafari movement. It represents Emperor Haile Selassie I as well as being a symbol of strength, kingship, pride and African sovereignty.
Rastafari consider the mention of ""The Lion of Judah"" in Genesis 49:9 and Revelation 5:5 of the Bible to refer to Emperor Haile Selassie I. Rastafari hail Haile Selassie I with the titles ""King of kings, lord of lords, conquering Lion of Judah, elect of God, the light of the world"".


== In literature ==
Inspired by the Lion of Judah, C. S. Lewis used a lion named Aslan to represent Jesus in The Chronicles of Narnia.

Consistency (database systems),"In database systems, consistency (or correctness) refers to the requirement that any given database transaction must change affected data only in allowed ways. Any data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules, including constraints, cascades, triggers, and any combination thereof.  This does not guarantee correctness of the transaction in all ways the application programmer might have wanted (that is the responsibility of application-level code) but merely that any programming errors cannot result in the violation of any defined database constraints.Consistency can also be understood as after a successful write, update or delete of a Record, any read request immediately receives the latest value of the Record.


== As an ACID guarantee ==
Consistency is one of the four guarantees that define ACID transactions; however, significant ambiguity exists about the nature of this guarantee. It is defined variously as:

The guarantee that database constraints are not violated, particularly once a transaction commits.
The guarantee that any transactions started in the future necessarily see the effects of other transactions committed in the past.As these various definitions are not mutually exclusive, it is possible to design a system that guarantees ""consistency"" in every sense of the word, as most relational database management systems in common use today arguably do.


== As a CAP trade-off ==
The CAP theorem is based on three trade-offs, one of which is ""atomic consistency"" (shortened to ""consistency"" for the acronym), about which the authors note, ""Discussing atomic consistency is somewhat different than talking about an ACID database, as database consistency refers to transactions, while atomic consistency refers only to a property of a single request/response operation sequence. And it has a different meaning than the Atomic in ACID, as it subsumes the database notions of both Atomic and Consistent."" In the CAP theorem, you can only have two of the following three properties: consistency, availability, or partition tolerance. Therefore, consistency may have to be traded off in some database systems.

Tower Butte,"Tower Butte is a 5,287-foot (1,611 meter) elevation sandstone summit located south of Lake Powell, in northern Arizona. Tower Butte is a butte composed of Romana and Entrada Sandstones with a Morrison Formation caprock. It is situated 9 miles (14 km) northeast of the town of Page, and 7.5 miles (12.1 km) north of LeChee Rock, on Navajo Nation land, towering over 1,000 feet above the surrounding terrain as an iconic landmark of the area. Precipitation runoff from this feature drains into Lake Powell, which is part of the Colorado River drainage basin. The first ascent of Tower Butte was made October 23, 1994, by Jason Keith and David Insley. However, they were not the first to visit the summit as they reported finding litter from prior helicopter landings. An outfit operating out of Page flies helicopter sightseeing flights which land on the flat top of the butte where tourists have panoramic views of the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, Lake Powell, and Navajo Mountain. 


== Climate ==
According to the Köppen climate classification system, Tower Butte is located in an arid climate zone with hot, very dry summers, and chilly winters with very little snow. It is located in the southern edge of the Great Basin Desert on the Colorado Plateau. Spring and fall are the most favorable seasons to visit.

DCPS (gene),"Scavenger mRNA-decapping enzyme DcpS is a protein that in humans is encoded by the DCPS gene.The scavenger mRNA decapping enzymes include Dcp2 and DcpS. DcpS is a scavenger pyrophosphatase that hydrolyses the residual cap structure following 3' to 5' mRNA degradation. DcpS uses cap dinucleotides or capped oligonucleotides as substrates to release m(7)GMP (N7-methyl GMP), while Dcp2 uses capped mRNA as a substrate in order to hydrolyse the cap to release m(7)GDP (N7-methyl GDP). The association of DcpS with 3' to 5' exonuclease exosome components suggests that these two activities are linked and there is a coupled exonucleolytic decay-dependent decapping pathway. The family contains a histidine triad (HIT) sequence in its C-terminal domain, with three histidines separated by hydrophobic residues. The central histidine within the DcpS HIT motif is critical for decapping activity and defines the HIT motif as a new mRNA decapping domain, making DcpS the first member of the HIT family of proteins with a defined biological function.

Martin Ruzé de Beaulieu,"Martin Ruzé, Lord of Beaulieu of Longjumeau and Chilly (c. 1526, in Tours – 6 November 1613, in Paris) was a French politician of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century, who was Secretary of State of the Maison du Roi (or King's Secretary) under Henry III of France, Henry IV of France and Louis XIII.


== Biography ==
Martin Ruzé was the son of William Ruzé, adviser to the Parliament, and Catherine Briconnet. William was the son of another William Ruzé, Lord of Beaulieu, Receiver General of Touraine, Mayor of Tours in 1534, and had a brother, also named William Ruzé (born about 1520; died 28 September 1587), who was confessor and adviser of kings Henry II, Charles IX and Henri III, and who was appointed bishop of Saint-Malo 1570, then bishop of Angers on 29 August 1572.
Martin began his career in the entourage of the king in 1551, starting with Henry II. From 1571 to 1588 he was general superintendent of ammunition and food. In 1573-1574 he was secretary to the King of Poland and in that capacity, he countersigned and raised the royal seal on the letters of King. In August 1574 he was appointed fifth secretary of state.
On 25 September 1576 Martin Ruze became King Henry's Secretary of Finance, and adviser to the King and to the Queen Mother (Catherine de Medici). In 1578, after the resignation of Louis Valley, he was provided with the load controller of the Chancellery. On 10 April 1589 he became Grand Treasurer of the Order of the Holy Spirit to replace the former Secretary of State Nicolas de Neufville, seigneur de Villeroy (who had resigned in disgrace), and retained that office until his death. On 15 April 1589, Ruze installed, for King Henry III, Philippe de Mornay in the office of Governor of Saumur. The ceremony took place in front of the arbor: Florent Lessart, the former governor, faithful to Henry III brought the keys of the city, but out of spite and shame, he dropped to the ground. It is the king's secretary, who then picked up and presented them to the new governor.
In 1596, Ruze bought land at Longjumeau, Chilly-Michel Gaillard. Having no children, he bequeathed his property to Antoine Coëffier de Ruzé, Marquis Effiat, his nephew, who later became Superintendent of Finance (1626) and Marshal of France (1631). In 1601, during the reign of Henry IV, Ruze was appointed Grand Master of Mining and Pierre de Beringhen comptroller-general. Sully ordered them to form a committee to study and conduct excavations in the kingdom of France. On 3 March 1606 Henri IV enlisted Antoine Lomenie, to relieve the elderly Ruze in his tasks as adviser to the King, as Cabinet Secretary, and the royal chief clerk. Ruze established a will on 26 August 1609 he to his heir nephew Antoine Coëffier de Ruzé d'Effiat, on condition of taking the name and arms of Ruze. 
Ruze died on 6 November 1613. His black marble tomb, topped by a statue of Ruze kneeling, can be seen in the church of Saint-Etienne de Chilly-Mazarin.

Congresbury,"Congresbury is a village and civil parish on the northwestern slopes of the Mendip Hills in North Somerset, England, which in 2011 had a population of 3,497. It lies on the A370 between Junction 21 of the M5 and Bristol Airport, 13 miles (21 km) south of Bristol city centre, and 7 miles (11 km) east of Weston-super-Mare. The Congresbury Yeo river flows through the village. The parish includes the hamlet of Brinsea.
The nearest railway station is Yatton, with trains provided by Great Western Railway, but Congresbury once had its own railway station on the Cheddar Valley Line from Yatton to Wells. It was also the starting point for the Wrington Vale Light Railway, which went to nearby Wrington and Blagdon.


== History ==
Congresbury is named after St Congar, who is said to have performed three miracles in the area. The second part of the name is thought to come from burh meaning fortified place.The remains of an Iron Age hill fort at Cadbury Hill have been discovered,
as well as a Roman villa, temple and hoard of coins. Christian burial grounds have also been discovered on Cadbury Hill.The archaeologist Mick Aston identified an Anglo-Saxon sculpture of St Congar which is believed to have come from St Andrew's Church, and which is now in the Museum of Somerset in Taunton.
The parish was part of the Winterstoke Hundred.The village cross dates from the 15th century and is a Grade II* listed building and Scheduled monument. A 2.5 metres (8 ft 2 in) high 15th century cross on an octagonal plinth. The head of the cross was replaced in the early 19th century.Urchinwood Manor is a Grade II* listed building, part of which was built around 1620 with additions being made in the 17th century. The house and surrounding estate has been bought and sold many times over the centuries with the estate now being used as an equestrian centre.The Vicarage includes an early 19th-century vicarage and former Priest's House from around 1446. It has been designated as a Grade I listed building.The village had a school founded in the 1870s that was split into separate infant and junior schools in the early 1970s. In September 2009, the two schools were re-joined as one primary school.


== Governance ==
The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council.
The parish falls within the unitary authority of North Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and South Western Ambulance Service.

North Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in the town hall in Weston-super-Mare. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Woodspring district of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Axbridge Rural District.An electoral ward exists in Congresbury. The area and population are the same as shown above.
The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of the Weston-super-Mare county constituency. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. It was also part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.

Mossehaus,"Mossehaus is an office building on 18–25 Schützenstraße in Berlin, renovated and with a corner designed by Erich Mendelsohn between 1921 and 1923.
The original Mosse building housed the printing press and offices of the newspapers owned by Rudolf Mosse, mainly liberal newspapers such as the Berliner Tageblatt. The sandstone-fronted historicist 1901 building by Cremer & Wolffenstein was badly damaged in 1919 during the Spartacist uprising; held by the insurrectionists, it was laid under siege by government troops.
In 1921, on the strength of his Einstein Tower, Mendelsohn was hired to add extra storeys and a new entrance to the building. The new frontage made prominent use of aluminum and modern typography, and the new upper floors were made from ferro-concrete. The experimental nature of the structure led to a disaster during construction in 1923, when one of the slabs of the new extension fell into the newspaper offices, which were still in use, killing 14 people. 

The use of strips and sculpted elements in the fenestration gave it a dynamic, futuristic form, emphasised by the contrast with the earlier Wilhelmine style. It was one of the first examples of a streamlined building, and hence a great influence on Streamline Moderne. The effect on American architecture is perhaps unsurprising, as Mendelsohn's partner on the Mossehaus and the designer of the interiors was Richard Neutra.
The building was very badly damaged during World War II. The entire wing along Jerusalemerstraße was destroyed, as was the façade on the corner of Schützen-/Jerusalemerstraße, which was elaborately constructed by Mendelsohn. After the war, it was rebuilt in a simplified form.
The building was very close to the Berlin Wall, so it became dilapidated. Though Mossehaus was at one time the tallest non-church building in Berlin, it is now dwarfed by the nearby Fischerinsel tower blocks on the former East side and the Axel Springer AG buildings on the former West side. The building was restored to its original splendor in the 1990s.

Democratic League of Kosovo,"The Democratic League of Kosovo (Albanian: Lidhja Demokratike e Kosovës, LDK) is the oldest and one of the largest political parties in Kosovo.
At the legislative elections held on 24 October 2004 the party won 45.4% of the popular vote and 47 out of 120 seats, seven of which have defected to the Nexhat Daci-led Democratic League of Dardania. One of the founding members, Ibrahim Rugova was the president of the party as the president of Kosovo until his death, on 21 January 2006. At the last legislative elections held on 17 November 2007, the party won only 22.6% and 25 seats but went on to form a Coalition government with Hashim Thaçi's Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK). In October 2010, the LDK withdrew from the coalition.


== History ==
During the late 1980s, nationalism was on the rise throughout the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Since 1974 the province of Kosovo, although part of the Socialist Republic of Serbia, was a self-governed entity over which the Serbian parliament had almost no factual control (see Political status of Kosovo). In the late 1980s, civil unrest which had been striking the province for decades, suddenly erupted further in Kosovo as ethnic Albanians demanded more autonomy (in view of becoming the 7th Yugoslav Republic). At the same time, Serbian Communists' leader Slobodan Milošević used the situation in Kosovo as a political means to win popularity among Serbs. In 1989, he abolished the autonomy of Kosovo using amendments to the Serbian Constitution, reverting Kosovo to its pre-1974 status, thus restoring Serbia's control of the province. In response, a group of Albanian intellectuals gathered the same year to form the Democratic League of Kosovo, which opposed these measures, as well as the ratification of Kosovo's parliament in 1990 which returned the level of Kosovo's autonomy to how it had been sixteen years earlier.
Because of its ideology, which was deemed nationalist and separatist, it was banned by the Yugoslavian authorities, together with the self-styled shadow Kosovo Parliament that opposed the ratifications of Kosovo's real assembly in July 1990. As a result, its members proclaimed in protest on the steps of the parliament building the ""Republic of Kosova"", independent from Yugoslavia, which drafted its own constitution. Claiming that conditions for Albanians were not addressed, the LDK successfully called for a boycott of the Kosovar Albanians of the first free elections in 1990. Following the 1991 population census, in which LDK President Rugova also called for boycott, resulting in only 9,091 Albanians recorded which composed around 2.53% of the Kosovar population, the LDK called the Albanian people to leave and boycott all state institutions until the solution of the Albanian national question. The LDK opposed the centralized control imposed by Belgrade, which reintroduced the Serbian language as the language of Kosovo as well as making other implementations; and they were growing deeply concerned about Belgrade's handling of the Albanian populace with regards to the wider group interests.
By the spring of 1991, the LDK had support from the diaspora in Zurich, Stuttgart and Brussels and numbered a massive membership of approximately 700,000 people. In September 1991 the LDK-constituted shadow Albanian parliament of the self-styled Republic of Kosova adopted a resolution supporting full-scale ""Independence and Sovereignty of Kosovo"". The LDK then led the ""Coordinating Committee of Albanian Political Parties in Yugoslavia"" that included most ethnic Albanian political parties in the country. The decision was that only two choices are viable for peace and stability of the region:
1) unification of all Albanian-populated areas in Yugoslavia, or
2) an undivided Albanian state of all Albanians in the Balkans
The LDK was one of the chief organizers of a poorly organized referendum for self-determination in 1992, in which 87% of Kosovo's Albanian population (numbering 80% of the province's population) voted for independence.  The referendum was declared illegal and further drove a rift between Albanians and Serbians in Kosovo. In 1992 the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was formed and Kosovo remained an autonomous province of the Republic of Serbia. The LDK successfully called for Albanians, including those in Central Serbia and in the Preševo Valley, to boycott of general elections.
The LDK expressed bitterness when Kosovo was ignored during the Dayton Accords in 1995. Supporting an Albanian resistance movement the ""National Movement for the Liberation of Kosovo"", it abandoned its support of the subsequently organized Kosovo Liberation Army, which used violent means to achieve its goals. After 1997, the government of Albania changed, with a first democratic cabinet formed.  Most LDK members abandoned the desire to unite Kosovo with Albania at this point. The LDK's desire for a peaceful solution to the Kosovo conflict lost support among the population and was replaced by the militarist KLA when war erupted in late 1998 and 1999 between the KLA and the Yugoslavian and Serbian forces. Severe atrocities against the Albanian population in Kosovo met with harsh criticism from the LDK. With recommendations from the United States, the LDK abandoned pursuits for an independent Kosovo and sought negotiations with Belgrade with a goal of achieving a substantial level of autonomy for Kosovo, with Ibrahim Rugova traveling to Belgrade and meeting President Milošević (now federal leader) on this matter. This act was criticized by the Albanian public and further downgraded the LDK's popularity. After the NATO bombing campaign  in 1999, leading LDK members were present for the signing of the Kumanovo Treaty that adopted United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 and formalized the cessation of hostilities in Kosovo.  However, despite their support of Resolution 1244, which mandates significant autonomy for Kosovo while recognizing the ""sovereignty and territorial integrity"" of Yugoslavia, the LDK continually supported the independence of Kosovo. It is suspected that hundreds of supporters of the Democratic League of Kosovo were kidnapped, tortured and some killed in secret prisons of the Kosovo Liberation Army, mainly between 1998 and 2001, because perceived as rivals of the Democratic Party of Kosovo. 
While still the second largest political party in Kosovo, the LDK's support has steadily declined since Kosovo's first elections (municipal) in 2001. Other political parties, including those linked to the former Kosovo Liberation Army, such as the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) and the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK), have scored much gains at LDK's expense. The party is presided by a president and five vice-presidents.


== Ideology ==
The Party initially started out as an Albanian nationalist right-wing movement which campaigned for Kosovan independence. It was then led by Ibrahim Rugova a moderate leader who separated with the Kosovo Liberation Army faction. After the war the party remained under the conservative leadership of Rugova. The party also adopted several pro-European policies as well as moving farther to the centre of the political spectrum. However, after Rugovas' death the party went through a period of turmoil with several factions vying for control over the party. The more liberal-conservative stance of Fatmir Sejdiu took over, leading to Nexhat Daci and 6 other MAs forming the more conservative Democratic League of Dardania.
After losing seats consistently under Sejdius leadership unrest within the party began to grow and before the Kosovan parliamentary election, 2010 Isa Mustafa emerged as the new leader securing more than two thirds of the votes. Mustafa's leadership has seen the party return to the more hardline conservative stance, and some politicians have even come to describe the League as a social conservative party as well.
Critics have said the party has considerably abandoned their traditional, Kosovo-Albanian nationalist policies and policies of their founder Ibrahim Rugova. Since August 2014, it has been attacked by Vetevendosje on that front.
The Democratic League of Kosovo has been described as centrist, centre-right and right-wing.


== Controversies ==
Former party leader Isa Mustafa had over 70 cases submitted to the prosecutor over alleged abuse of office while serving as Prishtina mayor. These cases were all thrown out from the prosecutors in charge as the former mayor had no ties with the cases submitted. Former Minister of Culture Astrit Haraqia has been accused of abusing office during 2004–2007 as well as being involved in a large scheme to sell Schengen visas with other party official Ukë Rugova. Suspected of corruption is also current MP Naser Osmani for alleged wrongdoings while in the board of Kosovo Privatisation Agency. He ran and gained a seat in the Assembly despite the accusations. Former Obiliq municipality mayor Mehmet Krasniqi is being investigated for abuse of office. Mehmet Krasniqi has since been found not guilty on the charges.Former MP of the Democratic League of Kosovo Uke Rugova, the son of the late President Ibrahim Rugova, was accused for alleged involvement in a visa scam by the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo. Kosovo’s Special Prosecution had filed an indictment against Uke Rugova and a number of other individuals linked with the Democratic League of Kosovo over an alleged scam concerning Italian visas. Police from the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo first arrested him in February 2014 when he was a member of the Assembly of the Republic of Kosovo, according to the charges, Uke Rugova led a criminal group that falsified travel documents for Kosovo nationals.In October 2020, the Hoti Government drafted the Recovery plan which provided assistance to businesses. In the list made by the Minister of Finance, Labor and Transfers of Kosovo Hekuran Murati a total of 50 businesses had benefited 60 million euros from the recovery package drafted by the Hoti Government. The Recovery plan fueled big businesses in Kosovo instead of small ones, ""Viva Fresh"" had been given over 860 thousand euros, ""Elkos"" of Ramiz Kelmendi with over 675 thousand euros, ""Proex"" with over 335 thousand euros, ""Hib Petrol"" with over 307 thousand euros. In the Recovery plan also benefited the security company ""Balkan International SHPK"" which is owned by Besnik Berisha, a former advisor to Isa Mustafa when he was Prime Minister of Kosovo, his company received over 100 thousand euros.

Danish West Indian daler,"The daler (Danish, plural the same or dalere, English: dollar) was the currency of the Danish West Indies between 1849 and 1917, and of the United States Virgin Islands between 1917 and 1934.


== History ==
The daler replaced the rigsdaler in 1849. No subdivisions were issued until 1859, although a variety of coins were countermarked for use on the islands. In 1859, coins denominated in cents were introduced, with 100 cents = 1 daler.
In 1904, two new denominations were introduced, the bit and franc. The four units were related as 5 bit = 1 cent, 100 bit = 20 cents = 1 franc, 100 cents = 5 francs = 1 daler. Coins were issued each denominated in two units, bits and cents, francs and cents, or francs and daler. Gold coins were struck and issued in 4 and 10 daler denominations (121,000 and 2,005 minted respectively) only in 1904. Banknotes were issued denominated in francs. The franc was equal to the French franc, with text on the reverse of the banknotes (see [1]) giving the value in Danish kroner and øre, with 1 franc = 72 øre.
The daler was replaced by the U.S. dollar 17 years after the Danish West Indies became the U.S. Virgin Islands in 1934, with 1 dollar = 1.0363 daler. This was done through identical ordinances passed by the Colonial Councils for the municipality of Saint Thomas & Saint John and the municipality of Saint Croix, with the agreement of the US Treasury after the expiration of the charter of the National Bank of the Danish West Indies. The US dollar became legal tender on 1 July 1934, while the Danish West Indian daler coins remained legal tender until 14 July 1935 (1 year after Governor Paul Martin Pearson had proclaimed that the US government would exchange US currency for the old Danish currency at the legal rate of conversion as required under the ordinances).


== Coins ==
Just before September 28th 1850, U.S. half dollars with the years 1848, 1849 and 1850 and quarter dollars with the year 1849 were stamped with a crowned FRVII for circulation in the Danish West Indies as shown in the Standard World Coin catalog of Krause & Mishler 1801–1900. One of the half dollars and the quarter dollar was sent to
the Colonial Central Office in Copenhagen in 1850 - these coins are now kept in the Royal Coin Cabinet in the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen. Only these denominations with the above-mentioned years are considered genuine for circulation in Danish West Indies - and they were replaced in 1859 with new coins minted in Denmark for the Danish West Indies.
Until 1878 no other denominations was known with such countermarks - but denominations from U.S., Brazilian, British, British West Indies, French, Dutch and Spanish coins were from then on known to have been stamped with vaguely similar countermarks. These coins were mostly fabricated in France to sell to coin collectors and have not been in circulation in the Danish West Indies.
These fabricated denominations listed in another Krause & Mishler catalog as well as in the coin catalog Unusual World Coins (which includes fantasy coins) are 1⁄2 and 1 cent, 1⁄4, 1⁄2 and 1 dollar from the US, 1⁄8 and 1⁄4 dollar from the British West Indies' anchor coinage, British farthings, 1⁄2 and 6 pence, 1 shilling, 1⁄2 and 1 crown, French 5 sous and 1⁄2 franc, Mexican 8 reales, Dutch 25 cent and Spanish 4 maravedíes, 1, 2 and 4 reales.
In 1859, coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 3, 5, 10 and 20 cents. Except for the bronze 1 cent, these coins were silver. In 1904, with the new currency system, gold coins were introduced in denominations of 4 daler (20 francs) and 10 daler (50 francs). These were followed in 1905 by denominations of 1⁄2, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 40 cents. These coins also bore the denominations 2+1⁄2, 5, 10, 25 and 50 bit, 1 and 2 francs. The 1⁄2, 1 and 2 cents were struck in bronze, the 5 cents in nickel and the other denominations in silver.


== Banknotes ==

In 1849, the State Treasury introduced notes in denominations of 2, 3, 5, 10, 50 and 100 dalere. The Bank of St Thomas issued notes denominated in dollars between 1837 and 1889. It is not indicated on the notes which dollar this was.
In 1905, the Dansk-Vestindiske Nationalbank (Danish West Indies National Bank) introduced notes in denominations of 5, 10, 20 and 100 francs, which also bore indications of their value in Danish kroner, 3.6, 7.2, 14.4 and 72 kroner.

Melaleuca genialis,"Melaleuca genialis is a plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae, and is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It is a rare species, known from one nature reserve. It is similar to Melaleuca tinkeri, mainly differing from it in having hairy leaves and petals. (The leaves of M. tinkeri are glabrous.)


== Description ==
Melaleuca genialis is a shrub growing to about 1.2 m (4 ft) tall. Its branchlets are covered with soft, silky hairs when young but become glabrous with age.  The leaves are arranged alternately, 6.7–10 mm (0.3–0.4 in) long, 0.8–1.1 mm (0.03–0.04 in) wide, linear to narrow egg-shaped and tapering to a non-prickly point. They are also covered with soft, silky hairs and have single mid-vein.The flowers are a shade of pink to purple and are arranged in heads on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering. The heads are 11–14 mm (0.4–0.6 in) in diameter and contain 5 to 7 groups of flowers in threes. The petals are 0.8–1.1 mm (0.03–0.04 in) long and fall off as the flower matures. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower, each bundle containing 2 to 5 stamens. The main flowering season is in October and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules 2.5–3.3 mm (0.1–0.1 in) long.


== Taxonomy and naming ==
Melaleuca genialis was first formally described as a new species in 2010 by Brendan Lepschi. The specific epithet (genialis) is from the Latin word meaning ""jovial"" or ""pleasant"", referring to ""the staff at the Western Australian Herbarium in the 1990s"".


== Distribution and habitat ==
Melaleuca genialis has a restricted distribution in a nature reserve near Wagin in the Avon Wheatbelt biogeographic region. It grows in woodland in clay soils.


== Conservation status ==
Melaleuca genialis is listed as ""Priority Two"" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning it may be threatened but is poorly known, only occurring in a few locations.

Final Fantasy Explorers,"Final Fantasy Explorers (ファイナルファンタジー エクスプローラーズ, Fainaru Fantajī Ekusupurōrāzu) is an action role-playing video game for the Nintendo 3DS. It features character job-oriented combat against classic Final Fantasy monsters and summons. It was released in Japan in December 2014, and in North America and Europe in January 2016.


== Gameplay ==
Final Fantasy Explorers is an action role-playing video game featuring single-player and multiplayer modes. The player starts the game on an island featuring various locations, but can access other areas beyond the island on foot. The main goal of the player is to collect crystals scattered across the world. Unlike other narrative-driven entries in the Final Fantasy series, Explorers follows a quest-driven structure similar to Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles and Capcom's Monster Hunter series. Quest difficulty can be manually adjusted. Unlike previous entries in the series, chocobos, a recurring galliforme bird in the series, are not available for riding. Player characters engage in fights with classic Final Fantasy enemies and summons including Ifrit and Bahamut.There are four character slots available; the three ally slots can be filled with other human players or with monsters previously defeated in battle. Characters are assigned character jobs as with early Final Fantasy titles, including the White Mage, Black Mage, Monk, Paladin and Dragoon among others. Aside from these, there are also character jobs exclusive to the title. Players start the game as a Freelancer, able to adapt themselves to various skills before choosing specific jobs. There are over five hundred different pieces of equipment available for creation from material that is either found on the field or won in combat. The characters are given a maximum of eight skills to be used in battle, and can learn skills for certain jobs which can be used with other jobs when mastered. Using abilities costs a certain number of magic points, but costs less if a character uses a skill linked to a specific job. Skills can also be cancelled in battle. For multiplayer matches, a maximum of four players can use both the Nintendo Network and conventional Wi-Fi to enter a playing session.


== Premise ==
Explorers revolves around the titular group of explorers from the rural town of Libertas who hunt the world for crystals, objects which are the source of life and civilization for the world. The most major source of crystals is the new island of Amostra, but they are guarded by fearsome beasts that the explorers must fight.


== Development ==
The original concept for Final Fantasy Explorers was the brainchild of director Atsushi Hashimoto, who had previously worked on the Nintendo DS remake of Final Fantasy Legend II. Hashimito's original concept was for a multiplayer Final Fantasy role-playing game. One of the earliest design choices was the need for players to fight classic summoned monsters, as he felt that their presence would add an air of nostalgic familiarity to the game. The game's job system was developed at a later stage, when Hashimoto felt it would be a good fit with the multiplayer function. The music is composed by Tsuyoshi Sekito. When he began composing music for the title, he only had some pieces of key and concept art to go on, so was worried that he would not create the right kind of music. When he did meet the team, they were pleased with the results. The game's main theme was designed around the idea of the title characters, while also including darker elements such as ""the suffering of the land"". Explorers was first revealed in early June 2014 in Shonen Jump. The official website opened on June 16. Hashimoto's main goal was to create a game that was accessible for newcomers to the genre. Square Enix was making the game with the idea of turning it into a new action role-playing subseries.


== Reception ==

Final Fantasy Explorers received mixed reviews. It received an aggregated score of 69/100 based on 57 reviews on Metacritic.IGN wrote: ""For a few hours at least, Final Fantasy Explorers is a charming little adventure that's fun to play alone with your monster buddies or with real-life friends. But repetitive quests, the lack of a serious challenge until late in the story and a poor travel system eventually broke the charm spell that Explorers had cast upon me"". GameSpot wrote: ""The sheer number of quests and the complexity of customization will keep you busy for hours. If you like that sort of thing, that is. Even though its economy leaves a bit to be desired, it's not clunky enough to dissuade you from working hard to earn items and craft your ultimate armor"".Final Fantasy Explorers sold over 265,000 copies in Japan by the end of 2015.

Sobornaya Square (Rostov-on-Don),"Sobornaya Square or Cathedral Square (Russian: Соборная площадь) — is a city square in Leninsky District of Rostov-on-Don, Russia.


== History ==
At the end of the 18th century, the Soldier settlement (Soldatskya sloboda) of Rostov-on-Don began to get massively populated. It resulted in the emergence of a local city square, where a market was organized. In February 1781, the construction of a wooden church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, near the site of the square was started. The church was consecrated in September of the same year, yet, however, it burnt down when a lightning stroke it ten years later. In 1860, instead of wooden church, a stone one in the name of Nativity of the Blessed Virgin was built, and it still stands. In 1887 there was built a bell tower, the upper part of which was dismantled during World War II so it could not be used as a mark for shelling.Before the cathedral, between Moskovskaya and Stanislavskogo streets, Sobornaya Square was located. In April 1890, there was erected a bronze monument to Alexander II there. In 1920, the monument was put under a plywood box with a red star, and in 1924 it was demolished. In 1999, about the site of the demolished monument to the Emperor, a monument to St. Dimitry of Rostov was opened in the days of celebrations dedicated to the 250th anniversary of Rostov-on-Don. In the same year, the bell tower of the church was finally rebuilt.
On April 14, 2012, on Holy Saturday, for the first time in history of the square a joint charity event of Rostov Cathedral and city dairy company ""Polyarniy Medved"" — timed to the day of Easter, the company produced the Tsar kulich. It had the weight of about half a ton, and a height of almost one meter. At the end of the Easter service it was divided and distributed among parishioners.The tradition of making a grand kulich continued in 2014 and 2016, when the 500 kg pudding, baked in Rostov-on-Don, was delivered, respectively, to Sevastopol and Simferopol.

Archibald Molbone,"Archibald Molbone (1840-1912) (real name was ""Archibald Malbone"") was a soldier from Rhode Island who received the Medal of Honor for heroism during the American Civil War.


== Biography ==
Archibald Molbone was born in Coventry, Rhode Island, on May 3, 1840.  He was the son of John Malbone and Huldah Corey and was living in West Greenwich, Rhode Island, when he enlisted in the Union Army.
He enlisted in Battery C, 1st Rhode Island Light Artillery on August 11, 1862, and was mustered into service the same day.  During his service with Battery C he was promoted to the rank of corporal.He transferred to Battery G, 1st Rhode Island Light Artillery on December 29, 1864, and was promoted to sergeant on the same day.  He fought at the Battle of Petersburg, Virginia on April 2, 1865.  During the battle, he was one of 20 hand-picked artillerymen who accompanied an infantry assault which captured Confederate artillery pieces which were turned on the Confederates.  He received the Medal of Honor on June 20, 1866.  He was mustered out of service on June 24, 1865, with the rank of sergeant.After the war, Malbone had settled in Coventry, Rhode Island, as of 1870, where the census listed is occupation as ""farm laborer"".  By 1885, he had moved to Scituate, Rhode Island, where the state census listed his occupation as ""hustler"".  He was married to Mary Frances Marcure (1846–1909), with whom he had a son and three daughters.
Malbone died on February 28, 1912.   He is buried in the Burton Potter Cemetery on Field Hill Road in the Clayville section of Scituate.


== Name confusion ==
On census records and in the report of the Adjutant General of Rhode Island for 1865, his name is listed as ""Archibald Malbone"".  The name on his grave marker is ""Archibald Malbourne"" rather than ""Archibald Molbone"", which is the name that appears on the roll of Medal of Honor recipients.  The misspelling of his last name is most likely a clerical error.


== Medal of Honor citation ==
Was one of a detachment of 20 picked artillerymen who voluntarily accompanied an infantry assaulting party and who turned upon the enemy the guns captured in the assault.

== Air Defense Command ==
Alexandria (and later England) AFB was base for Air Defense Command interceptor and radar units along the Gulf Coast. In 1959, the 332d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, assigned to the 32d Air Division stationed F-102 Delta Dagger interceptors at the base between 1959 and 1960.
In addition to the fighter-interceptor squadron, England AFB part of the planned deployment by Air Defense Command of forty-four Mobile radar stations across the United States to support the permanent Radar network established during the Cold War for air defense of the United States. This deployment had been projected to be operational by mid-1952. Funding, constant site changes, construction, and equipment delivery delayed deployment.
On 1 November 1954 the 653d Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron began operations at Alexandria AFB with the activation of AN/MPS-14, AN/TPS-1D, and AN/TPS-10D radars. The site was designated as M-125, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. The AN/MPS-14 continued to operate until site closure in 1963. In 1958 the site was operating an AN/FPS-20 search set.
In addition to the main facility, Air Defense Command operated three AN/FPS-18 Gap Filler sites:

Delhi, LA (M-125A): 32°19′40″N 091°33′25″W
Weeks Island, LA (M-125C): 29°48′34″N 091°48′22″W
Lake Charles GFA, LA (M-125D): 30°11′05″N 093°10′30″WEngland AFB was a planned Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Data Center (DC) location, for the also-planned Shreveport Air-Defense Sector. However, in March 1963 Air Defense Command ordered the site to close due to budget reductions and operations ceased on 23 April.
The station was picked up by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) after the ADC shut down operations. The site is still in operations using the FPS-20A, being known as Alexandria, Louisiana. Virtually all other parts of this old Air Force radar station have been removed. A golf course now occupies part of the old M-125 site.


== Closure ==
In October 1990, the 1991 Base Realignment and Closure Commission decided that England Air Force Base would be closed by September 1992. Reduction of equipment and personnel began almost immediately. The 23d Fighter Wing's Fairchild A-10 ""Thunderbolt II"" aircraft were sent to other units, and the base was closed on 15 December 1992. During the period of its military use, Air Force units from England Air Force Base served in combat in World War II, the Vietnam War and Operation Desert Storm.

== Reception ==


=== Box office ===
It was the sixth most popular film at the British box office in 1962. According to Kinematograph Weekly the film was considered a ""money maker"" at the British box office in 1962.


=== Critical reception ===
Leslie Halliwell opined: ""Blunt melodrama with strong kinship to Saturday Night and Sunday Morning [1960], strikingly directed and photographed amid urban grime and suburban conformity.""The Radio Times Guide to Films gave the film 4/5 stars, writing: ""Unlike the majority of other 'grim up North' dramas that found critical favour during the social realist or kitchen sink phase of British film-making, John Schlesinger's debut feature is about making the most of life rather than carping on about the colour of the grass on the other side of the fence. Crisply adapted by Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall, the film is like a scrapbook of typical human experience, with Schlesinger's eye for detail and his persuasive storytelling style creating characters who could have lived next door to you. Alan Bates and June Ritchie are excellent, but Thora Hird is exceptional.""
Michael Brooke wrote in Sight and Sound:John Schlesinger's feature debut came comparatively late in the angry-young-men/kitchen-sink cycle, but it wears its 54 years rather better than many of its contemporaries, not least because some of its social concerns are just as pervasive today — in particular the impossibility of obtaining decent housing even when both halves of a married couple are in steady employment. The couple in question are Vic Brown (Alan Bates) and Ingrid Rothwell (June Ritchie), not an ideal match on any level other than the basest, but forced to marry after she shyly confesses, in what by 1962 standards was extreme sexual explicitness, that ""Something that should have happened hasn't: it's been 15 days."" When they are forced — by penury and Ingrid's unrealistic domestic ambitions — to move into her mother's fussily maintained semi, it's clear from the moment that Thora Hird first wrinkles her nose at her new son-in-law that things aren't going to go well. But if the narrative runs along decidedly familiar lines, former (and then very recent) documentarist Schlesinger gives the film immense lasting value in its pitch-perfect presentation of the fine detail of northern working-class life — the football, the pubs, the brass-band concerts, the 'mucky books', the works dos with their fake bonhomie, and above all the finely calibrated snobbery. Despite having a skilled job himself, Vic is happy to chat to the window cleaner as an equal, but the latter is then dressed down by Mrs Rothwell, who firmly believes that certain people should know their place. Hird is magnificent in a part that could easily have slipped into crude caricature, and Bates is even better. As with his New Wave predecessors Jimmy Porter and Arthur Seaton, Vic's own character flaws could hardly be more obvious, yet his lonely nocturnal sojourn in the railway station is so laceratingly soul-baring that it would melt even the flintiest heart.


== Awards ==
The film won the Golden Bear award at the 12th Berlin International Film Festival in 1962.

Vaccine refrigerator,"Vaccine refrigerators are designed to store vaccines and other medical products at a stable temperature to ensure they do not degrade. In developing countries with a sunny climate, solar-powered vaccine refrigerators are common.


== Requirements for vaccine refrigeration ==
Many vaccines must be stored at low temperatures, some below -15 °C, and others between 2 and 8 °C. as in an Ice Lined Refrigerator (ILR).  If vaccines are not stored correctly they can lose their effectiveness.
According to the Center for Disease Control, failure to adhere to recommended specifications for storage and handling of immunobiologics can reduce or destroy their potency, resulting in inadequate or no immune response in the recipient.  Maintenance of vaccine quality is the shared responsibility of all handlers of vaccines from the time a vaccine is manufactured until administration.
According to the Immunization Action Coalition, all vaccines should be stored in a refrigerator or freezer that is designed specifically for the storage of biologics or, alternatively, in a separate dedicated unit. A dorm-style combination refrigerator-freezer unit with just one exterior door has been shown to be unacceptable no matter where the vaccine was placed inside the unit. Stand-alone refrigerator or freezer units are best for storage needs. With retail pharmacies playing a major role in pneumonia, influenza and shingles immunization programs, the value of critical vaccines being stored in pharmacy refrigerators has increased. In 2022, it is not uncommon for many pharmacies to have over $100,000 of product in a single refrigerator during peak seasons.
It is estimated that $20 million is wasted annually from poor refrigeration, and up to 35% of vaccines are affected by improper storage. Accurate and uniform temperature in a refrigerator plays a key role in ensuring the life of vaccines, reagents and other biologicals. Research has shown that minor variances in temperature such as those in a household refrigerator can compromise the effectiveness of your biologicals, risking up to thousands of dollars in valuable contents.
Vaccines are also compromised through improper use of the door gasket to feed cables from data loggers and thermometers, allowing excess warm air in, and cold air out of the refrigerator or freezer.  Over time this causes the compressor to work a longer duty cycle and eventually leads to failure.  This can be remedied by using probe access ports, found on most clinical refrigerators and freezer.  These are easy to open up and drastically reduce air intake and loss from inside the units.


== Solar powered vaccine refrigerators ==
In developing countries the electricity grid often does not reach rural areas, and is not always reliable. As keeping vaccines at the appropriate temperature is vital, Solar powered refrigerators are a cost-effective alternative that can be highly reliable. A typical system will use a solar photovoltaic panel to generate electricity from sunlight, and a deep cycle battery to store energy for operation overnight, although newer fridges which have revolutionary Sure Chill Technology or Direct Drive technology do not need batteries to maintain temperatures for many days without sunlight.


== WHO approved products ==
The World Health Organization maintains a list of products related to vaccines that it approves for use, including refrigerators.

George Macan,"George Macan (c. 9 September 1853 – 2 November 1943) was an Irish-born lawyer and reporter, and a cricketer who played first-class cricket for Cambridge University between 1872 and 1875. He was born at Castlebellingham, County Louth, Ireland and died at Wimbledon, London.


== Biography ==
Macan was educated at Harrow School and Trinity Hall, Cambridge. As a cricketer, Macan was a right-handed middle- or lower-order batsman and a right-arm slow bowler, though he did not bowl in first-class cricket. He played in a single match for Cambridge University in 1872, and then reappeared fairly regularly in 1873, scoring 57 against an ""England XI"" which was a rather pale shadow of the All-England cricket teams that played as ""England"" in the period before international cricket began; the 57 was his highest first-class score, but he was unsuccessful in other matches and was not picked for the 1873 University Match against Oxford University. In one match, he played for ""the Gentlemen of England"" against the university side. Though he failed to pass 50 again, he was more consistently successful in both 1874 and 1875 and played in the University Match in both seasons. In 1874, he made 6 and 12 as a poor Cambridge batting side was overwhelmed by an innings and 92 runs; in 1875, he made 2 and 1 not out as Cambridge lost by just six runs. He played no further first-class cricket after leaving Cambridge, but is recorded in non-first-class scorecards from Marylebone Cricket Club and other amateur sides up to 1890.Macan graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1875 and then qualified as a lawyer, being called to the bar in 1877. He did not practise as a barrister, but instead acted as a court reporter, working for the Law Times Reports in the Chancery Division.

Bob Brannum,"Robert Warren Brannum (May 28, 1925 – February 5, 2005) was an American basketball player.
A 6'5"" center from Winfield, Kansas, Brannum attended the University of Kentucky and Michigan State before playing professional basketball.
Brannum was named to the 1943 first team ""All American"" in his senior year at Winfield (Kansas) High School, and his twin brother Clarence was named to the second team at the same time.Brannum spent his first three professional seasons with the Sheboygan Red Skins, whose pro roots dated from 1938, the second season of the National Basketball League. Brannum started all three seasons, during which Sheboygan played in three leagues: the NBL (1948–49), NBA (1949–50) and National Professional Basketball League (1950–51). He was one of the all-time great Redskins players, known for his hard-nosed play, rebounding prowess and scoring ability. In Brannum's final season with Sheboygan, when the Redskins finished with the NPBL's best record, he was selected first-team center after having the league's high scoring average (19.0 points per game). Brannum's 45-point barrage against the Kansas City Hi-Spots on December 28, 1950, was a franchise record, topping the 44 points Bobby Cook scored against the NBA's Denver Nuggets the previous January.
He spent the next four seasons with the Boston Celtics, with whom he earned a reputation as a hard-nosed, pugnacious player. Brannum often served as an unofficial ""bodyguard"" for smaller players on the team, especially point guard Bob Cousy. Cousy later remarked in an interview, ""It was a great luxury to have Bob on the team, and to have him playing the role of protector.  It definitely made my job a lot easier.""Brannum retired as a player in 1955. He later coached basketball at Norwich University, Kenyon College and Brandeis University, where he won a school-record 204 games. Brannum also was the long-time golf coach at Brandeis University. He died of pancreatic cancer in 2005.Brannum was inducted posthumously into the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame in 2013.

Redbud Woods controversy,"The Redbud Woods controversy was a dispute between protesters and the administration of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York over the demolition of a patch of woodlands known as the ""Redbud Woods.""  The area received this name because of the many Redbud trees that grew there and whose blossoms gave the woods a pink tint in the springtime. The website of Cornell University Plantations contained, on September 3, 2005, a description of the woods, and used the name Redbud Woods, so it had some official status at Cornell under this name.


== History ==
Early in Cornell's history, at the turn of the 20th century, banker and hardware magnate Robert H. Treman, Class of 1878, built his family estate on University Hill, just west of today's West Campus. Treman hired his friend Warren Manning, a pioneer of American landscape architecture, to design the site. The Ithaca Daily News of November 2, 1901 reported that the west lawn would be ""left to nature as the best gardener."" Upon his death in 1937, Treman, who preserved all of the Ithaca area's gorges, donated $5000 to the University specifically for the beautification of the campus. Much of his west lawn grew into the Redbud Woods, which retains many original Manning design elements and boasts locally rare yellow oak and hackberry trees as well as an unusually dense stand of redbuds.
Redbud Woods was part of the landscaping of Robert H. Treman's historic estate.  In the late 19th century Warren Manning designed the landscape of the Treman family estate (now Von Cramm Hall, 660, and the Kahin Center) so that it would grow into natural woodlands and beautify the campus.  The woods, if left to grow untouched, might eventually reach the stage of a climax forest.  Over time, Redbud Woods became perceived as a buffer between the University and the surrounding community.
In 1970, the University proposed to construct a parking lot behind Von Cramm Hall.  However, this proposal was dropped after by protests led by Gordon G. Chang.


== 2005 controversy ==


=== Background ===
As part of its ""West Campus Residential Initiative,"" Cornell decided to relocate approximately 176 parking spots to the area occupied by the Redbud Woods, about 2 blocks from the new dorms. However, in 2001, the Ithaca Common Council named Redbud Woods a historic district. The University sued the city, and in 2005, the New York State Supreme Court's Appellate division ruled in Cornell's favor, allowing construction of the parking lot to proceed.


=== Points of view ===
In the fall of 2004, then University President Jeffrey Lehman had presented three challenges to the University, the third of which was sustainability. Lehman went on to more fully articulate Cornell's ""institutional commitment to sustainability."" Some, including many Cornell faculty, students and Ithaca community members, argued that paving a historic urban green space for a surface parking lot was unsustainable. They suggested that parking needs might be satisfied elsewhere on campus and be further mitigated through demand management, promotion of public transit, and planning.
Those in opposition to construction of the lot also argued that paving the woods might increase localized flooding and allow for the leakage of toxic materials, for example motor oil, into the storm sewer system and ultimately into Cayuga Lake, which supplies drinking water for many living in Tompkins County.
Major protests around the construction of the parking lot continued through the summer of 2005, including the occupation of President Jeffrey Lehman's office on April 28, 2005 by eight students, as well as a protracted direct action occupation of the woods themselves by students, faculty, and community members, in opposition to what appeared to be imminent destruction.  Notably, former Ithaca mayor, and Cornell professor emeritus, Ben Nichols was cited during protests against the deforestation plan. [1]


=== Final agreement ===
On July 18, 2005, Cornell University interim president Hunter Rawlings visited Redbud Woods and signed an agreement between the University and many of the Redbud protesters, effectively ending the dispute, although some independent protests continued. Along with a pledge by Cornell to offer free travel passes for buses to all new students entering the University in the fall of 2005 and 2006 who did not purchase parking permits, the agreement included commitments on the university's part to involve the community more in administration decisions, as well as to engage in constructive dialogue concerning sustainability on campus.  By August 2005 several thousand new students had taken advantage of the free travel passes, which helped to raise demand on the Tompkins Consolidated Area Transit bus system that services Ithaca and the rest of the county


== Media documentation ==
The New York Times published three articles about the Redbud Woods controversy in June and July 2005. Locally, The Ithaca Journal and the Cornell Daily Sun published many articles over the course of 2004–2005 about the protests.


== Aftermath ==
A key point in the negotiated agreement signed by student protesters (but not community members) was that
students receive free travel passes to encourage sustainable transportation.  Cornell began this process for 
incoming students during the semester immediately following the occupation for incoming students, adding to
free passes which were already provided to transfer and graduate students.  Two years later, free passes
for graduate, transfer, and sophomore students were eliminated, and the program only offered going forward to
first year students.A faculty and community committee proposed a memorial
plaque to the Ithaca Common Council in early 2006, to be placed on public land adjacent to
the parking lot.  Despite opposition from Cornell University, the City of Ithaca approved
the plaque on July 5, 2006, and it was installed later that year.  The plaque reads:

Redbud Woods
The land before you was once home to the extended family of Robert H. 
Treman, creator of parks and protector of green spaces throughout Tompkins 
County. The woodland that grew up here was inhabited for decades by diverse 
fauna and more than fifty plant species, including numerous redbud trees. 
Redbud Woods was razed on July 20, 2005 by the Cornell administration to 
build a parking lot.
This plaque has been erected by Ithaca community members in memory of this 
cherished woodland.

"Lal Dighi, Chittagong","Lal Dighi is one of the traditional places in Chittagong city of Bangladesh. Its location is at the end of Jail Road in the city. Lal Dighi is spread over an area of 2.70 acres. On one side of it is Andarkilla. Around it are district council buildings and local bank branches. It belongs to Ward No. 32 of Chittagong City Corporation.


== History ==
In 1761, the British East India Company gained control of Chittagong. At that time Entekali Kachari i.e. Land Tehsil Office (now Metropolitan Police Office) was painted red. It was known as “Lalkuthi” by the people. To the east of this red gate was the jail. It was also painted red and hence came to be known as “Lalghar”. These two buildings were guarded by British hillmen wearing red turbans. Many people think that this is why the buildings are named Lal Ghar and Lal Kuthi. There was a small pond next to the red house and the red hut. At the beginning of English rule in Chittagong, the pond was enlarged and turned into a lake. This Dighi is known as Lal Dighi because there were two red buildings next to it.


== Ownership ==
On the north side of Lal Dighi is a mosque with the year 1939 written on its dome. The name of Taqi Ismail Muhammad is written on it. He is a landlord. His native house was Badarkhali village of Chakaria upazila. He used to spend his free time on the banks of the then open Lal Dighi. He was the guardian of Lal Dighi. Later he handed over the ownership of the Dighi to the Government Muslim High School.


== Ricketts Ghat ==
On the west bank of Lal Dighi was ""Ricketts Ghat"". The ghat was built by the zamindars of Chittagong under the command of Sir Henry Ricketts who served as the Commissioner of Chittagong from 1941 to 1948. Harvey was Collector of Chittagong in 1831-1839. He started the survey work with 32 Deputy Collectors and a few Survey Amins. In the survey, he calculated Kani in 18 Gandas instead of 20 Gandas. Everyone was so upset with him that people attacked him in Anwara Thana. He then ordered the soldiers to fire. On receiving this news the authorities sent for Rickett. During the survey of 1200 Maghir, he benefited the people of Chittagong and became respected by all. After the death of Chittagong Sessions Judge Todel in the 19th century, his body was cremated on the north side of Ricketts Ghat. The pillar erected in his memory was later demolished.


== Maidan ==
The entire area from the foot of the Metropolitan Police Headquarters hill to the foot of Pari Hill in the west was then known as the Municipal Maidan. In 1887, the statue of Queen Victoria was installed in this Maidan. The statue was removed during the freedom movement in the 1940s. After the completion of the North-South road at the end of the 19th century, the Municipal Maidan was divided into two parts. The eastern side is converted into a public playground. When the Muslim High School was established, the ground became the playground of the Muslim High School. This field is now known as Laldighir Maidan.In 1966, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman organized a public meeting at Lal Dighi maidan to highlight the importance of six points to the people of East Pakistan.On January 24, 1988, 24 people were killed due to firing on the orders of the then Commissioner of Chittagong Metropolitan Police at Sheikh Hasina's public meeting held at Maidan. A case was filed against the commissioner 4 years after the incident and the verdict was delivered in 2020.


== Legend ==
There is a legend in the mouth of the people of Chittagong about the incident of Lal Dighi. Once a day laborer's daughter went down to bathe in that pond. Suddenly he was chained and taken to an underwater country. Actually, it was a king's court. That king's marriage was fixed with Lal Begum. One day the king wanted to see Lal Begum but it was reported that Lal Begum had run away from her home with a slave. The king did not know this news at that time. So Mazur's daughter was brought to act as Lal Begum with Badshah. In many contexts, the king gets to know the real identity of the girl. On the orders of the angry king, everyone started looking for the real Lal Begum. Then it was known that he was in the fort of the Portuguese two hundred cubits away from the lake of Andar Qilla. The king attacked that fort. The water of Dighi turned red with many murders. The king was defeated in that battle. Everyone ran away. Still, he stayed on the banks of the Dighi with the hope of rescuing Lal Begum.


== Events ==
On the 12th of Baishakh in 1910, Abdul Jabbar organized the first Bolikhela on the banks of Lal Dighi. Since then, every year on the 12th of Baisakh, Jobbarer Boli Khela is held on the banks of Lal Dighi.

Thalassodes immissaria,"Thalassodes immissaria is a moth of the family Geometridae first described by Francis Walker in 1861. It is found in the Oriental tropics of China, India, Myanmar,  Sri Lanka, Hong Kong, Japan, Borneo, Vietnam, Sumatra, Sulawesi and the Ryukyu Islands. The populations in Ryukyu were often classified as a subspecies - Thalassodes immissaria intaminata Inoue, 1971. However, in 2005 this subspecies was upgraded to a distinct species, which can be distinguished from immissaria by careful examination of the male genitalia. It is a green moth with faint white lines. There is a very narrow yellowish line border on the wings. Male have plumose (feather-like) antennae, female has filiform (thread-like) antennae. It is very similar to other congener species, therefore identification should done through examination of genitalis. In the male, the genitalia possess a long, tongue-like valva basal process and a tongue-like harpe. The caterpillar feeds on Mangifera indica, Lagerstroemia, Nephelium,
Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Dimocarpus longan and Litchi chinensis.

Melania the Elder,"Melania the Elder, Latin Melania Maior (born in Spain, ca. 350 - died in Jerusalem before 410 or in ca. 417) was a Desert Mother who was an influential figure in the Christian ascetic movement (the Desert Fathers and Mothers) that sprang up in the generation after the Emperor Constantine made Christianity a legal religion of the Roman Empire. She was a contemporary of, and well known to, Abba Macarius and other Desert Fathers in Egypt, Jerome, Augustine of Hippo, Paulinus of Nola (her cousin or cousin-in-law; he gives a colorful description of her visit to Nola in his Letters), and Evagrius of Pontus, and she founded two religious communities on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem. She stands out for the convent she founded for herself and the monastery she established in honour of Rufinus of Aquileia, which belongs to the earliest Christian communities, and because she promoted the asceticism which she, as a follower of Origen, considered indispensable for salvation.


== Life ==
Melania the Elder (ca. 350 - ca. 410) was born in Hispania and became one of the wealthiest citizens of the empire. Her father, Marcellinus, was of consular rank and she was related to Paulinus of Nola. She was married at fourteen, and moved with her husband (probably Valerius Maximus signo Basilius of the powerful patrician family of gens Valeria, or possibly a politician named Maximus) to the suburbs of Rome. Her husband and two out of three sons had died by the time she was twenty-two. She became a Christian in Rome and, leaving her son, Valerius Publicola, with a guardian, set off to Alexandria, accompanied by her servants, to join other Christian ascetics to visit the monks at Nitria.She stayed with the monks in the desert near Alexandria, Egypt (today the area is known as Wadi Natroun) for about six months. When persecution broke out after the death of Bishop Athanasius in 373 and many of the monks were exiled to Diocaesaraea in Palestine, Melania followed and supported them financially. The governor had her briefly imprisoned, but released her when he realized her social status. She built a convent in Jerusalem, and a monastery on the Mount of Olives for the monk and theologian Rufinus of Aquileia.Because of her involvement as a pro-Origenist in the controversy over Origen in the 390s, Jerome was especially vitriolic about her, punning on her name and calling her ""black in name and black in nature."" (He tried to expunge his earlier lavish praises of her from his writings.) Palladius of Galatia described her as ""a very learned lady who loved the world"".Around the year 400 she left for Rome to see her son, who had married Caeionia Albina, daughter of Caeionius Rufius Albinus. Due to her influence, her granddaughter, known as Melania the Younger, would later take up the religious life. She also visited Paulinus and Therasia of Nola and brought him a relic of the True Cross. Augustine of Hippo wrote Paulinus that his kinswoman was in North Africa when her son, Valerius, died in 406.She is regarded as a saint and her feast day is June 8.


== Influence ==
She was a spiritual mentor to Evagrius of Pontus, author of some texts found in the Eastern Orthodox Philokalia. She persuaded him to go to Egypt to join the desert ascetics and carried on a correspondence with him while he was there.

"Wagoner, Oklahoma","Wagoner is a city in Wagoner County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 8,323 at the 2010 census, compared to the figure of 7,669 recorded in 2000. It is the county seat of Wagoner County. Wagoner became the first city incorporated in Indian Territory on January 4, 1896.


== History ==
Wagoner is along the path of the Texas Road cattle trail, and the later Jefferson Highway of the early National Trail System, both roughly along the route of U.S. Route 69 through Oklahoma today. The town began as a small community at the intersection of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas (MKT) Railway and the Kansas and Arkansas Valley Railway (later the Missouri Pacific Railway), when William McAnally, a foreman for the MKT built a small hotel at this isolated location in June 1887. By the next summer others had built two more hotels and two general stores. The town was named for railroad dispatcher Henry ""Big Foot"" Wagoner, who had reported the need for a railroad switch nearby to accommodate the shipment of logs and hay. The switch had been previously named ""Wagoner's Switch."" The switch soon relocated to the town and caused the development of a major cattle shipping business.By 1894, the community had 642 names in a local census. A local newspaper began promoting the town in 1895, encouraging more people to move to there. By 1896, there were approximately 1,500 residents. In the fall of 1895, the community formed a commission that circulated a petition requesting incorporation under the statutes of Arkansas. Incorporation was granted by the U. S. District Court on January 4, 1896, making Wagoner the first city incorporated in Indian Territory.A privately funded courthouse was built in 1897, which housed a newly created U. S. Western District Court. The Dawes Commission turned Indian Territory land from tribal to individual ownership by members of each tribe. The individuals were allowed to sell their land to non-Indians, causing a real estate boom in farmland around the area. By statehood, the city had 2,950 residents and was named as the county seat of Wagoner County.In April 1914 Wagoner was the location of a brutal lynching of a 17 year old African American girl.The boom continued through 1910, when the population reached 4,018. The MKT had located a division headquarters in the city, which then had three railroad trunk lines and twenty passenger trains a day. Industries included three grain elevators, a cotton gin, cotton oil mill, iron foundry, hardwood company, cement plant, and roller mill. However, the boom ended in 1913, when the MKT moved its division headquarters to Muskogee. The oil boom farther west and later, the Great Depression, caused a further decline in the city's economy and population.World War II started a revival of Wagoner's fortunes. The city lay between two war-related Federal Government projects: Camp Gruber to the south and the Oklahoma Ordnance Works to the north.After the war, several small manufacturing industries took root. Completion of the nearby Fort Gibson Lake in 1950 stimulated the economy and turned Wagoner into a sports and retirement center. The McLellan-Kerr navigational channel made the agricultural area accessible by barges, stimulating farm-related businesses. Highway improvements created Wagoner as a suburban area for Tulsa and Muskogee.

Jannabi (band),"Jannabi (Korean: 잔나비; stylized in all caps) is a South Korean indie rock band that was formed in 2012 and debuted in 2014 under the independent record label Peponi Music, whose core membership consisted of vocalist Choi Jung-hoon and guitarist Kim Do-hyung. Originally a quintet, the band has undergone several lineup changes, with Choi and Kim remaining the only constant members since its inception. Currently, the duo has expanded to include session musicians. They are recognized for their live performances and self-produced songs infused with Korean lyricism. Though their sound has diversified throughout their career, their music is characterized by a fusion of pop, classical music elements and nostalgic overtones. Their songwriting, often inspired by personal experiences and literature, mostly focus on themes of youth and coming of age.Jannabi achieved critical and commercial success in 2019 with their album Legend, which, along with its lead single ""For Lovers Who Hesitate,"" reached number one on the Circle Digital Chart, received platinum certifications for both streaming and download in South Korea, and won two Korean Music Awards. Praised for breaking new ground in the 2019 Korean popular music scene that is almost dominated by idol groups, the band has since become one of the most prominent rock groups in their native country, experiencing consistent commercial success on the music charts, concerts and festivals.Jannabi has released a total of three studio albums, three extended plays and one reissue thus far, three of which have peaked in the top ten of the Circle Album Chart.

The group's name, Jannabi, is an archaic Korean word for monkey and the band was originally composed of neighborhood friends from Bundang who were all born in 1992, the Year of the Monkey in the Chinese zodiac. According to Choi Jung-hoon, the name was suggested by their close friend. They introduce themselves as a ""Group Sound"" rather than a band. The term was used to refer to a band in the Korean music scene in the 1960s and 1970s, signifying the group's desire to restore the classics of the band's music.

All the values that you have learned to be right so far, and that you held and ran vigorously in your arms, are overturned in an instant, and there is no need to embrace them anymore. It's not just me and my friends that it has become an illusion.""Jannabi actively collaborated with excellent artists in 2018. The first was ""Lilac (feat. Choi Jung-hoon of Jannabi)"" from Changmo extended play The Moment of Contact, and the second was ""On the Path (Feat. Jannabi, Kim Yoon-hee)"" from Lee Moon-sae sixteenth studio album Between Us.On December 21, 2018, Jannabi released the digital single ""Made in Christmas"" featuring Lee Su-hyun of AKMU.

==== Controversies and Young-hyun's departure ====
Following Jannabi's rise to fame, the members became subject of controversies. On May 24, 2019, keyboardist Yoo Young-hyun voluntarily left the band after he admitted to reports of him being a bully during his school years. The following day, Choi Jung-hoon was accused of participating in the management of a company run by his father, who is under investigation for fraud. Peponi Music denied the allegations and expressed that they would take legal action against those who spread groundless rumors on Choi. The prosecution later stated that an investigation on Choi was not necessary. Choi posted a personal statement on Instagram to apologize for Young-hyun's school violence controversy and clarify the false reports about him. The netizen who spread false information about Choi was later fined ₩5 million in total by the Suwon District Court for defamation. Peponi Music added that the company was filing additional separate criminal complaints against those who have posted malicious comments and continue to spread false information about him and the band.

On the band's musical style, Music Critic Jung Min-jae of KMA writes:

Jannabi's achievements were attributed to sophisticated music. The vivid melodies of each song, the lyrics that delicately convey the lyricism unique to the Korean language, and the vintage sound that determined the color of the group perfectly matched. The orchestration was also stunning. The expressive power of Choi Jung-hoon, a vocalist who can be said to be unrivaled, is a decisive factor in completing the music. This album revived the public's sensitivity to music, which had been temporarily forgotten by the pursuit of hip and sophistication. This is evidenced by the remarkable increase in retro ballads and long song titles in the music industry after the success of ""For Lovers Who Hesitate."" Legend changed the landscape of the music industry in 2019.

== Artistry ==


=== Musical style and development ===

Jannabi has typically been associated with variety of genres, including indie rock, psychedelic rock, folk, pop rock, chamber pop, and art rock with incisive lyrics and songwriting style suitable for easy listening. They incorporated the nuances of the roots of Korean popular music originally called gayo and classical music elements in innovative ways. In a 2017 interview with The Korea Herald, defining the band's music, the members said: “Sound that comes from your parents’ car.” In a 2022 interview with Yonhap News Agency, Choi Jung-hoon shared that their music represents a lot of Korean sentiment, saying: ""Our song seems to explain a lot and dig into our emotions too much to listen to, but on the contrary, it allowed us to protect our music."" Music journalist Son Hye-min wrote: ""Jannabi's charm is the atmosphere of the song that seems to create nostalgia for the past, the lyrics that can be a poem if you spread it out on paper and the emotion that contains more than just saying it is tacky.""Other critics praise the universality the band pursues, with Jo Eun-byul of Sports Seoul saying: ""The lyrics engraved with each stitch reminded one of a literary work, and the classic melody spanned generations."" The Korean Cultural Center New York writes: ""There is something else which makes the band's music powerful: going beyond the compulsion to be dedicated to a single genre. Its free-spirited music was able to set such big milestones because Jannabi has made efforts to put their own stories in their music, their stories of growing up as a band act as a perspective to see the world."" With its lyrically wistful, vintage-pop artistry that appeals to people across all generations, their musicality has been recognized by fellow artists, especially remarkable figures in the K-pop industry such as Lee Moon-sae, Kim Chang-wan, Yoon Jong-shin and Yoo Hee-yeol to the extent that they are called ""artist's artist.""Their repertoire expanded to include a broad variety of music styles with their third full-length album The Land of Fantasy (2021). Described as an album that revealed the ""virtues that rock music of the past has sought after,"" it resembled a musical drama while embedding progressive rock's ambition to become more colorful and grander. The album with a storyline, showcased their ""complete musical freedom"" from the success of previous works and explored genres such as baroque pop and rock opera.


=== Songwriting ===
Jannabi is a band that writes and performs their own music. At their outset in 2014, Jannabi's songs were the product of Choi Jung-hoon, Kim Do-hyung and Yoo Young-hyun's collaborative songwriting. In the following years, Choi became the sole lyricist of the band, whose song examples include ""See Your Eyes,"" ""Summer,"" ""She"" and ""For Lovers Who Hesitate."" Starting 2020, with the release of Jannabi's Small Pieces I, Choi and Kim have established a songwriting partnership to which they share credits on compositions and arrangements. In 2022, due to military service of the members, Choi continued to release music under the name of Jannabi with him in solitary songwriting.The band's lyrical content and composition tended to be classical, introspective and poetically oriented that unraveled the ""complex emotions of youth"" and ""awakened empathy"" among them. Rather than giving an impact to a specific single, many of their albums are conceptual. Other themes of their music include romance, friendship, community, self-awareness and fictional narratives.


=== Influences ===

Jannabi names Sanulrim and The Beatles as their major musical influences. As the main songwriter of the band, Choi Jung-hoon cited how Kim Chang-wan's lyrics convey emotions; “Words are like the lyrics of a song, so you listen carefully, and even if you say the same thing, it gives you a tremble.” In 2021, they made the song ""A Ballad of Non Le Jon"" to pay homage to The Beatles. Of the song that was described as The Beatles parody music, Choi shared that it reflected on the time when they did not look back and just aimed for the top freely and cynically, saying, ""We watched The Beatles documentary. They say that they endured the time in the boring and dull underground waiting room while shouting ‘to the topper most of the popper most!.’ There was a time when I thought that was cool. It is a song depicting our image on a day when we lost our direction."" They have also cited Electric Light Orchestra as an influence in creating modern rock with oldness in terms of musical texture.Other early influences included Anglophone rock groups such as Queen, Simon & Garfunkel, Oasis, Blur, The Moody Blues, The Beach Boys, Procol Harum, Led Zeppelin and U2. As a busking band oriented toward the past, they were influenced by some of the artists from South Korea and covered their songs in the 1970s to 90s, including Crying Nut, Lee Moon-sae, Kim Kwang-seok and Yoo Jae-ha.

Uranium mining in Arizona,"Uranium mining in Arizona has taken place since 1918.  Prior to the uranium boom of the late 1940s, uranium in Arizona was a byproduct of vanadium mining of the mineral carnotite.


== Carrizo Mountains ==
Uranium mining started in 1918 in the Carrizo Mountains as a byproduct of vanadium mining.  The district is in Apache County, in the northeast corner of Arizona.  The uranium and vanadium occur as carnotite in sandstone of the Salt Wash member of the Morrison Formation (Jurassic).  Production stopped in 1921.  Another period of mining took place from 1941 to 1966, producing 360,000 pounds (160 metric tons) of uranium oxide (U3O8).


== Monument Valley ==
A Navajo discovered uranium in 1942 in Monument Valley on the Navajo Nation in northeast Arizona.  The first mine in the district opened in 1948.  Uranium and uranium-vanadium minerals occur in fluvial channels of the Shinarump Sandstone member of the Triassic Chinle Formation.  Ore deposits are associated with carbonized wood in the sandstone.  Mining stopped in the Monument Valley district in 1969, after producing 8.7 million pounds (3900 metric tons) of uranium oxide, more than has been produced from any other uranium mining district in Arizona.  In 2005 the Navajo Nation declared a moratorium on uranium mining on the reservation, for environmental and health reasons.


== Lukachukai Mountains ==
In 1948, a copper deposit in the Moenkopi Formation was discovered to have economic concentrations of uranium.  The deposit was in the Lukachukai Mountains of Apache County.  Uranium totaling 3.5 million pounds (1600 metric tons) of U3O8 was produced from 1950 until the mines closed in 1968.


== Cameron district ==
Navajo prospector Hosteen Nez found uranium near Cameron in Coconino County in 1950.  The uranium is in the Kayenta Formation and the Chinle Formation.  Production was from 1950 to 1963, and totaled 1.2 million pounds (540 metric tons) of U3O8.


== Collapse breccia pipes ==
Uranium was discovered in the Orphan copper mine near the south rim of the Grand Canyon in 1950.  The mine has been private property since 1906, and is today completely surrounded by Grand Canyon National Park.  The discovery led to the finding of uranium in other collapse breccia pipes in northern Arizona.  The breccia pipes were formed when overlying rocks collapsed into caverns formed in the Mississippian Redwall Limestone.  The pipes are typically 300 feet (91 m) in diameter, and may extend up to 3,000 feet (910 m) vertically.


== Sierra Ancha district ==
Uranium mining started in 1953 from deposits in the Precambrian Dripping Spring Quartzite in Gila County.  The uranium mineral is most commonly uraninite, which occurs with pyrite, marcasite, and chalcopyrite.  The orebodies are in veins or strataform deposits within one-half mile of diabase intrusions.


== Date Creek Basin ==
The Anderson uranium deposit was discovered in 1955 by an airborne gamma-radiation survey.  Small amounts of ore were produced from 1955 to 1959.  Uranium is associated with organic material in carbonaceous Miocene siltstones and mudstones of lacustrine and paludal origin of the Chapin Wash formation of the Date Creek Basin in Yavapai, La Paz, and Mohave counties.  The Anderson mine is now owned by Concentric Energy Corp. which is doing extensive development work to bring it into production.


== Porphyry copper byproduct ==
For some years starting in 1980, the Twin Buttes copper mine in Pima County recovered uranium as a byproduct from leach solutions recovering copper from waste material.


== Uranium mining and native people ==

After the end of World War II, the United States encouraged uranium mining to build nuclear weapons stockpiles. Large uranium deposits were found on and near the Navajo Reservation, and mining companies hired many Navajos. Disregarding the health risks of radiation exposure, the private companies and the United States Atomic Energy Commission failed to inform the Navajo workers about the dangers and to regulate the mining to minimize contamination. As more data was collected, they were slow to take appropriate action for the workers.
Studies show that the Navajo mine workers and numerous families on the reservation have suffered high rates of disease from environmental contamination, but for decades, industry and the government failed to regulate or improve conditions, or inform workers of the dangers. As high rates of illness began to occur, workers were often unsuccessful in court cases seeking compensation, and the states at first did not officially recognize radon illness. In 1990 the US Congress passed the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, to settle such cases and provide needed compensation.
In 2008 the US Congress authorized a five-year, multi-agency cleanup of uranium contamination on the Navajo Nation reservation; identification and treatment of contaminated water and structures has been the first priority. Certain water sources have been closed, and numerous contaminated buildings have been taken down. By the summer of 2011, EPA had nearly completed the first major project of removal of 20,000 cubic yards of contaminated earth from the Skyline Mine area.
There is a current producing uranium mine in the Whetstone Mountains of Cochise County. The mine has restarted and has been in operation for five years. The government has also closed down about 4 sq mi (10 km2) around the mountain which is all was public lands.


== Current activity ==
There are currently no producing uranium mines in Arizona.  Denison Mines planned to begin mining its Arizona One mine in 2007.  The deposit is in a breccia pipe on the Colorado Plateau of northern Arizona.  In March 2011, the State of Arizona issued air and water permits to Denison which would allow uranium mining to resume at three locations north of the Grand Canyon, subject to federal approval.As of May 2015, Energy Fuels was preparing to mine uranium at its Canyon mine, a deposit on US Forest Service land, six miles from the south rim of the Grand Canyon. The deposit was discovered in the 1970s, and partially developed as an underground mine under a Forest Service permit in the late 1980s, but never put into production. The Canyon deposit holds enough ore to yield an estimated 1.63 million pounds of uranium concentrate U3O8. A coalition of groups, including the Havasupai Tribe, the Sierra Club, the Grand Canyon Trust, and the Center for Biological Diversity, sued the Forest Service to stop the reactivation of the mine. In April 2015 the US District Court for the District of Arizona ruled in favor of the Forest Service and Energy Fuels, and allowed work on the mine to proceed. The plaintiffs plan to appeal.Energy Fuels has also been developing its Pine Nut mine located north of the Grand Canyon since 1986.


== Ban on uranium mining near Grand Canyon National Park ==
In July 2009 Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar announced a two-year ban on new mining on federal land in an area of approximately 1 million acres (4,000 km2) surrounding Grand Canyon National Park.  Although the ban is on all mining, the main effect is on exploration and development of breccia-pipe uranium deposits.  Those claims on which commercial mineral deposits have already been discovered are exempt from the ban.  During the two-year ban the Department of the Interior will study a proposed 20-year ban on new mining in the area.In January 2012, secretary Ken Salazar approved a 20-year ban on mining around the Grand Canyon. This decision preserves about “1 million acres near the Grand Canyon, an area known to be rich in high-grade uranium ore reserves” and has generated a number of different responses The ban is supported by the president of the League of Conservation voters, Gene Karpinski: ""Extending the current moratorium on new uranium mining claims will protect drinking water for millions downstream.” Many environmental groups agree that such mining would endanger the Colorado River as a source of water not only for wildlife, but for tens of millions of people; Phoenix, Las Vegas and Los Angeles rely on the river for drinking water. With areas of contamination already noted in United States environmental impact reports on old mining operations, opposition fears that allowing mining to expand and continue would increase the levels of contamination in the river.Supporters of the mining around the Grand Canyon argue that large-scale contamination from accidents involving mining are unlikely. According to an Arizona Geological survey, “60 metric tons of dissolved uranium is naturally carried by the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon in an average year"".  J.E. Spencer, AZGS Senior Geologist, argues that in one hypothetical, worst-case scenario experiment, a truck carrying “thirty metric tons (66,000 pounds) of one-percent uranium ore” spilling and washing into the Colorado River increases the natural uranium level in the river by an insignificant amount. Providing further data on uranium levels in the Colorado River, a 2010 United States Geological survey found that the river carries about 40 to 80 tons through the canyon each year.In 2011 more than 200 Arizona small businesses addressed postcards to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar sign the 20-year ban on new uranium mining near the Grand Canyon, to preserve thousands of tourism-related jobs. President of the League of Conservation voters Gene Karpinski agreed that protecting the tourism industry, which relies on the Grand Canyon, is more economically important than mining near the canyon. Coconino County Supervisor Carl Taylor argued that Uranium mining poses a great threat to tourism in the canyon and surrounding areas. Some believe that one mining accident could be destructive for tourism in the highly popular park. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar states that “the Grand Canyon attracts more than 4 million visitors a year and generates an estimated $3.5 billion in economic activity”. Salazar also stated that people from the United States and even all over the world come to visit and see the Grand Canyon. He believes that allowing mining in this area to be pursued would negatively impact this tourism industry.Some argue that not allowing the mining to occur destroys years of resource development. Hal Quinn, president and CEO of the National Mining Association states that banning mining in the Grand Canyon only deprives the United States of energy and minerals that are critical to the survival and strength of the US economy. The mining industry agrees, believing that a ban on mining around the Grand Canyon would negatively impact Arizona's local economy and the United States’ energy independence. Jonathan DuHamel states that a permanent ban on mining would eliminate hundreds of potential jobs. Former presidential candidate John McCain argues that opposition to the mining provoked by environmental groups who have the goal of killing mining and grazing jobs throughout Arizona.The increasing number of claims that began in 2006 was a direct result of the rising uranium prices that began that year. Higher uranium prices encouraged mining companies to locate and mine new deposits around the canyon area. In 2011, when the price of uranium lowered about 35%, companies continued to explore the area.

P. A. Ediriweera,"Piyadasa Ariyasena Ediriweera (1915–1985) was a Sri Lankan travel agent, journalist and entrepreneur. Ediriweera Is credited as establishing Sri Lanka's first travel agency.


== Journalism ==
Ediriweera was born in Ahangama, Sri Lanka in October 1915. He left school to work as a 'cub' reporter in the 'Daily News' as provincial correspondent in Ahangama and later joined The Times of Ceylon as a journalist in the Colombo office working his way up to being a war correspondent and making influential friends and contacts in the international press and in particular at The New York Times. His subsequent success is attributed to publicity stemming from a cocktail party held to receive him by his American war correspondent friends at the Waldorf Astoria hotel, to which members of the American travel industry were invited. Ediriweera is reputed to have generated interest through his contacts at The New York Times writing articles on Sri Lanka targeting the American reader, and an advertising campaign,.


== Travel industry ==
Ediriweera formed the company Ceylon Tours in July 1946 with Justin Kotalawala (brother of Sir John Kotelawala) as Chairman, Ediriweera as Managing Director, with Directors DB Dhanapala (who worked with him at the Times group as a reporter), Rosaline Koch and D.P Abeywardena. 
His business interests expanded and diversified. In 1949, Ediriweera opened an office at the Queens Hotel in Kandy and operated vehicles in Colombo from the Colombo Swimming Club. In the latter part of that year, he leased a hotel in Anuradhapura called Grand Hotel and acquired the island resort at San Michelle in Bolgoda which belonged to Sir John Kotelawala who leased it to Ceylon Tours. He later bought and operated the Mount Lavinia Hotel (where parts of Bridge on the River Kwai was filmed), Grand Oriental Hotel (Taprobane Hotel) and the Times of Ceylon where he became chairman of the board.


== Film industry ==
Ediriweera visited Los Angeles in 1954 and met with executives of Universal Studios, United Artists and Horizon pictures who were persuaded to visit Ceylon to consider it a venue for film shoots. He also visited the United Kingdom, leading to the movie Outcast of the Island (1951) directed by Carol Reed  being shot on locations in Ceylon in 1951 (the first British film to be shot in Ceylon). this was followed by Planters Wife by Ken Anakinin 1952, Purple Plain in 1954 directed by Robert Parish and starring Gregory Peck, Elephant Walk (1954) directed by William Dieterle, the Academy Award-winning film The Bridge on the River Kwai filmed in Sri Lanka in 1957 starring William Holden and Sir Alec Guinness, Never So Few (1959) directed by John Sturgers, and Kommissarx (1966) directed by Rudolf Zehetgmber. Ediriweera is said to have accompanied the film's director David Lean to meet Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike to secure permission for the film to be shot in Sri Lanka./> His daughter Ranjini Suranimala (who married DB Suranimala son of his friend DB Dhanapala and youngest son Chandra Ediriweera acted in the film Wer stirbt schon gerne unter Palmen? (1974).

Kathryn D. Sullivan,"Kathryn Dwyer Sullivan (born October 3, 1951) is an American geologist, oceanographer, and former NASA astronaut and US Navy officer. She was a crew member on three Space Shuttle missions.
A graduate of University of California, Santa Cruz, in the United States, and Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, Canada—where she earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree in geology in 1978—Sullivan was selected as one of the six women among the 35 astronaut candidate in NASA Astronaut Group 8, the first group to include women. During her training, she became the first woman to be certified to wear a United States Air Force pressure suit, and on July 1, 1979, she set an unofficial sustained American aviation altitude record for women. During her first mission, STS-41-G, Sullivan performed the first extra-vehicular activity (EVA) by an American woman. On her second, STS-31, she helped deploy the Hubble Space Telescope. On the third, STS-45, she served as Payload Commander on the first Spacelab mission dedicated to NASA's Mission to Planet Earth.
Sullivan was Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) after being confirmed by the US Senate on March 6, 2014. Her tenure ended on January 20, 2017, after which she was designated as the 2017 Charles A. Lindbergh Chair of Aerospace History at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum, and also served as a Senior Fellow at the Potomac Institute for Policy Studies. On June 7, 2020, Sullivan became the first woman to dive into the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of Earth's oceans. In September 2021, President Joe Biden appointed her to the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.


== Early life and education ==
Kathryn Dwyer Sullivan was born in Paterson, New Jersey, on October 3, 1951, the daughter of Donald Paul Sullivan and his wife Barbara, née Kelly. She had a brother, Grant. In 1958 the family moved to the San Fernando Valley in California, where her father worked in the aerospace industry for Marquardt Corporation. She was in the first grade at Havenhurst Elementary School, where Sally Ride was a classmate, but the school closed in 1958 to make way for Van Nuys Airport, and neither woman could recall meeting the other. During her school years she was a girl scout.Sullivan graduated from William Howard Taft High School in the Woodland Hills district of Los Angeles, California, in 1969. She took both French and German in high school, and resolved to have a career in the foreign service. She chose to enter the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), on account of its renowned Russian studies program. The university required that humanities students take three science classes and vice versa. She chose to take courses in marine biology, topology and oceanography. She enjoyed these, and altered her course to take in more science subjects. She was an exchange student at the University of Bergen in Norway for the 1971–1972 school year and the two summers around it, and decided to change her major to oceanography. She was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in Earth Sciences from UCSC in 1973, and a Doctor of Philosophy in geology from Dalhousie University and the Bedford Institute of Oceanography in Nova Scotia, Canada, in 1978, writing her doctoral thesis on The structure and evolution of the Newfoundland Basin under the supervision of Michael John Keen. While at Dalhousie, she participated in several oceanographic expeditions that studied the floors of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.


== NASA career ==


=== Selection and training ===
When Sullivan visited her family for Christmas in 1976, her brother Grant, an aerospace engineer and corporate jet pilot, told her that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) had issued a call for applications for a new group of astronauts. NASA had made it known that it was interested in recruiting women, and Grant encouraged her to apply. He had applied for both pilot and mission specialist positions. After she returned to Nova Scotia she saw a NASA ad in a science journal, and decided to apply. She reasoned that the Space Shuttle was a kind of research vessel, but her dream was still to descend to the ocean floor in a submersible. That prospect came closer when she received an offer from William B. F. Ryan from the Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University to join his team exploring the ocean in the submersible DSV Alvin. Ryan had been an unsuccessful finalist for NASA Astronaut Group 6 in 1967, and he counseled her to wait for NASA to call. They both felt that the odds on being accepted were long, but Sullivan did not join Ryan's team while she waited to hear about her selection.Grant's application was unsuccessful, but Kathryn was invited to come to the Johnson Space Center (JSC) for a week of interviews and physical examinations commencing on November 14, 1977. She was the only woman in this group of twenty-five finalists. Over the course of a week she was given physical and psychological examinations, and was interviewed by a selection panel chaired by George Abbey. She was successful, and her selection as one of the six women among the 35 members of NASA Astronaut Group 8 was publicly announced on January 16, 1978. It was the first astronaut group to include women. Sullivan was one of the three members of the group (the others being Sally Ride and Steve Hawley) for whom NASA astronaut would be their first full-time paid job since leaving university.
On August 31, 1979, NASA announced that the 35 astronaut candidates had completed their training and evaluation, and were now officially astronauts, qualified for selection on space flight crews. To mark the occasion the Chief of the Astronaut Office, John Young, presented each of them with a silver NASA astronaut pin; they would become eligible for a gold one after they had flown in space. Like other astronaut groups before them, each was given a particular assignment. Sullivan helped develop systems management checklists for the first Space Shuttle flights. To give the newcomers more experience, they were periodically rotated to different jobs, so after nine months she became a mission manager at NASA's High Altitude Research Project, based at nearby Ellington Air Force Base. She became the first woman to be certified to wear a United States Air Force pressure suit, and on July 1, 1979, she set an unofficial sustained American aviation altitude record for women of 19,000 metres (63,000 ft) during a four-hour flight in a NASA WB-57F reconnaissance aircraft.For the first Space Shuttle mission, STS-1, Sullivan was assigned to media support, working with Vic Ratner and Bob Walker on ABC News Radio. For the STS-2 mission she flew in the back seat of a NASA Northrop T-38 Talon chase plane piloted by fellow astronaut Hoot Gibson, photographing the Space Shuttle tiles to verify that none had been damaged. She was then assigned to the support crew at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), along with fellow astronauts Steve Hawley, Loren Shriver and Don Williams, for the next four Space Shuttle missions.


=== STS-41-G ===
In July 1983 Sullivan joined the Mission Development group, which organised and supervised the development of payloads for future missions that did not yet have a crew assigned to them. She was assigned the Office of Space and Terrestrial Applications' OSTA-3 satellite and the Orbital Refueling System (ORS). The objective of the latter was to demonstrate that the Space Shuttle could be used to refuel a satellite in orbit, thereby extending its useful life. For this the aging Landsat 4 satellite was chosen. In September 1983 she was officially assigned to this mission, which was designated STS-41-G.Sally Ride was also assigned to this mission, so it became the first time that two women were in space together. The mission lifted off from the KSC in the Space Shuttle Challenger  on October 5, 1984. Sullivan performed the first extra-vehicular activity (EVA) by an American woman on October 11, 1984. With fellow mission specialist David Leestma, she performed a 3.5-hour spacewalk in which they operated the ORS to show that a satellite could be refueled in orbit. They installed a valve into a satellite propulsion system that mimicked that of Landsat 4 and transferred 59 kilograms (130 lb) of hydrazine to it using the ORS. This demonstrated that the procedure could be performed with a real satellite.During the eight-day mission, the crew also deployed the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite, conducted scientific observations of Earth with the OSTA-3 pallet (including the SIR-B radar, FILE, and MAPS experiments) and large format camera (LFC), and conducted several in-cabin experiments as well as activating eight ""Getaway Special"" canisters. STS-41G completed 132 orbits of Earth in 197.5 hours, before landing back at the KSC on October 13, 1984.


=== STS-61-J ===
In September 1985 Sullivan was assigned to the STS-61-J mission, which was scheduled to deploy the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in August 1986. The original intention was that the HST would be periodically retrieved by the Space Shuttle and returned to Earth for maintenance, although some components were designed for servicing in-orbit. In 1984 NASA management decided this would be too dangerous and too costly, and that the HST would instead be maintained in-orbit by periodic servicing missions for up to fifteen years. Convinced that NASA would attempt to fix any component that jeopardized the HST's mission whether it had been designated as serviceable or not, Sullivan pressed for as many components as possible to be replaceable or amenable to in-orbit servicing. Working with fellow astronaut Bruce McCandless II and NASA and Lockheed Corporation engineers, she ensured that there would be a complete set of tools and procedures for as many HST maintenance missions as possible.The STS-61-J mission was cancelled after the January 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, but the crew continued to work on the mission objectives. At this point, just fourteen systems were designated as ""on-orbit maintainable"". There were up to twelve units in each one, so forty-three were designated as Block I ""on-orbit replaceable units"" (ORUs). Lockheed produced two lists of additional units that could be modified to be serviceable; there were twenty-six systems and fifty-one units in Block II and eight systems and sixteen units in Block III. With more time available, an attempt was now made to work through these. Meanwhile Sullivan served as capsule communicator (CAPCOM) for STS-26, the Space Shuttle's October 1988 return-to-flight mission. She chose the wakeup music, including a contribution from Robin Williams, who provided a pastiche of his Good Morning, Vietnam radio greeting. She continued working as CAPCOM on the STS-27 and STS-29 missions.


=== STS-31 ===
At the end of March 1989, Sullivan returned to working on the HST mission, which was now designated STS-31. The crew was the same, except that Loren Shriver replaced Young as mission commander. STS-31 was launched from KSC, on April 24, 1990. During this five-day mission, crew members aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery  deployed the HST, and conducted middeck experiments involving the study of protein crystal growth, polymer membrane processing, and the effects of weightlessness and magnetic fields on an ion arc. They also operated several cameras, including the IMAX cargo bay camera, for Earth observations. Their apogee of 617 kilometers (333 nmi) above Earth was the highest yet achieved by a Space Shuttle orbiter. (It was later exceeded by the STS-82 HST servicing mission.)The HST was deployed on the second day using Discovery's Canadarm with the Shuttle doors opened towards the ground. In case McCandless and Sullivan had to perform an EVA, the Shuttle's cabin pressure was lowered from 101 kilopascals (14.7 psi) to 28 kilopascals (4.1 psi). At one point McCandless and Sullivan donned their space suits and entered the airlock to perform an emergency EVA to help deploy the Hubble's solar arrays, but this was not required, as the engineers were able to deploy them with a series of commands from Earth. Discovery followed the HST for the next two days in case intervention was required. After making 76 orbits of Earth in 121 hours, Discovery landed at Edwards Air Force Base in California, on April 29, 1990.


=== STS-45 ===
Sullivan served as Payload Commander on STS-45, the first Spacelab mission dedicated to NASA's Mission to Planet Earth. It lifted off in the Discovery on March 24, 1992. During this nine-day mission, the crew operated the twelve experiments that constituted the Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science cargo. This was the first of several flights designed to study the composition of the mid-atmosphere and its variations over an eleven-year solar cycle, the regular period of energetic activity by the Sun. The mission also included the Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Instrument (SSBUV) to measure the ozone layer in concert with other measurements taken by satellites. The mission also carried the Oscar statuette for the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award that film maker George Lucas received on March 30, the presentation being made by the STS-45 crew from Earth orbit. Sullivan had special responsibility for a dose-response experiment that involved firing an electron pulse into the upper atmosphere and recording the luminosity induced with a special camera. Discovery landed at the Kennedy Space Center on April 2, 1992.Sullivan left NASA in 1993 having flown on three Space Shuttle missions and logged 532 hours in space.


== Military career ==
Sullivan became an adjunct professor of geology at Rice University in Houston in 1985. In this role she joined an oceanographic research cruise in 1988, where she met Andreas Rechnitzer, a US Navy oceanographer, and she started thinking about joining the US Naval Reserve (USNR) as an oceanography officer. She spoke to McCandless about it; he said he was having lunch with the Secretary of the Navy and would raise the matter. Later that year, Sullivan became a direct commission officer in the USNR with the rank of lieutenant commander.In October 1990 she assumed command of a small specialized unit of oceanographers and meteorologists. Based at Naval Air Station Dallas, it provided support to the Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command center on Guam. The unit was sent to Guam on January 13, 1991, four days before the start of Operation Desert Storm, and stayed for thirty days to augment the regular component responsible for the Western Pacific to free it to concentrate on the Persian Gulf. She retired from the USNR with the rank of captain in 2006.


== Civilian career ==


=== NOAA Chief Scientist ===
While she was still working on preparations for STS-45, Sullivan received a call from Sylvia Earle, the chief scientist of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In 1981 Earle and Sullivan had been part of the first group of women admitted to the Explorers Club. Earle was stepping down from the role at the NOAA, and asked Sullivan if she was interested in taking over. With the permission of her STS-45 mission commander, Charles Bolden, Sullivan flew to Washington, DC, where she was interviewed by the Administrator of the NOAA, John A. Knauss. Her nomination was forwarded to the US Senate for confirmation, and she arranged to be seconded from NASA to NOAA as acting chief scientist from August 17, 1992.Before she could be confirmed, President George H. W. Bush lost the 1992 United States presidential election and was succeeded by Bill Clinton, and the nomination was withdrawn. Sullivan still wanted the job, so she lobbied for it, enlisting the help of the outgoing Secretary of Commerce, Barbara Franklin, and senators Barbara Mikulski and Bill Nelson. The incoming Secretary of Commerce, Ronald H. Brown, forwarded her nomination to the Senate again in April, and she was confirmed on May 28, 1993. As chief scientist at NOAA, she oversaw a diverse portfolio which included ranging research into climate change, the use of satellites for oceanography, and marine biodiversity.


=== Career 1996 to 2011 ===
Sullivan was president and CEO of the COSI Columbus, an interactive science center in Columbus, Ohio, from 1996 to 2006. From 2006 to 2011 she was Director for Ohio State University's Battelle Center for Mathematics and Science Education Policy while remaining a volunteer science advisor to COSI. She was appointed as vice chair of the National Science Board by President George W. Bush in 2004. In 2009 Sullivan was elected to a three-year term as the chair of the Section on General Interest in Science and Engineering for the American Association for the Advancement of Science.


=== Assistant Secretary of Commerce ===
In January 2011 President Barack Obama sent the Senate his nomination of Sullivan to be an Assistant Secretary of Commerce. Sullivan was first nominated in December 2010, but because the Senate did not approve her nomination before the session ended, the White House renewed the nomination. On May 4, 2011, Sullivan was confirmed by unanimous consent of the Senate and appointed by President Obama to serve as Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Environmental Observation and Prediction and Deputy Administrator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Sullivan became Acting Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and Acting NOAA Administrator on February 28, 2013, following the resignation of Jane Lubchenco. President Obama nominated Sullivan to serve as the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and NOAA Administrator on August 1, 2013, and she was confirmed by the Senate on March 6, 2014. Her term ended on January 20, 2017.


=== Positions since 2017 ===
Sullivan was named the 2017 Charles A. Lindbergh Chair of Aerospace History, a competitive twelve-month fellowship at the National Air and Space Museum. During her residence in the museum, Sullivan's research focused on the Hubble Space Telescope. She has also served as a Senior Fellow at the Potomac Institute for Policy Studies. Her book Handprints on Hubble: An Astronaut's Story of Invention was released from MIT Press in November 2019. It recounted her experience as part of the team that launched, rescued, repaired, and maintained the Hubble Space Telescope.In June 2020 Sullivan traveled on an expedition aboard the Triton Submarines DSV Limiting Factor to the bottom of the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench, becoming the first woman and eighth person to reach the deepest known point in Earth's oceans, and the first person to travel both to Challenger Deep and into space. In November 2020 Sullivan was named a volunteer member of Joe Biden's presidential transition Agency Review Team to support transition efforts related to the Department of Commerce, and he appointed her to the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology in September 2021.


== Awards and recognition ==
Sullivan's awards from NASA included the NASA Space Flight Medal in 1984, 1990 and 1992; the NASA Exceptional Service Medal in 1988 and 1991, the NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal in 1992, and a Certificate of Appreciation in 1996. She received the Haley Space Flight Award in 1991, the Gold Medal of the Society of Woman Geographers in 1993, the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1994, and the Adler Planetarium Women in Space Science Award in 2004.

In 2014 Sullivan was named in the Time 100 list, an annual list of the world's most influential people. John Glenn wrote in her blurb: Kathy is not just an ivory-tower scientist. She was part of NASA's first class of female astronauts, selected in 1978, and went on to fly three shuttle missions. She is the first American woman to walk in space and served aboard the mission that deployed the Hubble Space Telescope. That role in helping humanity look outward has not prevented her from looking homeward. The planet is suffering increasingly severe upheavals, at least partly a result of climate change—droughts, floods, typhoons, tornadoes. I believe my good friend Kathy is the right person for the right job at the right time.
Sullivan received honorary Doctor of Science degrees from Willamette University in 2013 in conjunction with her presentation of a commencement address, and from Brown University in May 2015, for her ""abundant contributions to science, education and the public good, and her ongoing commitment to improving the state of our planet for future generations"". In September 2015 she presented the John H. Glenn Lecture in Space History Series at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. Titled ""Looking at Earth: An Astronaut's Journey"", Sullivan discussed her life of exploration and discovery, what it is like to fulfill her childhood dreams, and how NOAA's study of our planet helps us understand today's environmental challenges.Sullivan was inducted into the Astronaut Hall of Fame in 2004, elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2016, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2017. In 2020 the American Association of Geographers named her Honorary Geographer. She was on the list of the BBC's 100 Women announced on November 23, 2020. In September of 2023 Sullivan will be inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio.

3409 Abramov,"3409 Abramov, provisional designation 1977 RE6, is a stony Koronian asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt, approximately 11 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 9 September 1977, by Soviet–Russian astronomer Nikolai Chernykh at Crimean Astrophysical Observatory in Nauchnyj on the Crimean peninsula. The asteroid was named after Russian writer Fyodor Abramov.


== Orbit and classification ==
The S-type asteroid is a member of the Koronis family, a group consisting of about 200 known stony bodies with nearly ecliptical orbits. It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.6–3.1 AU once every 4 years and 10 months (1,761 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.08 and an inclination of 1° with respect to the ecliptic. The first precovery was obtained at Lowell Observatory in 1929, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 48 years prior to its discovery.


== Physical characteristics ==


=== Lightcurves ===
In 2008, a photometric lightcurve analysis at the Universidad de Monterry Observatory, Mexico, gave a well-defined rotation period of 7.791±0.002 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.50 in magnitude (U=3), while an observation by astronomer René Roy rendered a tentative period of 9.0±0.4 hours (U=2).


=== Diameter and albedo ===
According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of the NASA's space-based Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid has an albedo of 0.24 with a corresponding diameter of 10.8 kilometers. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link and others closely agree with these findings.


== Naming ==
This minor planet was named in memory of Russian novelist and literary critic Fyodor Abramov (1920–1983), whose work focused on the difficult lives of the Russian peasant class. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 1 September 1993 (M.P.C. 22498).

"Cornelius, Oregon","Cornelius is a city in Washington County, Oregon, United States. Located in the Portland metropolitan area, the city's population was 11,869  at the 2010 census. The city lies along Tualatin Valley Highway between Forest Grove to the west and Hillsboro to the east. Cornelius was incorporated in 1893 and is named for founder Thomas R. Cornelius.


== History ==
In 1845, Benjamin Cornelius immigrated to Oregon with his family, traveling with Joseph Meek.  The Cornelius family settled on the Tualatin Plains, near what is now North Plains.  The same year, Benjamin Q. Tucker and Solomon Emerick staked land claims and established farms on the land that would eventually become Cornelius.  At that time, the area was called Free Orchards; there was no actual community, but the name referred to the orchards on the 107 acres (0.43 km2) of land.
In 1871, Benjamin Cornelius's son Colonel Thomas R. Cornelius learned that Ben Holladay planned to extend the Oregon and California Railroad right through Free Orchards.  Holladay had been told by Forest Grove and Hillsboro that they would not allow the railroad free right-of-way, so Holladay planned to bypass them, and build Free Orchards into a new city that would become the new county seat of Washington County.

The new railroad was approaching Free Orchards in 1871, and Cornelius saw an opportunity to benefit from the new railroad.  He left his farm and built a new house, a warehouse, and a store in Free Orchards.  The warehouse and store were located right next to the railroad, and so became natural places for local farmers to trade and store their goods.  Cornelius also built a creamery to process milk, and two sawmills to supply lumber for the growing community.  In addition, he helped to build the first frame schoolhouse and the Methodist Church.
In 1893, Free Orchards was incorporated and renamed ""Cornelius"", to honor the man who spent many years helping build the community.  Though Holladay's plan to make Free Orchards into the county seat never materialized, Cornelius survives today as an agricultural town and, increasingly, as a suburb of Portland. The Cornelius Public Library was founded in 1912.

Joshua Zeitlin,"Joshua Zeitlin (1742 in Shklov, Belarus – August 18, 1822, in Kherson, Novorossiya) was a Russian rabbinical scholar and philanthropist. He was a pupil of the Talmudist Rabbi Aryeh Leib ben Asher Gunzberg, who was the author of Sha'agat Aryeh. Being an expert in political economics, he maintained close relations with Prince Potemkin, the favorite of Catherine the Great. During the Turko-Russian war, Zeitlin furnished the Russian army with various supplies, and managed that business so well that afterwards, he was appointed as imperial court councillor.
After retiring from business in the civil rank of court councillor, Zeitlin resided on his estate, Ustzia, where he was occasionally consulted by rabbis. He rendered financial assistance to many Talmudists and scholars, and supported a local beit midrash, in which many Jewish scholars were provided for, so that they could pursue their studies full-time. Some of the scholars who benefited from his generosity were: Rabbi Nahum, author of Tosafot Bikkurim; Mendel Lepin, author of Cheshbon ha-Nefesh; and the physician Baruch Schick. Zeitlin was the author of annotations to the Sefer Mitzwot Katan, that were printed with the text (Kopys, 1820), and supplemented by some of his responsa.

Randy Phillips (politician),"Randell Ernest ""Randy"" Phillips (born August 30, 1950) is a retired politician from the U.S. state of Alaska.  Phillips served for twenty-six years as a Republican member of the Alaska House of Representatives and the Alaska Senate, from 1977 to 2003.
Phillips was born in Seattle, Washington, on August 30, 1950.  He came to Alaska with his family in 1956.  He received a B.A. from Alaska Methodist University in 1973.  He established residency in Eagle River, along the Glenn Highway north of Anchorage. He worked as a legislative aide in the 9th Alaska State Legislature before running for the House himself in 1976.  He was elected to the four-member 8th District, which stretched from the Anchorage neighborhoods Mountain View and Muldoon, out the Glenn Highway to Eagle River, Chugiak and Eklutna.
In his first term in the 10th Alaska State Legislature, Phillips was named Outstanding Freshman Legislator. In his second term, he was the second-youngest member of the House by only one day, being born the day after Ray Metcalfe. He served in the House until 1993; following redistricting during the 1980s, he represented the two-member 15th District, which pared his constituency down to the Chugiak and Eagle River areas.
His tenure in the Alaska Senate lasted from 1993 to 2003. He said his decision to retire from the legislature was prompted by redistricting that drastically altered his district. The redistricting in question placed Phillips in District P, which reached from the eastern and southern portions of Eagle River to northeast and south Anchorage, Whittier and the northeastern Kenai Peninsula, mostly connecting through Chugach State Park. Phillips would have had to run against south Anchorage representative Con Bunde (who did win the seat and served until his retirement in 2011) in a district largely removed from his traditional constituency.From 1987 to 1991, Phillips was tied with fellow 15th District representative Sam Cotten as the senior member of the House.  Cotten was elected to the Senate in 1990, which left Phillips as the senior member in his final term. Following the 1994 reelection defeat of Jalmar M. Kerttula, Phillips was tied with Tim Kelly from 1995 to 2001 as the senior member of the legislature. Kelly was also first elected to the House from the 8th District in 1976. Kelly's retirement left Phillips as the senior member of the legislature in his final two years in office. In the overall history of the Alaska Legislature, Phillips is the third-longest-serving member; if the territorial legislature is excluded, Phillips is second behind Kerttula. At the conclusion of the 27th Alaska State Legislature, his length of service will be tied by both Johnny Ellis and Lyman Hoffman; the former was the same age as Phillips when he was first elected to the legislature.
His papers are held at the Consortium Library of the University of Alaska Anchorage and Alaska Pacific University, the latter the lineal descendant of his alma mater AMU.

Dylan Thomas Centre,"The Dylan Thomas Centre is an arts centre located in the Maritime Quarter in Swansea, Wales. It is a Grade II* listed building.


== History ==
The building was commissioned to replace a previous guildhall which had been located near Swansea Castle and dated back to the late 16th century. The new building, which was designed by John Collingwood in the neo-classical style and built by Thomas Bowen, was completed in 1829.  It was remodelled to the plans of Thomas Taylor in 1852, using a design which was modelled on the Temple of Jupiter Stator in Rome. The external design involved nine bays on each side with round-arched windows on the ground floor and tall round-arched windows flanked by Corinthian order columns on the first floor.It was converted for use as a juvenile employment centre after the civic leaders moved to the new Swansea Guildhall in 1934. During the Second World War it was requisitioned by the army for use as a recruiting centre. After reverting to use as a juvenile employment centre, it became a College of Further Education in 1960 and then became an annexe to Dynevor School in 1970 before closing in 1982.The building was officially re-opened by the American former President Jimmy Carter and the last Leader of the Swansea City Council, Trevor Burtonshaw, as the Dylan Thomas Centre in 1995. In 2012 a large part of the Centre was leased by Swansea's council to the University of Wales with the purpose of using it as a business centre for creative industries.In October 2014, the Centre launched the permanent ""Love the Words"" exhibition which explores Dylan's life and work through a variety of media and including letters, books, worksheets and photographs. It was made possible with support of nearly £1 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund.The Dylan Thomas Centre is home to a year-round programme of literary events, including book launches, plays, poetry evenings, changing exhibitions and science talks. It also hosts the annual Dylan Thomas Festival held between Dylan’s birth and death dates, 27 October to 9 November.

In 2004, she was said to have merged the arts of painting and photography to create a ""highly evocative"" body of work that concentrated on ice-frozen areas of the Bow River in Alberta. In 2016, in a group exhibition at Toronto's InterAccess Gallery, titled Once Is Nothing: A Drone Art Exhibition, she let a quadcopter fly at ankle height to record the leaves in Scarborough's Rouge Park for a video, Passing. In her solo exhibition trace at the McClure Gallery in Montreal in 2020, she used a drone to make drawings of the land below, marked them with different media, then printed selected images on fabric and used them in lightboxes which enveloped the viewer so that he or she could experience the place for themselves.


== Exhibitions ==
Millard began showing her work as an artist in group exhibitions in 1987 in Calgary. Since then, she has participated in many group exhibitions both nationally and internationally. In 2017, her work was included in Every. Now. Then: reframing nationhood at the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto.

Adelaide Johnson,"Adelaide Johnson (1859–1955) was an American sculptor whose work is displayed in the U.S. Capitol and a feminist who was devoted to the cause of equality of women. She was known as the ""sculptor of the women's movement"".


== Biography ==
Born Sarah Adeline Johnson to a farm family of modest means in Plymouth, Illinois, she attended rural school and then took classes at the St. Louis School of Design. In 1878, she changed from Sarah Adeline to Adelaide, a name she thought was more dramatic. She moved to Chicago and supported herself with her art. In January 1882, hurrying to get to her studio, she slipped and fell twenty feet down the well of an unguarded elevator shaft. Badly hurt, she sued for compensation and was awarded the sum of $15,000. This injury and award gave her the financial freedom to travel to Europe to study painting and sculpture, an opportunity she would never have had without the accident. She took the opportunity to study in Dresden and Rome, studying with Giulio Monteverde in Rome where she kept a studio until 1920.

Johnson exhibited her work, The Portrait Monument and a bust of Caroline B. Winslow at The Woman's Building at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. The high point of her professional career was to complete a monument in Washington D.C. in honor of the women's suffrage movement. Alva Belmont helped to secure funding for the piece, Portrait Monument to Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Susan B. Anthony, which was unveiled in 1921. This piece was originally kept on display in the crypt of the US Capitol, but was moved to its current location and more prominently displayed in the rotunda in 1997.In 1896 she married Frederick Jenkins, a British businessman and fellow vegetarian who was eleven years younger than she. He took her family name of Johnson as ""the tribute love pays to genius."" They were wed by a woman minister, and her bridesmaids were the busts she had sculpted of Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. The marriage ended after twelve years.Her career declined after the 1930s, and financial problems beset her. She relied on others for financial support and was often unwilling to sell her sculptures because she felt the prices offered did not recognize her work. Faced with eviction for failure to pay taxes, in 1939 she invited the press to witness her mutilating her own sculptures as a protest against her circumstances, and against the failure to realize her dream of a studio-museum commemorating suffragists and other women's campaigners. She moved in with friends in 1947 and appeared on TV quiz programs trying to win money to buy back her home. Her flamboyant nature led her to lie about her age through her life. She celebrated her 100th birthday at the age of 88, realizing that it made good publicity. Upon her death, her age was reported to be 108, though she was ""only"" 96. She is buried in Washington, D.C. at Congressional Cemetery.


== Personal life ==
Johnson became a vegetarian in her youth. She was vegetarian because she believed it was morally wrong to take the life of any living creature. In 1893, Johnson was a speaker at the third International Vegetarian Congress in Chicago.Johnson did not embrace a particular religion but took interest in Christian Science, spiritualism and theosophy. She was a member of the National Spiritualist Association of Churches. Her niece, Alathena Johnson Smith, became a noted child psychologist.

Samuel Shaftoe,"Samuel Shaftoe (25 May 1841 – 27 November 1911) was a British trade unionist.
Born in York, Shaftoe moved with his family to Kingston upon Hull when he was eleven, leaving school and becoming an apprentice basket maker.  He joined the Basket Makers' trade union in 1862, and took part in a strike two years later, but lost his job as a result, and moved to Bradford to find work.  There, he played a prominent part in a six-month long strike, and was then elected as the local secretary of the Yorkshire Skep and Basket Makers' Union.Shaftoe immediately began campaigning for the union to expand its remit and provide benefits for members who were unable to work due to illness, and for families of deceased members.  This was agreed, and in 1868 he was appointed as the union's general secretary.  He led two strikes, both successful, resulting in increases in wages and a maximum nine-hour day.In 1872, Bradford Trades Council was refounded, and Shaftoe was elected as its first president.  He was seriously injured in 1875, and took two years out of union activism, but returned, then in 1882, instead became secretary of the trades council.  He also regularly attended the Trades Union Congress (TUC), and was elected as President of the TUC when it met in Bradford in 1888.  From 1891 until 1894, Shaftoe served on Bradford Town Council as a Liberal-Labour member, backed by the Bradford Labour Union.  During this time, he was also prominent in the Labour Electoral Association, and these roles brought him into conflict with the Bradford Labour Union, who wanted labour candidates to be entirely independent of the Liberal Party.  In 1893, he was defeated for his trades council post by a member of the new Independent Labour Party.  Despite bad feelings, Shaftoe remained involved with the labour movement in Bradford, and also became the first working man in the West Riding of Yorkshire to become a magistrate.By 1905, Shaftoe was suffering poor health and struggling for an income.  The trades council persuaded the town council to pay him a small pension until his death in 1911.

Turbomolecular pump,"A turbomolecular pump is a type of vacuum pump, superficially similar to a turbopump, used to obtain and maintain high vacuum. These pumps work on the principle that gas molecules can be given momentum in a desired direction by repeated collision with a moving solid surface. In a turbomolecular pump, a rapidly spinning fan rotor 'hits' gas molecules from the inlet of the pump towards the exhaust in order to create or maintain a vacuum.

Most turbomolecular pumps employ multiple stages, each consisting of a quickly rotating rotor blade and stationary stator blade pair. The system is an axial compressor that puts energy into the gas, rather than a turbine, which takes energy out of a moving fluid to create rotary power, thus ""turbomolecular pump"" is a misnomer. Gas captured by the upper stages is pushed into the lower stages and successively compressed to the level of the fore-vacuum (backing pump) pressure.
As the gas molecules enter through the inlet, the rotor, which has a number of angled blades, hits the molecules. Thus the mechanical energy of the blades is transferred to the gas molecules. With this newly acquired momentum, the gas molecules enter into the gas transfer holes in the stator. This leads them to the next stage where they again collide with the rotor surface, and this process is continued, finally leading them outwards through the exhaust.
Because of the relative motion of rotor and stator, molecules preferentially hit the lower side of the blades. Because the blade surface looks down, most of the scattered molecules will leave it downwards. The surface is rough, so no reflection will occur. A blade needs to be thick and stable enough for high pressure operation and as thin as possible and slightly bent for maximum compression. For high compression ratios the throat between adjacent rotor blades (as shown in the image) is pointing as much as possible in the forward direction. For high flow rates the blades are at 45° and reach close to the axis.

Because the compression of each stage is ≈10, each stage closer to the outlet is considerably smaller than the preceding inlet stages. This has two consequences. The geometric progression tells us that infinite stages could ideally fit into a finite axial length. The finite length in this case is the full height of the housing as the bearings, the motor, and controller and some of the coolers can be installed inside on the axis. Radially, to grasp as much of the thin gas at the entrance, the inlet-side rotors would ideally have a larger radius, and correspondingly higher centrifugal force; ideal blades would get exponentially thinner towards their tips and carbon fibers should reinforce the aluminium blades. However, because the average speed of a blade affects pumping so much this is done by increasing the root diameter rather than the tip diameter where practical.
The performance of a turbomolecular pump is strongly related to the frequency of the rotor. As rpm increases, the rotor blades deflect more. To increase speed and reduce the deformation, stiffer materials and different blade designs have been suggested.Turbomolecular pumps must operate at very high speeds, and the friction heat buildup imposes design limitations. Some turbomolecular pumps use magnetic bearings to reduce friction and oil contamination. Because the magnetic bearings and the temperature cycles allow for only a limited clearance between rotor and stator, the blades at the high pressure stages are somewhat degenerated into a single helical foil each. Laminar flow cannot be used for pumping, because laminar turbines stall when not used at the designed flow. The pump can be cooled down to improve the compression, but should not be so cold as to condense ice on the blades.
When a turbopump is stopped, the oil from the backing vacuum may backstream through the turbopump and contaminate the chamber. One way to prevent this is to introduce a laminar flow of nitrogen through the pump. The transition from vacuum to nitrogen and from a running to a still turbopump has to be synchronized precisely to avoid mechanical stress to the pump and overpressure at the exhaust. A thin membrane and a valve at the exhaust should be added to protect the turbopump from excessive back pressure (e.g. after a power failure or leaks in the backing vacuum).
The rotor is stabilized in all of its six degrees of freedom. One degree is governed by the electric motor. Minimally, this degree must be stabilized electronically (or by a diamagnetic material, which is too unstable to be used in a precision pump bearing). Another way (ignoring losses in magnetic cores at high frequencies) is to construct this bearing as an axis with a sphere at each end. These spheres are inside hollow static spheres. On the surface of each sphere is a checkerboard pattern of inwards and outwards going magnetic field lines. As the checkerboard pattern of the static spheres is rotated, the rotor rotates. In this construction no axis is made stable on the cost of making another axis unstable, but all axes are neutral and the electronic regulation is less stressed and will be more dynamically stable. Hall effect sensors can be used to sense the rotational position and the other degrees of freedom can be measured capacitively.


== Maximum pressure ==
At atmospheric pressure, the mean free path of air is about 70 nm. A turbomolecular pump can work only if those molecules hit by the moving blades reach the stationary blades before colliding with other molecules on their way. To achieve that, the gap between moving blades and stationary blades must be close to or less than the mean free path. From a practical construction standpoint, a feasible gap between the blade sets is on the order of 1 mm, so a turbopump will stall (no net pumping) if exhausted directly to the atmosphere. Since the mean free path is inversely proportional to pressure, a turbopump will pump when the exhaust pressure is less than about 10 Pa (0.10 mbar) where the mean free path is about 0.7 mm.
Most turbopumps have a Holweck pump (or molecular drag pump) as their last stage to increase the maximum backing pressure (exhaust pressure) to about 1–10 mbar. Theoretically, a centrifugal pump, a side channel pump, or a regenerative pump could be used to back to atmospheric pressure directly, but currently there is no commercially available turbopump that exhausts directly to atmosphere. In most cases, the exhaust is connected to a mechanical backing pump (usually called roughing pump) that produces a pressure low enough for the turbomolecular pump to work efficiently. Typically, this backing pressure is below 0.1 mbar and commonly about 0.01 mbar. The backing pressure is rarely below 10−3 mbar (mean free path ≈ 70 mm) because the flow resistance of the vacuum pipe between the turbopump and the roughing pump becomes significant.
The turbomolecular pump can be a very versatile pump. It can generate many degrees of vacuum from intermediate vacuum (≈10−2 Pa) up to ultra-high vacuum levels (≈10−8 Pa).
Multiple turbomolecular pumps in a lab or manufacturing-plant can be connected by tubes to a small backing pump. Automatic valves and diffusion pump like injection into a large buffer-tube in front of the backing pump prevents any overpressure from one pump to stall another pump.


== Practical considerations ==
Laws of fluid dynamics do not provide good approximations for the behavior of individual, highly separated, non-interacting gas molecules, like those found in high vacuum environments. The maximum compression varies linearly with circumferential rotor speed.  In order to obtain extremely low pressures down to 1 micropascal, rotation rates of 20,000 to 90,000 revolutions per minute are often necessary. Unfortunately, the compression ratio varies exponentially with the square root of the molecular weight of the gas.  Thus, heavy molecules are pumped much more efficiently than light molecules.  Most gases are heavy enough to be well pumped but it is difficult to pump hydrogen and helium efficiently.
An additional drawback stems from the high rotor speed of this type of pump: very high grade bearings are required, which increase the cost.

Because turbomolecular pumps only work in molecular flow conditions, a pure turbomolecular pump will require a very large backing pump to work effectively. Thus, many modern pumps have a molecular drag stage such as a Holweck or Gaede mechanism near the exhaust to reduce the size of backing pump required.
Much of recent turbo pump development has been focused on improvement of the effectiveness of the drag stages.   As gas is removed from a pumped space, the lighter gases hydrogen and helium become a larger proportion of the remaining gas load.  In recent years it has been demonstrated that the precise design of the surface geometry of the drag stages can have a marked effect on pumping of these light gases, improving compression ratios by up to two orders of magnitude for given pumping volume.   As a result, it is possible to use much smaller backing pumps than would be required by pure turbomolecular pumps and/or design more compact turbomolecular pumps.


== History ==

The turbomolecular pump was invented in 1958 by W. Becker, based on the older molecular drag pumps developed by Wolfgang Gaede in 1913, Fernand Holweck in 1923 and Manne Siegbahn in 1944.

Some practical guidelines","A turbomolecular pump is a type of vacuum pump, superficially similar to a turbopump, used to obtain and maintain high vacuum. These pumps work on the principle that gas molecules can be given momentum in a desired direction by repeated collision with a moving solid surface. In a turbomolecular pump, a rapidly spinning fan rotor 'hits' gas molecules from the inlet of the pump towards the exhaust in order to create or maintain a vacuum.

Chemical Probes Portal,"The Chemical Probes Portal is an open, online resource whose purpose is to identify and make available high quality chemical probes for use in biological research and drug discovery.  While chemical probes can be valuable tools to elucidate signal transduction pathways and to validate new drug targets, many of the probes that are in use are not selective and therefore can give very misleading results.The Portal recommends chemical probes based on ratings provided by its Scientific Advisory Board (SAB), a group of experts in the fields of chemical biology, medicinal chemistry, and pharmacology, who (1) determine which are the best chemical probes available and (2) establish guidelines for using them.


== History ==
After years of publishing best practice guidelines for the selection and use of chemical probes, many in the field agreed that publications were insufficient to disseminate this type of information. In July 2015, these experts, led by the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC), collaborated to publish an overview of the misuse of chemical probes and the impact that misuse has on the reliability of research. A prototype website was launched by the SGC in conjunction with the publication.
This publication and the portal were launched at the same time the biomedical research community was becoming aware of problems in the reproducibility of much of the scientific literature. According to an economic impact study, $28 billion per year is spent on irreproducible biomedical research in the US alone. The most common reasons that studies prove irreproducible include problems with the selection of reagents and reference materials (36%), study design (28%), data analysis and reporting (25%), and laboratory protocols (11%). Errors in the selection and application of chemical probes can contribute to waste in each of these categories. Given the context and the need, the prototype portal was largely well received by the scientific community, although it was noted that the prototype portal was launched with a very small number (seven to be exact) of probes.In 2016, the SGC recruited staff to take over the portal, establish it as an independent organization, and build it into a reputable source for information about chemical probes. This new organization was supported with funds provided by the Wellcome Trust and the SGC. By the end of the first quarter, the portal’s new leadership incorporated the organization in North Carolina, US, established a board of directors and developed a plan to grow the portal through a community-driven, expert-curation process. The portal was re-launched on June 30, 2016 with this operations plan integrated into the site, more data about the existing probes (~100) in the portal, recommendations for the use of those probes.
The Portal works closely with Target 2035, a global effort to provide high quality chemical or biological probes for every protein in the human proteome by 2035.


== Board of directors ==
In June 2016, the Portal announced its founding Board of Directors including Mark Bunnage (Vertex), Aled Edwards (SGC), Yung Lie (Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation), Herbert Waldmann (Max Planck Institute of Molecular Physiology), Tim Willson (SGC UNC), and Paul Workman (ICR).


== Scientific advisory board ==
The SAB, an international collection of experts from the fields of medicinal chemistry, pharmacology, and chemical biology, was created to provide the Portal with expert advice. The SAB considers submitted chemical probes and makes recommendations for their use. In addition to considering chemical probes, SAB members also provide strategic and scientific advice to portal staff to help ensure the portal stays in tune with the scientific community and its needs. The Portal issued an open call for new SAB members to join the effort in May 2016, which will remain open until the SAB reaches its target membership.


== Procedures ==
The Portal opted for an expert peer-review process to vet and rate chemical probes. Key to this process is the Portal’s SAB, who represent a global community and multiple professional environments (e.g., pharma, biotech, clinical centers or academia). These experts bring diverse experiences and expertise to the Portal to help it provide balanced advice to scientists who want to use chemical probes in their experiments without becoming chemical probe experts themselves.
The Portal’s review process involves three main steps: 1) probe submission, 2) triage, 3) review and publication. In the first step, scientists who have generated and published chemical probes can submit their probes for consideration. Initially, the portal can only accept submissions for probes that have been published.
Portal staff consider completed probe submissions to determine whether they are eligible for review. Submissions must meet three criteria to merit consideration by the SAB: 1) the probe is published, 2) it has been deposited into a public database such as PubChem (the Portal can now deposit submitted probes to PubChem on behalf of its users), and 3) there are data supporting its validation in a cellular and/or in vivo model system. Probes that do not meet these criteria are not sent to the SAB for review but are retained in the database. Probes that meet all three criteria are reviewed.
SAB members review each probe submission, including the publication reporting the probe, and rate the probe for its use in cellular and/or in vivo model systems (e.g., mice). Probes are evaluated for use in these two types of systems independently, meaning that it is not necessary for a probe to be validated for use in model organisms for it to be considered and endorsed by the portal. The portal has not strictly defined criteria that translate into Portal endorsement. Rather, the Portal relies on its experts, their experience with and knowledge of specific protein targets to assess the quality of a probe. SAB members can comment on each probe, providing guidance to users to ensure they understand the strengths and weaknesses of a probe before they use it.
Probes are published on the Portal along with a highlight of the probe’s validation data, and it takes a few weeks for the SAB ratings (denoted with 0 to 4 stars) to emerge. Probe pages also contain SAB comments and links to related databases or sources (e.g., journals) where additional information can be found. Probes must receive an average of 3 stars to earn an endorsement from the Portal.

Battle of Bereza Kartuska,"The Battle of Bereza Kartuska was fought between the Second Polish Republic and Soviet Russia around the village Bereza Kartuska (now Byaroza, Belarus) first on 14 February 1919, and again between 21 and 26 July 1920. 
The first skirmish of Bereza is considered to be the initial engagement of the Polish–Soviet War of 1919–1921 by some historians.


== History ==
After German and Polish representatives signed an evacuation agreement on 5 February 1919, the ten battalions of the newly formed Polish Army were to pass through German Oberkommando-Ostfront (Ober-Ost) lines at Wolkowysk to reach the Bolshevik front, where on 12 January 1919, the Soviet Supreme Command ordered a ""reconnaissance in depth"", codenamed Target Vistula.
It is problematical whether this [Soviet] operation, which bore the code name 'Target Vistula' was intended to bring the Red Army as conquering heroes into Warsaw. Its name suggest so. Yet the extremely tentative phrasing of its directives and the extremely parlous state of the Western Army suggests otherwise.
In February 1919, both Soviet Russia and newly-reborn Poland were in their infancy, and both only months old.: 31  On 13 February 1919, at 7 in the morning, 57 Polish soldiers and 5 officers, led by Capt. Mienicki of the Polish Wilno Detachment, made a sortie into the township of Biaroza (Polish: Bereza), a small city to the east of Brzesc capturing 80 soldiers of the Red Army.: 26–27 


=== The second Battle of Bereza Kartuska ===
One year later, between 21 and 26 July 1920, soldiers of the Polish 14th Infantry Division under General Daniel Konarzewski once again clashed with the Red Army in Bereza Kartuska, soon after the Battle of Warsaw (1920). Poles had retreated from Baranowicze, abandoning German Imperial Army fortifications constructed there during World War I, and took defensive positions along the Jasiołda River. After three days of heavy fighting, the 14th I.D. once again was forced to retreat towards Kobryn, after burning the bridges on the Jasiołda. The town of Bereza Kartuska was retaken by the Polish Army and, at the end of the Polish–Soviet War, ceded to Poland in the Peace of Riga signed by Soviet Russia (acting also on behalf of Soviet Belarus). The peace treaty remained in force until the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939.

Ireland West Airport,"Ireland West Airport (IATA: NOC, ICAO: EIKN) (Irish: Aerfort Iarthar Éireann Mhuire), officially known as Ireland West Airport Knock (Irish: Aerfort Iarthar Éireann Chnoc Mhuire), commonly known as Knock Airport, is an international airport 5.6 km (3.48 mi) south-west of Charlestown, County Mayo, Ireland.  The village of Knock is 20 km (12.43 mi) away. 750,000 passengers used the airport in 2017, making it the fourth-busiest in Ireland (after Dublin, Cork and Shannon).


== History ==
The airport opened on 25 October 1985 with three Aer Lingus charter flights to Rome: the official opening was on 30 May 1986. The site, on a hill in boggy terrain, was thought by many to be unrealistic, but the airport was built following a long and controversial campaign by Monsignor James Horan, the story of which has even inspired a musical. The primary motivation for building it was to attract pilgrims to Knock Shrine. Despite criticisms that the site was too boggy and too foggy, Horan delivered an airport within five years, primarily financed by a Government grant of £9.8 million. He died shortly after the opening of the airport, and his funeral was held at the then-named Horan International Airport. In recent times, Horan has been celebrated with a bronze statue erected at the airport.By 1988, over 100,000 passengers had passed through. Aer Lingus commenced flights from the airport to Birmingham in 1995.


== Recent years ==
Since 2003, flag-carrier, low-cost and regional airlines including Aer Lingus, MyTravelLite, Bmibaby, Ryanair, Aer Arann, flybe, Lufthansa and EasyJet have added routes to Great Britain and mainland Europe. Not all have proven successful, but by 2005 the airport was handling 500,000 passengers per annum.It was voted Ireland's best regional airport in 2006 and 2009 by the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland.2007 was a notable year, with scheduled transatlantic services to New York and Boston commencing in May, operated by the now-defunct Flyglobespan.A record 629,000 passengers used the airport in 2008, a 13% rise compared to the previous year.The installation of the Category II Instrument Landing System in April 2009 has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of flight diversions to other airports due to poor visibility – the airport is 200 metres above sea level. August 2009 was the busiest month for three years, with 81,000 passengers: 28 August was the busiest day in the airport's history, with over 4,500 passengers.
In 2011, the month of August was the busiest in the airport's history with 84,052 passengers. 2011 was the most successful year to date with 654,553 passengers. The year saw the commencement of routes to Lanzarote, Tenerife and Gran Canaria operated by Ryanair and to Edinburgh operated by flybe. During September 2011 Ryanair celebrated its four-millionth passenger through the airport, while Lufthansa announced it would be commencing weekly flights to Düsseldorf in May 2012. In November 2011, Ryanair announced flights to Beauvais-Tillé, Frankfurt-Hahn, Bergamo-Orio al Serio and Girona-Costa Brava from March 2012. In January 2012 the 20th scheduled route was announced—flybe to Leeds, its third from the airport, from March 2012. Budget carrier BmiBaby announced in May 2012 that it was to axe its only route to Birmingham from 10 June, owing to the airline's takeover by IAG. Flights to Beauvais-Tillé and Frankfurt-Hahn have since ended.
In 2013, Ryanair launched a weekly summer route to Málaga on Thursdays. Aer Lingus Regional, which took over the Birmingham route operating a daily service using ATR 72s ended service on 26 October. Flybe began four-times-weekly flights on the route on 27 October. On 31 October 2013, in response to the scrapping of the Irish travel tax, Ryanair unveiled three new routes from Knock to Glasgow-Prestwick, Kaunas and Eindhoven. However, these routes had all been withdrawn by the fourth quarter of 2014.It was announced in November 2017 that €15 million would be invested in improving and upgrading the airport in 2018 and 2019, to coincide with strong passenger growth. These plans include upgrading of car parks, passenger facilities, the terminal and resurfacing of the runway.


== Government assistance ==
The building of the airport was primarily financed by Government grants totaling £9.858 million. The completion of the airport was funded by a £1.3 million grant from the European Union, payable on condition that the airport developers provided an equal sum from their own resources.On 21 February 2007, the Government of Ireland announced that it was making a €27 million capital grant. The airport stated that it would continue the implementation of its €46 million infrastructural investment programme with over €20 million of spend anticipated for 2008. Work commenced on a number of significant civil and building projects in this year. A€5.5 million extension to the terminal building was completed in April 2009. The implementation of Category II Instrument Landing System (CAT II ILS) on runway 27, to enhance reliability in low visibility, has been completed and approved. An extension to the Runway End Safety Areas (RESAs) and runway turnpad was completed in March 2009.Departing passengers aged 12 years and over pay a ""Development Fee"" of €10. The fee is a critical contributor to the ongoing sustainability of the airport and provides a vital funding source to support the ongoing development works of the airport.In 2005, the airport changed its name to Ireland West Airport Knock. As of August 2009, the Aeronautical Information Publication, including the aeronautical charts available at European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation, showed it as Ireland West.


== Company structure ==
The airport is owned and operated by Connaught Airport Development Company Ltd - a private company 82.5% owned by The Horan Airport Trust.  The remaining 17.5% is owned by seven local authorities - Donegal County Council, Galway County Council, Galway City Council, Leitrim County Council, Mayo County Council, Roscommon County Council and Sligo County Council.

Gatlinburg Bypass,"The Gatlinburg Bypass (also known as Parkway Bypass or U.S. Route 441 Bypass) is a 3.6-mile-long (5.8 km) bypass road around the resort city of Gatlinburg in Sevier County, Tennessee, at the edge of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. It runs between the Great Smoky Mountains Parkway (U.S. Route 321/U.S. Route 441, US 321/US 441) north of the city to Newfound Gap Road (US 441), the main route through the national park. It is owned and maintained by the National Park Service (NPS) and serves as a bypass around the business district of Gatlinburg for easier access to the national park. It is also considered part of the longer Foothills Parkway, a National Parkway that traverses the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains. The road provides overlooks with views of the city of Gatlinburg and the mountains beyond. The Gatlinburg Bypass opened to traffic in 1968. 


== Route description ==
The Gatlinburg Bypass is a two-lane road maintained by the NPS, although most of the route is located outside of the main boundaries of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Its main purpose is to allow tourists to bypass the congested business district of Gatlinburg in order to speed access to and from the national park. Trucks and other commercial vehicles are restricted from using the bypass, along with all other roads inside the national park. In 2022, the bypass carried an annual average daily traffic volume of 7,465 vehicles.The Gatlinburg Bypass begins at an intersection with US 441 (Newfound Gap Road) within the Great Smoky Mountains National Park southwest of Gatlinburg. This intersection is at-grade, but includes a loop ramp and an overpass bridge. It immediately crosses over the West Prong of the Little Pigeon River, and begins a steep ascent as it traverses Cove Mountain. Two overlooks along this section provide views of Gatlinburg below and Mount LeConte in the distance beyond. It crosses over Ski Mountain Road, the main access to Ober Gatlinburg, on a high viaduct before winding over to its only mid-route intersection at Campbell Lead Road. This road crosses over the bypass, and is accessed via a short two-way access road. After the intersection, the parkway begins a long, gradual descent down the mountain and curves from a westward to an eastward alignment in a hairpin turn. Following Cliff Branch for a short distance, the bypass next turns north and again crosses the West Prong of the Little Pigeon River, before ending at a partial directional T interchange with the Great Smoky Mountains Parkway (commonly known simply as ""Parkway""), which is designated as US 321/US 441. Here, the Foothills Parkway transitions from the bypass onto the Great Smoky Mountains Parkway to the north, which is known here as the Gatlinburg Spur. The bypass is only accessible from the southbound lanes of the parkway at this interchange.


== History ==
The need for a bypass around Gatlinburg was reportedly first raised when the Great Smoky Mountains National Park was established in 1934. Preliminary planning for the bypass began in the mid-1950s as tourism to the national park surged during the post-World War II boom. A number of tourist attractions were established in Gatlinburg during this time, and the parkway through the city began to suffer from severe congestion. At the time, the Great Smoky Mountains Parkway was in the process of being widened to four lanes between Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge, and a number of other road improvements were underway in the area to improve access to the park.A preliminary agreement was reached in March 1959 between the Tennessee Department of Highways, the predecessor to the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT), and the NPS over the design and maintenance of the road. Under this agreement, the state would purchase the right of way outside of the park, and the NPS would construct the bypass. Finalization of the agreement was stalled, however, as the NPS would not agree to an access road connection for properties along the bypass that had been requested by the highway department. By September 1960, it was reported that the state was dropping the request for the access road, but made another request two months later, which resulted in a further delay of the project by the NPS. This prompted the state to consider constructing the bypass without assistance from the park service. After further objections, the NPS agreed to provide an access point at Campbell Lead Road in April 1962 if the state would agree to a permanent prohibition of commercial vehicles on the bypass, along with a permanent restriction on US 441 through the national park once Interstate 40 was completed east of the park. This agreement was finalized by the NPS and the Great Smoky Mountains Conservation Association in June 1962.On January 4, 1963, the final agreement on the Gatlinburg Bypass between the state and the NPS was signed by then-Governor Buford Ellington. Work on the northern section of the bypass from near Campbell Lead Road to the northern river crossing began on July 14, 1964, and was completed on October 22, 1965. The contract for the section extending to the south river crossing was awarded on May 7, 1965, and construction began two months later. This section was completed on July 19, 1967. Work on the Campbell Lead Road overpass and bridge over Ski Mountain Road (then Wiley Oakley Drive) was begun in May 1966 and completed on September 5, 1967. Work on the interchange at the southern terminus of the bypass began in September 1966, and construction of the bridge over the Little Pigeon River at the opposite end began the following month. Both projects were completed in April 1968. The Gatlinburg Bypass was dedicated and opened to traffic on June 15, 1968, by Governor Ellington.Originally, traffic traveling northbound on the Great Smoky Mountains Parkway was reduced from two to one lane at the northern terminus of the Gatlinburg Bypass, creating a traffic bottleneck; the northbound bypass ramp then merged to become a second lane once again. In August 1993, work began on a project to remove this chokepoint, which consisted of widening the northbound parkway to two continuous lanes through the interchange, and constructing a merge lane for traffic transitioning from the bypass to the northbound parkway. Initially slated for completion on March 31, 1994, the project was repeatedly delayed by geological issues, weather conditions, and equipment problems. Construction was suspended two months later to make way for summer traffic, and resumed in November, with completion slated by the end of the year. One of the 2016 Great Smoky Mountains wildfires reached the bypass, resulting in a temporary closure of the route.

View of Venice,"View of Venice, also known as the de' Barbari Map, is a monumental woodcut print showing a bird's-eye view of the city of Venice from the southwest.  It bears the title and date ""VENETIE MD"" (""Venice 1500"").  It was printed from six wooden blocks designed from 1498 to 1500 by Jacopo de' Barbari, and then published in late 1500 by the Nuremberg publisher Anton Kolb on six large sheets of paper, each measuring about 66 cm × 99 cm (26 in × 39 in), to create a composite image measuring approximately 135 cm × 280 cm (53 in × 110 in). The individual sheets of paper were the largest produced in Europe up to that time.The finished work has an approximate scale of 1:1,250 (east-west) and 1:2,750 (north-south) and was probably intended for display on a wall. Examples of the three states of the print are held by public collections.  The six large wooden printing blocks would have been carved by professional cutters, following preparatory drawings made by Jacopo de' Barbari.  The six original blocks, probably made from walnut, now with splits and damage from woodworm, are in the Museo Correr in Venice.  

The print is one of the first large bird's-eye cityscape views, and may have been inspired by views of Florence by Francesco Rosselli from the 1480s.  It may be the earliest surviving comprehensive view of Venice: earlier views by Leon Battista Alberti and Jacopo Bellini are believed to be lost. The British Library quotes an article by art historian Martin Kemp in 1991 in which he says it is ""an achievement of astonishing visual and intellectual control"".


== Description ==
The print shows Venice and the surrounding islands in the Venetian lagoon, including Burano, Giudecca, Mazzorbo, Murano, and Torcello. The Alps to the north line the horizon along the top edge. The names of some locations and buildings are printed. The print shows the location of Venetian churches and other buildings, including 103 bell towers.The city is depicted in a realistic form, like a topographical landscape view, with large or important buildings generally depicted on the same scale as smaller or less important ones. The buildings and street plan are simplified in some areas, and the heights of many buildings are exaggerated, to make towers taller than they should be in proportion to their length or width: so for example the Doge's Palace is depicted about 50% taller than compared to its width.The apparent accuracy of the print has led some commentators to suggest that it may be based on a ground survey, perhaps with observations from the city's bell towers, but the analysis of Juergen Schulz in 1978 suggests this is not entirely correct. Rather, according to Schulz, de' Barbari seems to have started his drawing on the right side (east), perhaps based on plans used for maintenance of the city's waterways, and progressively compressed and distorted the scale as he ran out of space moving towards the left (west) edge. However Deborah Howard has suggested as the production of the work had taken three years and had been so expensive that the distortion was not an accident, and that the layout of the city in the woodcut was deliberately distorted for the iconographic purpose of making the shape of Venice resemble a dolphin, with its rounded head to the left and tail to the right. Howard notes the continued dolphin-like representation of the city's outline in maps made as late as the 19th century, echoing de' Barbari's print.


== Winds and deities ==
Around the edge are eight personifications of winds, two on each side, labelled with the names of the twelve classical compass winds or Anemoi: clockwise from the top, Septentrio (T), Aquilo and Fulturnus (G), Subsolanus (cross), Eurus and Eurauster (S), Auster (O), Auster Affricus and Affricus (A), Favonius (P), Corus and Circius (M). The letters refer to the traditional labels of the compass rose: Tramontana to the north, Greco to the northeast, Levante to the east, Sirocco to the southeast, Ostro to the south, Affricus to the southwest, Ponente to the west, and Maestro (Mistral) to the northwest. The positions of each wind are more determined more by artistic considerations than the true orientation of the city in the image.
At the top of the print is a depiction of Mercury, the Roman god of commerce, with the inscription ""MERCVRIVS PRECETERIS HVIC FAVSTE EMPORIIS ILLVSTRO""  (Latin: ""I Mercury shine favourably on this above all other emporia"". Neptune, Roman god of the seas, with a trident, rides a dolphin in the harbour, accompanied by an inscription reading ""AEQVORA TVENS PORTV RESIDEO HIC NEPTVNVS"" (Latin: ""I Neptune reside here smoothing the harbour waters""). The Latin title, ""VENETI[A]E"" is given in the locative case, specifically locating the image with the gods ""At Venice"" or ""In Venice"". The two gods are slightly offset from the centre of the composite print to lie either side of and emphasise the important area from the Rialto to the Piazza San Marco.


== Authorship and Publication ==
On 30 October 1500, the Signoria of Venice gave the publisher Anton Kolb an exemption from duties on the export of the print, and also the exclusive right to reproduce the print for the next four years. The publication of the print in October 1500 was independently mentioned in the contemporaneous diary of the Venetian writer Marino Sanuto the Younger. 
In his application to the Signoria, Kolb had stated that the print took three years to prepare, but he did not name the artist. Because of its high quality the print was traditionally attributed to Albrecht Dürer, but that attribution was doubted from the 18th century. Today it is confidently attributed to the Venetian painter and printmaker Jacopo de' Barbari, whose details recall German masters. He marks his works with the caduceus, in this case carried by the figure of Mercury at the top. Until his paintings were identified, his works were attributed to the notname ""Master of the Caduceus"". The windgods resemble the faces of his engravings. The attribution relies on stylistic and technical resemblances further as well as on the documented association with Kolb after the publication. Between 1500 and 1504 they were employed by Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor.Jacopos print is an accomplished High Renaissance work with detailed components compared to Rosselli's Florence print.


== Prints ==
To recoup the costs the prints had to be sold at least for three ducats, a considerable sum, similar to the monthly wage of a master painter. Examples soon entered the collections of wealthy collectors from church and state, who may have sufficient wall space to display the assembled composite print as intended, pasted on a linen support or directly onto the wall.
Three states of the print are known, with the second state in two variants. Around a dozen (different sources say 11, 12 or 13) impressions of the first state of the woodcut are known, and a similar number of the other two states.  The unusually large number of surviving prints suggests that the work was treated as a valuable work of art, rather than a working topographical image.  The first state published in 1500 shows St Mark's Campanile with a temporary flat roof after it was struck by lightning and caught fire in 1489.  The second state was published c. 1514; it was altered to show the Campanile as restored in 1511–4 after it was damaged by an earthquake in 1511, and the original date (MD - 1500) was removed: one variant leaves a blank space where the date was in the first state, and another fills the space with horizontal hatching.  The third state was published later in the 16th century, adding back the date (MD), and with the Campanile altered again to show a much cruder version of the flat-roofed depiction in the first state (but forgetting to remove the angel-shaped weather vane added on top of the tower in the adjacent sheet).


== Locations ==
Examples of the first state are held by several public collections.  Terisio Pignatti listed the locations of known prints in 1964, and several more have come to light since then.

Hinduism in Sri Lanka,"Hinduism is one of Sri Lanka's oldest religions, with temples dating back over 2,000 years. As of 2011, Hindus made up 12.6% of the Sri Lankan population. They are almost exclusively Tamils, except for small immigrant communities from India and Pakistan (including the Sindhis, Telugus and Malayalis). 
According to the 1915 census, Hindus made up about 25% of the Sri Lankan population (including indentured labourers brought by the British). Hinduism predominates in the Northern and Eastern Provinces (where Tamils remain the largest demographic), the central regions and Colombo, the capital. According to the 2011 census, there are 2,554,606 Hindus in Sri Lanka (12.6% of the country's population). During the Sri Lankan Civil War, many Tamils emigrated; Hindu temples, built by the Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora, maintain their religion, tradition, and culture.Most Sri Lankan Hindus follow the Shaiva Siddhanta school of Shaivism, and some follow Shaktism. Sri Lanka is home to the five abodes of Shiva: Pancha Ishwarams, holy places believed to have been built by King Ravana. Murugan is one of the country's most popular Hindu deities, venerated by Hindu Tamils. The Buddhist Sinhalese and Aboriginal Veddas venerate the local rendition of the deity, Katharagama deviyo.Yogaswami of Jaffna is a significant modern Hindu religious figure in Sri Lankan history. A 20th-century mystic, he was the Satguru and counselling sage of the country's Tamil Hindu population. The Ramakrishna Mission is active in the Amparai and Batticaloa districts, and the Shaiva Siddhanta school is prevalent in the north. Yogaswami was the 161st head of the Nandinatha Sampradaya, and was succeeded by Sivaya Subramuniyaswami.


== Legendary origins ==
The first major Hindu reference to Sri Lanka is found in the epic Ramayana. Lanka, identified with Sri Lanka, was ruled by the yaksha King Kubera. The throne of Lanka was usurped by Kubera's half-brother Ravana, the epic's chief antagonist, who was killed by Rama, the seventh avatar of Vishnu. Ravana’s brother Vibhishana was crowned as the new king by Rama before his return to Ayodhya. The Ramayana also mentions Rama's Bridge, between India and Sri Lanka, which was built with rocks by Rama with the aid of Hanuman, Nala, Nila, and other vanaras. Many believers see the chain of sandbar, connecting Sri Lanka to India in satellite images, as remnants of the bridge. Archaeological evidence supports the worship of Shiva in parts of Sri Lanka since prehistoric times, before the arrival of the legendary Prince Vijaya. Ravana is stated to have been a devotee of Shiva.


== Historic roots ==
The Nagas are claimed to have practised an early form of Hinduism, worshipping Shiva and serpents. This animistic Shaivism is also common in Tamil Nadu and other parts of India. The Nagas who inhabited the Jaffna Peninsula were probably the ancestors of Sri Lankan Tamils. There are also strong claims that they spoke Tamil as their native language but only small proof is found. The 5 ancient Shiva temples of Sri Lanka is also said to have been built by the Nagas before 6th century BCE. The Nainativu Nagapooshani Amman Temple in Nainativu is believed to be one of the Shakti Pithas.Buddhism was introduced by Mahinda, the eldest son of Ashoka, during the reign of Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura. His father Mutasiva and brother Mahasiva had names associated with Shiva suggesting prior Hindu beliefs. This is supported by the common occurrence of the personal name Shiva in the earliest Prakrit inscriptions. The Sinhalese embraced Buddhism, and the Tamils remained Hindus. Activity from across the Palk Strait in Tamil Nadu set the stage for Hinduism's survival in Sri Lanka. Shaivism (worship of Shiva) was dominant among the Tamils, and most of Sri Lanka's Hindu temple architecture and philosophy of Sri Lanka drew from that tradition. Sambandar noted a number of Sri Lankan Hindu temples in his works.


== Culture ==


=== Rituals ===
In common with South India, local rituals include Kavadi Attam and firewalking. These rituals have also influenced the Sinhalese on southern cost of the island; For an Instance, the inhabitants of Tangalle, Kudawella and the surrounding area perform Kavadi.


=== Religious teachers ===
Religious teachers include Kaddai Swami, his shishya Chellappaswami, and Chellappaswami's shishya Yogaswami. Swami Vivekananda the Bengali Hindu monk right after returning from West, started a series of lectures in India( British India at that time included Sri Lanka), from Colombo and Jaffna. The Hindus of Colombo and Jaffna received with much excitement and shouts of ""Har Har Mahadev"" and ""Jai Swami Vivekanandaji"" . 


=== Temples ===

			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
Most of the Hindu temple in Sri Lanka have Tamil architecture, most of which are ancient with a gopuram and a ratha in them. Alike many Hindu temples, which are dedicated to Hindu deities, many temples in Sri Lanka are also for their village deities which is mainly among the Tamil community.The Pancha Ishwarams are:

Naguleswaram temple in the North.
Ketheeswaram temple in the Northwest.
Koneswaram Temple in the East.
Munneswaram temple in the West.
Tondeswaram in the South.


== Demographics ==
According to the 1981 census, there were 2,297,800 Hindus in Sri Lanka; the 2012 census reported 2,554,606 Hindus in the country. Twenty thousand people died during the 2004 tsunami in LTTE-held areas alone.


=== Decadal population ===
The Hindu percentage has declined from 21.51% in 1881 to 12.58% in 2012. Mainly because of the indentured labourers brought by the British returning to India and immigration of Tamil Hindus caused by the Sri Lankan Civil War between 23 Jul 1983 – 18 May 2009. Around 1.5 lakh were killed and 1 million Tamils left Sri Lanka during that turmoil period.

Muldoanich,"Muldoanich is an uninhabited island in the Barra Isles archipelago at the southern extremity of the larger island chain of the Outer Hebrides in Scotland.

The island is 78 hectares (190 acres) in area and rises to a maximum height of 153 metres (502 ft) at the peak of Cruachan na h-àin (""midday hill"").Muldoanich stands about 4 kilometres (2+1⁄2 mi) southeast of  Castlebay, the main port on the island of Barra, and it is a prominent landmark for the approaching ferry and other craft. It has no level ground. There are no census records, but the southern headland of Vanish (meaning ""headland of the house"" or ""sacred place"" in Gaelic) may indicate habitation at some time in the past.


== Etymology ==
The name ""Muldoanich"" is probably the anglicised version of the Scottish Gaelic: Maol Dòmhnaich meaning ""Duncan's rounded hill"". It is shown with that name on Ordnance Survey maps. Mul Domhnach, meaning ""Sunday island"", is another possible derivation. Writing in the 16th century, Dean Munro referred to the island as ""Scarp"" and it appears as ""Scarpa"" on Blaeu's atlas of 1654.
Martin Martin refers to ""Muldonish"" in his 1695 voyage around the Western Isles, stating ""about a mile in circumference; it is high in the middle, covered over with heath and grass, and is the only forest here for maintaining the deer, being commonly about seventy or eighty in number.""

Nydam Mose,"The Nydam Mose, also known as Nydam Bog, is an archaeological site located at Øster Sottrup, a town located in Sundeved, eight kilometres from Sønderborg, Denmark.


== History ==
In the Iron Age, the site of the bog was a sacred place, where the weapons and ships of vanquished armies were offered to the indigenous gods in thanks for victory over the fallen enemy. Many items were deliberately destroyed (bent, broken or hacked into pieces) in ritual sacrificial acts, from the period 200–400 CE.
The first known finds from the bog date from the 1830s, when a local farmer gave old swords and shields as toys to his children.
Amongst numerous other items, three boats were found in Nydam Bog. In particular, the 23 m (75 ft) long oak boat, commonly known as ""the Nydam Boat"", maintains a distinguished position amongst Danish Iron Age finds, as it is one of the oldest known rowing vessel in Northern Europe (the Hjortspring boat, also found in Denmark, is even older). The oak boat (egetræsbåden) is on display at the archaeological museum in Gottorf Castle, Schleswig, Germany.


== Excavation ==


=== First excavation ===
From 1859 to 1863, archaeologist Conrad Engelhardt excavated the bog. Engelhardt found weapons, tools, pieces of clothing and two intact clinker built boats, one made of oak and one made of pine. The weapons include lances, spears, bows, arrows and round shields. Under these finds were the remains of a third boat, which apparently had been demolished already during the sacrifice.
Engelhardt's work ceased with the outbreak of the Second Schleswig War in early 1864. Some of the discoveries from the bog were lost during the Second Schleswig War. The smaller of the two boats, perhaps 19 meters long and made of pine, was hacked up and used as firewood by troops.


=== Second excavation ===
The National Museum of Denmark resumed excavation of the bog in 1989. During excavation a large quantity of weapons have come to light, in the form of swords, spears, bows and arrows; and also personal effects such as belt buckles, brooches and ornate clasps. These finds originate from the Iron Age, in the period between 250–550 CE.


== Nydam boat ==
The Nydam Mose sacrifice site was probably used on different occasions during the years 200–450 CE. Conrad Engelhardt on August 17, 1863 discovered the Nydam Boat. The oak boat was the first and largest of the three boats that were found in the Nydam bog, and the only one still preserved (the pine boat was entirely destroyed during the Second Schleswig War). It has been dendro dated to 310–320 CE. It is 23 m (75 ft) long, c. 3.5 m (11 ft) wide, of  clinker type, weighed over three tonnes, had 14 pairs of oars and likely had a crew of around 45 men. After losing the war and part of the country, Denmark was forced to transfer the Nydam Boat to Prussia and today it is displayed at Gottorf Castle in Schleswig, Germany.


== Nydam Society ==
Interest in the archaeology of Nydam Bog has always been particularly lively in the local area. The Nydam discoveries were and remain a significant theme in the relationship between Danish and German cultures in the border region. On this basis, the ""Society for Nydam Research"" – commonly known as the Nydam Society - was formed in 1983. Through its work, this interest group has contributed to the resumption of National Museum of Denmark's investigation of the bog.
Today, the site is a green meadow. Parking is available on Nydamvej. From here, there is a path (Nydamstien) to the small white house, Nydamhuset, which is situated beside the site of the archaeological discoveries. It takes about 10 minutes to walk there.
The Nydam Society's long-standing desire to build a replica of the Nydam Boat has been realized. The Nydam Tveir was built employing the techniques of the time – both to exploit the material characteristics of the timber and to develop an understanding of how large vessels were built in that period. Construction of a replica of the Nydam Boat was based on the oak boat found in 1859. The construction of the Nydam Boat was divided into two phases. Phase 1 was a feasibility study to investigate the construction of the boat. Here the builders investigated prerequisites and gathered experience for use in Phase 2, which comprised building the complete boat.

Victor Bernal (politician),"Victor Luís Bernal Garay is a Paraguayan senator for the Colorado Party and the former director of the bi-national hydroelectric enterprise Itaipú. He is an accountant by profession. An official investigation of Bernal's finances began while he was at Itaipú and continued into his years in the Senate. An attempt was made to impeach him, and both he and his wife, María Elizabeth Pleva, spent years engaged in legal battles over charges of embezzlement.


== CEO of Itaipú ==
Bernal was appointed Paraguayan director of Itaipú in September 2003. Itaipú, which is jointly owned by Brazil and Paraguay, describes itself as “the largest power producer in the world” and says that its mission is to “generate quality electricity via socially and environmentally responsible practices, and to foster sustainable economic, tourist, and technological development in Brazil and Paraguay.” Its energy source is the Itaipú Dam, the world's largest hydroelectric dam, which is located on the Paraná River on the border between Brazil and Paraguay. The dam was named one of the seven wonders of the modern world in 1994 by the American Society of Civil Engineers.During his tenure at Itaipú, under President Nicanor Duarte Frutos, Bernal was one of the most influential figures in Paraguayan politics.


== Bernal relatives employed by Itaipú ==
Bernal's wife, María Elizabeth Pleva, served as assistant Paraguayan director of Itaipú under Bernal, and his brother Oscar was on the staff of Itaipú's Retirement and Pension Fund, a job that, according to the Paraguayan newspaper ABC, Itaipú, involved little or no work. His nephew Luis Benítez Bernal worked in Human Resources at Itaipú; a cousin, José Luis Bernal Sanabria, worked for Itaipú's Tesãi Foundation; another cousin, Nilda Garay Pereira, worked for Itaipú's pension fund, a job that was described by ABC as having “no known functions”; Luis Francisco Pereira Vigo, a nephew of Bernal's first wife, worked as an assistant to Bernal.
As of 2007, Bernal's son Hugo, who was in his twenties, was reportedly earning a high salary as an adviser at the U.S. Embassy in Paraguay, even though he was not a career diplomat, which is ordinarily a requirement for such positions.


== Salary ==
During his time at Itaipú, Bernal earned a total of G 4,004,670,277 in salary, and his wife earned G 1,596,560,135. They also made G 1,000,000,000 from selling property.


== Controversial lifestyle ==
Beginning on 9 September 2007, ABC ran a series of articles about the Bernal family. The first article, headlined “Pornographic display of wealth by Victor Bernal and his family,” began by listing several examples to illustrate the Bernal family's opulent lifestyle.In the concluding article in the series, the ""new 'royalty'"" was said to have replaced the ""old 'barons'"". It was noted that Pleva enjoyed a “title and salary at Itaipú, plus a vehicle, driver, fuel, and bodyguards.”In an October 2007 article about Bernal's acquisition of wealth and land, it was noted that his property and money were the result of ""miraculous multiplication"". On just two properties, Bernal had spent G 1,300 million, almost twice his annual salary of G 720 million.


== Resignation ==
Bernal resigned from Itaipú in January 2008 to run for the Paraguayan senate, and was paid G 303,266,890 by Itaipú in compensation for his period of service. On 17 January, President Nicanor Duarte announced that Ramón Romero Roa would replace Bernal.


== Senator ==
In the Paraguayan general election on 20 April 2008, Bernal was elected to the Senate.


=== Committees ===
In the Senate, Bernal has sat on the following permanent committees: 

Hacienda, Presupuesto y Cuentas -  2008-9, 2009–10, 2010–11, 2011–12, 2012–13
Energía, Recursos Naturales, Población, Ambiente, Producción y Desarrollo Sostenible -  2008-9, 2009–10, 2011–12, 2012-13
Economía, Cooperativismo, Desarrollo e Integración Económica Latinoamericana -  2009-10, 2010–11, 2011–12, 2012-13
Cuentas y Control de la Administración Financiera del Estado -  2011-12, 2012–13He has sat on the following bicameral committee:  

C.Bicameral Encargada del Estudio del Presupuesto General de la Nación, Ejercicio Fiscal 2011,  Fiscal 2012


== Senatorial activities and related events ==
Bernal denounced the Ministries of Public Health, Agriculture, and Education in May 2012 for using their resources for political purposes.A large group of young people gathered outside Bernal's home in June 2012 to protest his involvement in the impeachment of President Fernando Lugo.Bernal called in January 2013 for an end to negotiations between the Paraguayan government and the power company Rio Tinto Alcan, questioning the price the firm was charging for energy.


== Legal difficulties ==
During his tenure as CEO of Itaipú, and also during his subsequent service in the Paraguayan Senate, Bernal has been the subject of several different investigations and prosecutions based on his activities while working at Itaipú. He was investigated for overcharging for public-works projects in the town of Minga Guazú that were paid for by Itaipú; for diverting Itaipú assets to finance campaigns by Colorado Party candidates in 2007 and 2008; for misusing public-works funds; for embezzling; and for using Itaipú-owned assets to purchase equipment for the Tesãi Foundation.ABC noted on 5 March 2008 that Bernal had bought space in its pages to deny facts that the paper had reported about his use of funds from Itaipú that were supposed to be spent on public-works projects in the town of Minga Guazú in Alto Paraná. Yet Bernal had “not offered a single document in proof” of his claims. By contrast, ABC maintained, the evidence of his guilt was ample. ABC added that “Bernal said yesterday that this daily had cut off contact with him. This is false. For a year, we have sought answers to simple questions about the use of the binational's funds. He has not yet granted an interview. Or responded to our questionnaires.”Prosecutor Sergio Alegre of the Attorney General's Office asked Judge Ruben Ayala Brun on 16 April 2008 to dismiss an embezzlement complaint filed against Bernal by public advocate Edgar Villalba and by Gerardo Rolón Pose and Nils Candia Gini, presidents of the Democratic and Revolutionary Febrerista parties, respectively. The prosecutor requested the dismissal because a study of Bernal's and his wife's finances indicated that their joint legal income over a period of years had exceeded their expenditures, a finding which, if confirmed, would leave Ayala Brun with no choice other than to dismiss the charges. Ayala Brun asked the Attorney General to ratify or rectify the opinion, whereupon deputy prosecutor Carlos Arregui, head of the Economic Crime and Anti-Corruption Unit, intervened, arguing that there were points that had to be investigated before the complaint could be dismissed or a criminal case opened. It was reported on 24 April 2008 that the Attorney General had ten working days, beginning on 23 April, to respond to the prosecutor's request to dismiss the case.The Prosecutors' Office was accused of making an “undisguised attempt to launder the new Colorado Senator Victor Bernal,” as demonstrated by the unusual speed with which Alegre had upheld the embezzlement complaint dismissal against Bernal. Noting that Alegre had ignored evidence that ABC itself had supplied in earlier articles, Reinfeldt described the prosecution as “one of the poorest” Alegre had ever carried out, and noted that the judge had “bounced” Alegre twice “in a desperate attempt to secure a better investigation....Through negligence or ignorance, or deliberately, Alegre has ignored fundamental principles that are employed in the judiciary to carry out a proper investigation of embezzlement that encompasses everyone in the closest ring surrounding Bernal.”Alegre was informed on 8 May 2008 by Arregui that the latter would continue to pursue a prosecution of Bernal for embezzlement during his tenure at Itaipú. On 16 May 2008, Arregui announced that he was opening a criminal investigation into Bernal's use of public-works funds, and said that he had jurisdiction to investigate acts by Itaipú in Paraguay.Luis Alberto Franco wrote a letter to Alegre in June 2008 denying charges that he was a front man for Bernal.A September 2008 overview of government corruption in Paraguay mentioned Bernal as a “man of humble origin” who in slightly over five years had become “an owner of mansions and ranches” and joined the list of Paraguay's leading billionaires, and who now, as a recently elected Senator, enjoyed “parliamentary immunity.”It was reported on 2 September 2008 that Bernal, while serving as CEO of Itaipú, had violated its internal controls by personally authorizing millions in disbursements without any verification. After an audit by Ramón Romero Roa, also a former Itaipú director, Bernal was investigated for diverting more than G 34 billion from Itaipú to the Tesâi Foundation.Itaipú's Paraguayan director, Carlos Mateo Balmelli, accused Bernal and Ramon Roa, another former Itaipú director, on 21 October 2008, of embezzling about 34 billion Gs. Mateo said that Itaipú's lawyers had requested the impeachment of Bernal in order to “facilitate the investigation.” On the same date Mateo made public a report on the Tesãi Foundation, which, according to an external audit, had been used to drain funds from Itaipú.It was reported on 4 November 2008, that four companies apparently hired by Itaipú during Bernal's tenure to do campaign work for the Colorado Party had billed Itaipú a total of over G 22 billion (U.S. $4.7 million). The firms were operated under the direction of Alejandro (Sasha) Evreinoff, brother-in-law of Wilfrido Taboada, Itaipú's CFO and Bernal's right-hand man.In late November 2008, lawyers for Bernal, appearing before the Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court, appealed the decision of State Attorney General Ruben Candia Amarilla to appoint Rocio Vallejo to investigate illegal political funding during Bernal's tenure at Itaipú. Meanwhile, Arregui ordered Acuña to continue looking into the alleged campaign funding.Judge Patricia González was appointed in December 2008 to adjudicate a case brought against Bernal by prosecutor Gustavo Gamba, who accused him of squandering funds intended to be transferred from Itaipú to Minga Guazú for public-works projects. On 10 December, Bernal was charged with breach of trust for his leadership of Itaipú. On 11 December González said that she would seek Bernal's impeachment. On 18 December, González sent a message to the Paraguayan Congress ordering that Bernal be impeached by the Senate for breach of trust. On 19 December Gonzalez approved Bernal's application for parliamentary immunity, while Gamba insisted that impeachment proceedings against Bernal go forward.The Paraguayan Court of Appeals decided on 10 February 2009 to take on the case against Bernal in the matter of the Minga Guazú funds.Acuña refused on 19 February 2009 to dismiss a complaint that Bernal, in 2006, while serving as director of Itaipú, had ordered the purchase for $450,000 of an MRI scanner that became unusable after a brief period. The charge was part of the case involving the Tesãi  Foundation.As of May 2009, the charges against Bernal relating to the use of Itaipú funds to pay Colorado Party campaign expenses were being officially investigated by Evreinoff.Prosecutors taped Bernal on 3 June 2009 delivering an initial payment of $90,000 to Gamba in return for Gamba's promise to dismiss one of five cases pending against Bernal involving his reported misuse of funds while serving as director of the Itaipú. On 8 June 2009, it was reported that Gamba would be prosecuted on charges of seeking a bribe from Bernal. Allegedly, Gamba, acting through lawyer Juan Portillo, had demanded a payout of $150,000, with a first payment of $90,000, in exchange for dropping the case against Bernal. Bernal reported Gamba to the authorities, and the prosecutor was secretly filmed accepting money.The head of Itaipú, Carlos Mateo Balmelli, told Radio Primero de Marzo in June 2009 that Bernal had spent five million dollars on social events during his tenure at Itaipú and that he, Mateo, would be filing charges against Bernal with Attorney General Amarilla.It was reported on 9 July 2009 that Gamba had been replaced as prosecutor on the Minga Guazú case by Eduardo Cazenave, who was planning to travel to Alto Paraná to investigate the disappearance of G. 380,418,219 in funds designated for Minga Guazú. The same article reported that the proceedings against Bernal were stalled in the Supreme Court.The Criminal Chamber of the Paraguayan Supreme Court, ruling in favor of a motion by Bernal, removed Arregui and fellow prosecutors Rocio Vallejo and Arnaldo Giuzzio on 15 July 2009 from the case against Bernal on which they had been working.It was reported on 23 June 2009 that the director of Itaipú  had requested that investigations of Bernal being carried out by the Economic Crimes and Corruption Unit be transferred to the public prosecutor's office, but Amarilla expressed support for the unit and ordered that the investigations remain in its hands.Prosecutor Victoria Acuña of the Economic Crimes Unit announced on 30 July 2009 that she was investigating the alleged use of Itaipú funds during Bernal's tenure to pay campaign expenses incurred by the Colorado Party in the 2008 general elections.Prosecutors accused Gamba on 4 December 2009 of soliciting a $150,000 bribe from Bernal. Gamba was suspended from his position, while Bernal's senatorial position was protected by political immunity.ABC ran an article early in 2010 claiming that the legal process against Bernal had been stalled because of “chicanery.”An ABC article on 24 May 2010 summed up Bernal's complex legal situation as of that date. Alegre was investigating embezzlement charges; Acuña was investigating the use of public-works funds to pay the Colorado Party's campaign expenses in the 2008 general election; Cazenave was investigating accusations of overcharging in the matter of Minga Guazú; and Silvia Cabrera was investigating the abuse of Itaipú  funds via the Tesãi  Foundation. Alegre had tried to “launder” Bernal by “archiving” charges against him, but this had been blocked by Judge Ruben Ayala Brun, with Arregui insisting on the need for further investigation. “It is not easy to pursue investigations against the 'big boys,'” ABC observed, noting that Roberto Melgarejo, husband of Judge Gonzalez, who was in charge of the Minga Guazú case, is a friend of Bernal, “and there is talk that they would be negotiating to 'launder'” him. Meanwhile, Bernal's “request for immunity remains frozen in the judiciary.”It was announced in February 2011 that Bernal would not be tried for irregularly appropriating funds designated for public-service outlays in Minga Guazú. District Attorney Victoria Acuña indicted a former CFO of Itaipú and two other Itaipú officials, however, for using these funds to pay campaign expenses for Bernal and others.Bernal met with Arregui and Alegre on 17 March 2011 to discuss their separate investigations of him. An ABC report noted that these meetings between Bernal and the investigators had become common. Meanwhile, Victoria Acuña, Eduardo Cazenave, and Humberto Otazú were investigating other charges against him. Also, Silvia Cabrera was looking into charges of embezzlement relating to the Tesãi Foundation that had been raised by Carlos Mateo Balmelli. In reply to Balmelli's charges, Bernal called him a liar and a “scoundrel”.It was reported on 4 September 2011 that Acuña had decided to officially charge Wilfrido Taboada, Rulfo Velilla Aguilera, and Guido Roque Zacarías Michelagnoli with using Itaipú funds to pay Colorado Party campaign expenses. She did not charge Bernal, even though he was CEO of Itaipú at the time and his senatorial campaign was one of those that most benefited from the alleged diversion of funds.After an investigation of the finances of Bernal and his family that lasted from 2001 to 2011, it was reported in February 2012 that the embezzlement case against Bernal and Pleva was close to being dismissed because the prosecution's expert, Graciela Alvarez, had not found anything incriminating. In April 2012, it was reported that Álvarez and defense expert Víctor González had both rendered opinions in Bernal's favor, although some questions remained, especially in regard to Bernal's alleged front men, including Juan Ángel Chávez, Cristóbal Chávez, Félix Benítez Molas, Luis Alberto López Zayas, and Óscar René Cabrera Rodríguez, plus Luis Pereira Vigo and Fernando José Vera Vigo, the latter two being nephews of Bernal's ex-wife, Natividad Mercedes Lugo. The questions surrounded, among other things, the formation of a company called SOL 25 and the purchase of a large property in Villeta known as Potrero Guyratî for a suspiciously low price.It was reported on 30 May 2012 that Alegre would not be charging Bernal and Pleva with embezzlement, given that their reported income exceeded their reported expenditures. In June 2012, Judge Rubén Ayala Brun upheld Alegre's request to dismiss the case brought by Gerardo Rolón Posse and Nils Candia against Bernal and his wife on charges of embezzlement. The judge noted, however, that the cases against alleged front men Ricardo Giménez Benítez, Luis Pereira Vigo y Jorge Pereira Vigo, Fernando José Vera, Juan Ángel Chávez, Alberto Franco Maciel, Óscar Cabrera Rodríguez, Luis Alberto López, and Félix Benítez Molas, and against Natividad Mercedes Lugo, remained “on standby.”It was reported on 2 October 2012 that Judge Miguel Tadeo Fernandez had ordered Acuña to spend another year investigating the alleged use under Bernal's tenure at Itaipú of public-works funds to pay campaign expenses incurred in 2008 by the Colorado Party.On 15 October 2012, it was reported that Gamba and Portillo had been officially charged with receiving a bribe from Bernal.On 16 October Acuña asked for a dismissal of a case against Bernal's Itaipú  associates Wilfrido Taboada Molinas, Rulfo René Velilla Aguilera, and Guido Roque Zacarías Michelagnoli, saying that the evidence that Itaipú  funds had been used to pay Colorado Party campaign expenses was inconclusive. On 11 November, however, ABC stated that the evidence, to which the newspaper had access, proved that Itaipú  funds had been spent on the party's 2008 campaign.It was again reported on 2 November 2012 that Bernal would not be prosecuted for alleged misuse of the Minga Guazú funds.On 12 November it was reported that the Ministry of Health had not signed any agreement with Itaipú to combat dengue, thereby supporting charges that more than G. 1,100 million in Itaipú funds purportedly spent on an anti-dengue campaign had in fact been spent on the Colorado Party's 2008 election campaign. Later in November, Acuña asked Judge Tadeo Fernandez to dismiss the charges that Itaipú funds had been used to pay campaign expenses. On 29 December it was reported that Tadeo Fernandez had finally dismissed the charges against Rulfo René Velilla Aguilera, Guido Guillermo Roque Zacarías Michelagnoli, and Wilfrido Emigdio Taboada.


== Recommended for return to Itaipú ==
Senator Juan Carlos “Calé” Galaverna of the Colorado Party recommended to the party's presidential candidate, Horacio Cartes, in December 2012 that if he wins the 2013 general election, he should appoint Bernal to the position of Paraguayan director of Itaipú.

"Bernard FitzPatrick, 2nd Baron Castletown","Bernard Edward Barnaby FitzPatrick, 2nd Baron Castletown, KP, CMG, PC (I) (29 July 1848 – 29 May 1937) was an Anglo-Irish soldier and Conservative Member of Parliament.


== Biography ==


=== Life ===
Castletown was the son of John FitzPatrick, 1st Baron Castletown, and his wife Augusta Mary (née Douglas), and was educated at Eton and Brasenose College, Oxford.He was appointed High Sheriff of Queen's County in 1876, and sat as Member of Parliament for Portarlington from 1880 to 1883, when he succeeded his father in the barony and entered the House of Lords.
He served in the Life Guards and fought in Egypt in 1882. After he resigned from active service, he was appointed to the Reserve of Officers in 1886, serving as a volunteer officer until reaching the age limit in March 1900. He was promoted major on 8 June 1896, and later lieutenant colonel in command of the 4th (Militia) Battalion of the Leinster Regiment (Queen's County Militia) from October 1899, and was the first to outfit them with Irish bagpipers. In February 1900 he left for South Africa, where he was posted on special service during the Second Boer War. In recognition of services during the war, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the South African Honours list published on 26 June 1902.In early 1902 he took part in a special diplomatic mission to promote British interests in Morocco.Along with Theodore Roosevelt and Douglas Hyde and others, he was elected honorary Vice President of the Irish Literary Society of New York in 1903. In 1905, he proposed a tillage farming plan along the lines of Ireland's old clan system. Castletown was later Chancellor of the Royal University of Ireland between 1906 and 1910.


=== Theft of the Irish Crown Jewels ===
The Irish Crown Jewels were discovered missing on 6 July 1907, four days before the start of a visit to the Irish International Exhibition by King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, at which was planned the investiture of Bernard FitzPatrick, 2nd Baron Castletown into the Order. The theft is reported to have angered the King, but the visit went ahead. However, the investiture ceremony was cancelled. Also stolen were the collars of five Knight Members of the Order.  The following year in 1908 he was made a Knight of the Order of St Patrick and admitted to the Irish Privy Council.  His banner still hangs in St. Patrick's Hall in Dublin Castle.


=== Family and Death ===
Lord Castletown married the Hon. Emily Ursula Clare St Leger, daughter of the 4th Viscount Doneraile, in 1874. The marriage was childless. Lady Castletown joined her husband in South Africa in early 1900, when he was posted there during the Second Boer War.He died on 29 May 1937 at Granston Manor, aged 87, when the barony became extinct.Castletown was particularly interested in Celtic heritage, and was among the founders of the Celtic Association, an organisation concerned with the preservation of the languages, literature, music, dress and customs of the Celtic peoples. In 1900, the Celtic Association was set up in Dublin with Castletown as president and E.E. Fournier as secretary. The Celtic Association is mainly remembered for the three Pan-Celtic Congresses it organized: the first in Dublin in 1901, the second in Caernarfon in 1904, and the last in Edinburgh in 1907. The first Congress had been scheduled for 1900, but had to be postponed when Castletown was called to service in the Boer War. The Association was not without its detractors, in part because many of the Irish sympathized with the Boers.
Originally made up of representatives from Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Brittany, and the Isle of Man; Cornwall was added in 1904.

In Melody Maker David Bennun observed that it was ""a remarkably straightforward album"" for Johnson and wrote, ""Like Nick Cave, Johnson protects himself from the ridicule he invites with bombastic self-caricature. When he lets this slip, he's left with an album that, although frequently absorbing, is still as inherently laughable as any The The album. Dusk needs time to grow; it deserves it. But while it takes it, the Dogs of Lust are closing in, howling with mirth."" Sam Samuelson of AllMusic declared it one of Johnson's ""most accomplished products to date."" ""Slow Emotion Replay"" was the 94th best-selling single in Iceland.

== Biography ==
Anthony Lawrence Cohen was born on 4 June 1957 in Melbourne.: 1  His father, Philip Cohen, was an Australian son of Jewish migrants from Manchester, Philip had converted to Roman Catholicism before marrying Margaret, who was an Australian of Irish descent.: 1–2  He grew up in suburban East Ringwood where he attended St Francis de Sales Primary School.: 1  The family moved to Mentone, along with younger brother Martin, where Cohen was enrolled at St Bede's College for his secondary education.: 4  While at Bede's he started taking drugs including marijuana/hash, amytal and LSD, which adversely affected his academic progress.: 3–5  Cohen started to play the drums when the family had moved to the neighbouring suburb of Cheltenham and formed a friendship with fellow aspiring drummer, Chris Thompson.: 7  He later recalled, ""Neither of us were very good drummers I might admit but we shared a mutual love of music and playing."": 7 Cohen, aged 15, joined a rock, glam rock band Epitaph on drums for a year.: 9–12  He bought a four-track recorder to tape their work and then recorded other local groups.: 12  During school holidays in mid-1973 he spent two weeks doing work experience at Armstrong Studios. His friend Thompson went along for a day and both decided on a career in the recording studio. After work experience he refused to return to school but continued at the studios, ""No one said anything, so I stayed."": 13  For two years he was a ""shit-kicker"", and started by, ""cleaning the toilets and getting the lunches and stuff, and then got promoted to mono dubbing boy."": 15  By 1975 Cohen began working as a sound engineer under the guidance of Roger Savage.: 15  In April of the following year he was working as an assistant record producer, alongside Molly Meldrum, on Perth's glam rock group, Supernaut's lead single, ""I Like It Both Ways"" (May 1976). Cohen produced the group's associated self-titled album, which appeared in November of that year, and its follow-up single, ""Too Hot to Touch"" (September).In July 1976 Cohen and fellow engineer, Ian MacKenzie, met with Meldrum to organise the production of pop group, the Ferrets' debut album, Dreams of a Love: ""It was all a bit of Elton John, a bit of the 'Real Thing', [Meldrum] called us in for a production meeting 9:00 in the morning at his place and he was still in bed [...] and putting the music on [...] very, very loud and then proceeds to shout at you over the top of it, and we were all sitting there sort of terrified thinking, what on earth is he saying?"" After a year production was still incomplete so the Ferrets took over, together with Cohen and MacKenzie assisting. It was finalised in August 1977 and released in October with Meldrum credited as Willie Everfinish.In June 1978 Cohen started working with the Boys Next Door (later renamed the Birthday Party), as engineer at Richmond Recorders on their debut album, Door, Door (1979). He then engineered the Birthday Party's early extended play, Hee Haw (December 1979). Next he was the engineer and producer, on their second album, The Birthday Party (November 1980). He was engineer and producer for their third album, Junkyard (May 1982), which was listed in the book, 100 Best Australian Albums at number 17.: 72–3  Cohen told the authors that he was directed, ""Forget all the bottom end and the rich, lush sounds. Make it sound like trash."": 72–3  He continued as engineer and/or producer for the group's leader, Nick Cave, in the related group, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. From From Her to Eternity (18 June 1984) to No More Shall We Part (2 April 2001). Cohen followed the group to London in mid-1986 and then on to Berlin in January 1987 to continue to work with Cave.: 113, 120  He returned to Melbourne in January 1988 with his drug habit ""spiraling out of control."": 137 Cohen reflected on his early work with Cave, in an interview with Richard Fidler in September 2006, ""[it] was all very experimental then, because we were all learning – I fell in love with this new way of recording... because there were no rules. We were looking for sounds that made your fillings drop out rather than pleasant pop tunes, so we got to do crazy things like find concrete stairwells and abuse equipment, so it was all very attractive for me. Some of it didn't work, but as history has shown Nick really honed his craft, he's done some brilliant records... some of the early stuff was a bit rough but it was a learning curve then."" Ed Nimmervoll, an Australian music journalist and editor of Rock Australia Magazine, recalled ""Nick Cave's Birthday Party were allowed to take up some of the studio time slack. Rather than [go] home, their producer Tony Cohen slept in the air conditioning duct.""A long-term working relationship had also been established with Tex Perkins, starting with the singer's alternative rock group, Beasts of Bourbon's 1984 album, The Axeman's Jazz. Cohen had engineered and produced it during a single eight-hour session at Paradise Studios in Sydney, in October of the previous year, with label boss Roger Grierson as executive producer. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, ""Legend has it that the session was fuelled by 72 cans of beer and one bottle of Scotch, and that it only ended when the band members began passing out!"" He produced their next studio album, The Low Road, (December 1991). In the following year he was their engineer, producer and mixer for a five-track EP, Just Right, which had been recorded live at the Prince of Wales Hotel in May 1991 by Cohen's childhood friend, Chris Thompson.Cohen's services were used for Perkins' next band the Cruel Sea on their second studio album, This Is Not the Way Home (October 1991). He was nominated at the ARIA Music Awards of 1993 for Producer of the Year for that album and for ""Get Thee to a Nunnery"", a track on TISM's EP, The Beasts of Suburban (20 July 1992). He worked for an ad hoc country blues trio of Perkins, Don Walker and Charlie Owen, as Tex, Don and Charlie on their debut album, Sad But True (November 1993).: 218–9  While recording that album he was interviewed in the studio by Kerry Negara, the director of SBS-TV's Nomad. At the following year's ARIA Awards ceremony he won Producer of the Year for the Cruel Sea's third album, The Honeymoon Is Over (May 1993).: 174–5 In 1995 he won both Engineer of the Year and Producer of the Year. Over the previous 18 months – the eligibility period – Cohen had produced Let Love In (Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, 18 April 1994), You Wanna Be There But You Don't Wanna Travel (Dave Graney 'n' the Coral Snakes, June 1994), Parables for Wooden Ears (Powderfinger, 18 July 1994), Livin' Lazy (Maurice Frawley and Working Class Ringos, 1994), Three Legged Dog (the Cruel Sea, April 1995), Kim Salmon and the Surrealists (Kim Salmon and the Surrealists, April 1995) and Mouth to Mouth (the Blackeyed Susans, July 1995).In the 2000s Cohen's name started appearing less regularly on album credits. During 2003 he worked as a remix engineer on Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' old master tapes for Stephen Petronio's contemporary dance work, Underland. Cave was unable to provide new tracks for the project due to time conflicts but allowed his material to be used. Cohen had effectively retired in 2004–2005. He emerged in 2017 to produce Augie March's album Bootikins, as he had always wanted to work with the group. He died unexpectedly before the album's sessions concluded, and Augie March leader Glenn Richards stated ""It still amazes me that we got a chance to work with the man. The moments are ours and we will cherish them ... He got us feeling like and playing like a real band again after a long interim, and we made some very good music together."" In November 2017 Cohen was posthumously inducted into the Music Victoria Hall of Fame. A memoir of his life, Half Deaf, Completely Mad, was published by John Olson in November 2023.

Tony Cohen had an on-again off-again relationship with Joanne from mid-1981, she had been Chris Thompson's girlfriend when they met. They lived together initially in Elsternwick, then Sydney and back, again.: 59–61, 100  His drug habit now included amphetamine and heroin.: 59–61  By early 1983 Cohen was also dating a different woman, Josephine, whom he married on 28 May 1983, in Melbourne.: 100  According to his brother, ""I don't think Tony ever had a distinct line between dumping one girl and getting on with another."": 100  The couple moved to Sydney in late 1983 and then back to Melbourne in July of the following year.: 109  Cohen and Josephine relocated to London in mid-1986 before they separated (and later divorced). He then moved to Berlin in January 1987,: 113–4, 120  and returned to Australian early in the next year.: 137 Early in 1991 Cohen began a relationship with Astrid Munday, a vocalist for country music groups Killer Sheep and then Desert Boot.: 138, 146  After living together in Sydney they moved in with Cohen's parents at their rural property at Kongwak, Victoria in November 1991.: 147  At different times he attempted to curb his alcohol and drug dependencies.: 149  The couple returned to Melbourne in February 1992.: 151–2  Cohen had earlier been diagnosed with hepatitis C, then pancreatitis (September 1992) and diabetes (October).: 157  At the ARIA Music Awards of 1995 he had a hypoglycaemic event, ""just as they announced my name so I was in the suit and everything and sweat was just dripping off me so I had to go and hide up the back and Molly was standing on the seat going 'Where are you? Tony, where are you?' So it wasn't a great memory for me... I couldn't get up on stage and make a speech... you know, my blood sugar had dropped and I was a mess; such a shame."": 167 In late 2000 Cohen and Munday moved to London, where he worked on No More Shall We Part (April 2001) for Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, while Munday worked as a temporary teacher.: 171–2  By that stage Cohen's diabetes was worsening and his studio attendances became erratic. After the recording sessions ended he struggled to get further work in London and so returned to Melbourne.: 171–4  By 2004 or 2005 he was in semi-retirement, ""In a bid to rid himself of a renewed taste for drugs and to revive his ailing health."": 178 His health continued to deteriorate into the 2010s. Tony Cohen died on 2 August 2017 at Dandenong Hospital, aged 60. Although no cause of death was reported, his sibling recalled, ""Tony lived a hard life with drugs and alcohol playing a big part of his professional career. He did give them up many years ago but always knew that he would eventually pay for his 'sins'."" Conversely, ""we were like chalk and cheese. But, I loved him and fully respect what he achieved in his career. He was technically brilliant, but also a caring, big-hearted man."" Upon the inclusion of Cohen's work in the Australian Music Vault, his mother Margaret stated, ""it wasn't until his untimely death, that I was made aware of the esteem that he was held in by so many people. I am proud of his contribution to the rock and roll music industry here and all that he achieved through his life."" A suitcase of cassette tapes he used as back-ups of recordings was donated to the vault. Munday released an album with material dedicated to her husband, Beauty in the Ordinary, in August 2020.

List of Grand Prix motorcycle racing World Constructors' Champions,"Grand Prix motorcycle racing is the premier championship of motorcycle road racing, which has been divided into three classes: MotoGP, Moto2, and Moto3. Classes that have been discontinued include 500cc (although 500cc statistics are combined with MotoGP officially), 350cc, 250cc, 125cc, 80cc, 50cc and Sidecar.  The Grand Prix Road-Racing World Championship was established in 1949 by the sport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), and is the oldest motorsport World Championship.There were five classes when the championship started in 1949; 500cc, 350cc, 250cc, 125cc and sidecar (600cc). The 50cc class was introduced in 1962. Due to escalating costs that resulted in a number of manufacturers leaving the championship, the FIM limited the 50cc bikes to a single cylinder, the 125cc and 250cc bikes were limited to two cylinders and the 350cc and 500cc bikes were limited to four cylinders. The 350cc class was discontinued in 1982, two years later the 50cc class was replaced with an 80cc class, which was discontinued in 1989. The sidecar class left the series to form its own championship after 1996. In 2002, 990cc four stroke engined bikes replaced the 500cc bikes and the class was renamed as MotoGP. 600cc four-stroke bikes replaced the 250cc bikes in 2010, with the class rebranded as Moto2. Since 2012, the Moto3 class (250cc four-stroke one cylinder) replaced the 125cc class.
The 750cc was never part of the Grand Prix motorcycle racing series.
The Constructors' World Championship is awarded to the most successful constructor over a season, as determined by a points system based on Grand Prix results. Only the highest-scoring rider in each race for each constructor contributing points towards the Championship. The winner of the constructors' world championship is not necessarily the bike used by the riders' world champion. For example, in 2004, Valentino Rossi who rode a Yamaha bike won the riders' world championship, but in the constructors' standings, Honda have higher points than Yamaha, therefore Honda won constructors' world championship.
For the sidecar class, the constructors championship went to the engine manufacturer, not the chassis manufacturer.  For the Moto2 class, the championship goes to the chassis manufacturer, not the engine manufacturer, since all competitors are required to use spec engines provided by Triumph (Honda from 2010 until 2018).


== By year ==
1954 Constructors' titles were not recognized by the Federation following a political crisis with the constructors (represented by the International Permanent Bureau of Motorcycle Manufacturers) concerning the number of races to be held during the season and the abolition of the riders' championship.

Mr. Moto's Last Warning,"Mr. Moto's Last Warning is the sixth in a series of eight films starring Peter Lorre as Mr. Moto.The film is an original story featuring the character created by John P. Marquand.


== Plot ==
The British Navy in Port Said is making plans for naval manoeuvres with the French fleet. Plans are delayed because the British Secret Service has been warned of possible sabotage. On a ship docking in Port Said is Madame Delacour (Margaret Irving), wife of the French naval admiral. Delacour and her daughter Marie (Joan Carroll) are befriended by the charming Eric Norvel (George Sanders), the goofy Rollo Venables (Robert Coote), and someone posing as Mr. Moto (Teru Shimada). Norvel reveals his true nature when the ship docks and he lures Mr. Moto to his death. This ""fake"" Mr. Moto turns out to be a fellow agent of Mr. Moto (Peter Lorre) who is posing as a curio dealer Mr. Kuroki.
Norvel takes Delacour and Venables to a variety show featuring Fabian the Great (Ricardo Cortez), a ventriloquist. Fabian is the leader of the gang of saboteurs including Hakim (John Davidson), Captain Hawkins (Leyland Hodgson), Danforth (John Carradine), and Norvel. Danforth is actually a British Secret Service agent named Burke. Moto listens in on their conversation and is almost captured, but Burke helps him escape. Norvel is given the task of learning from Delacour when the French fleet is due at Port Said.
The suspicious Fabian thinks that Kuroki may actually be Mr. Moto. Fabian enlists his girlfriend Connie (Virginia Field), who is unaware he is an agent, to follow Mr. Moto the next day. She sees Moto visit the Port Commandant's office where he learns of the salvage ship ""The Vulcan"" captained by Hawkins.
Fabian also discovers that Danforth is the secret agent, Burke.  Fabian lures Burke to ""The Vulcan"" and reveals his plan to blow up the French fleet and blame the British.  He then kills Burke by trapping him in a diving bell.  Norvel gets the information needed and tells Fabian at the theater.  Connie overhears the conversation and threatens to call the Port Commandant, but Fabian convinces her to go along with him.
Hakim tries to kill Moto with a bomb, but Moto escapes the explosion and follows Hakim to a warehouse.  Moto enlists Venables to help, but Venables is tricked by Norvel.  After a fight, Moto and Venables are tied in sacks and thrown into the ocean, but not before Moto tricks Hawkins and grabs a piece of sharp metal.  Connie can't bear to see this violence and goes to call the police.  Fabian knocks her out and proceeds with his plans.
Moto escapes underwater and frees Venables, who goes to the police.  Norvel dives down to await a signal from Fabian but Moto overpowers him and prematurely detonates the explosives meant to destroy the French fleet.  Resurfacing, Moto fights with Fabian but Connie shows up and shoots Fabian.  Moto discovers the saboteur's plans in Fabian's dummy but never reveals to the audience which country tried to engineer a war between France and England.

Filming on this one started in June 1938.Virginia Field also appeared in the first film of the series, Think Fast, Mr. Moto. John Carradine had previously appeared in Thank You, Mr. Moto.

== Reception ==
The film was released in January 1939. The New York Times thought the ""method"" used by Moto was ""a little tough on the audience"" but praised the ""rousing old fashioned climax"". The Los Angeles Times gave the film ""faint praise"" saying it was ""routine"".

List of Reel Big Fish members,"Reel Big Fish is an American ska punk band from Los Alamitos, California. Formed in December 1991, the group originally consisted of vocalist Ben Guzman, guitarists Aaron Barrett and Lisa Smith, bassist Matt Wong, keyboardist Zach Gilltrap and drummer Andrew Gonzales. The group's current lineup features Barrett, who took over as lead vocalist in 1993, alongside trumpeter John Christianson (since 2004), bassist Derek Gibbs (since 2007), saxophonist Matt Appleton (since 2011), drummer Ed ""Smokey Beach"" Larsen (since 2014) and trombonist Brian Robertson (since 2019).


== History ==
Reel Big Fish was formed as a hard rock outfit in December 1991. The original lineup featured Ben Guzman, Aaron Barrett, Lisa Smith, Matt Wong, Zach Gilltrap and Andrew Gonzales, who released the band's first self-titled demo tape (known as In the Good Old Days...) in 1992. By the following year, Barrett had taken over on lead vocals and decided to pursue a ska direction for the group, which was now a three-piece comprising himself, Wong and Gonzales. For their second self-titled demo (known as Return of the Mullet), the trio employed the services of trumpeter Eric Vismantas and saxophonist Stephan Reed.
By 1994, the band had added Tavis Werts on trumpet, Dan Regan on trombone and Adam Polakoff on saxophone, who released Buy This! that year. By the time the group recorded its debut full-length album Everything Sucks, Robert Quimby had joined as a second trombonist. Quimby and Polakoff left before Turn the Radio Off, on which second trumpeter Scott Klopfenstein and new trombonist Grant Barry debuted. During the tour in promotion of 1998's Why Do They Rock So Hard?, Gonzales left in February 1999 to ""pursue other interests and spend more time at home"". He was followed the next month by Barry, who was dismissed for ""personal differences"".With new drummer Carlos de la Garza, Reel Big Fish recorded much of Cheer Up! during 2000, before Werts quit in October 2001 and recording was completed by Tyler Jones, who took over his position the next month. In the summer of 2003, de la Garza was replaced by Justin Ferreira, a bandmate of Barrett's in the Forces of Evil. Another member of the Forces of Evil, trumpeter John Christianson, replaced Jones following his departure in September 2004. In 2005 the band released We're Not Happy 'til You're Not Happy, before Ferreira left in early 2005 and was replaced by Ryland Steen. Monkeys for Nothin' and the Chimps for Free followed in July 2007.In June 2007, founding member Matt Wong announced his departure from the band in order to ""settle down and be a family man""; he was replaced by the Forces of Evil bassist Derek Gibbs. The new lineup released Fame, Fortune and Fornication in 2009, followed by A Best of Us... for the Rest of Us and Skacoustic in 2010. In January 2011, long-term trumpeter and multi-instrumentalist Scott Klopfenstein left the group for a similar reason as Wong, stating that he wanted to ""dedicate his life to raising a family"". John Christianson subsequently became the band's sole trumpeter, as Klopfenstein was replaced by Goldfinger touring saxophonist Matt Appleton.After the release of Candy Coated Fury in 2012, another long-term horn player, trombonist Dan Regan, left the band in October 2013 to focus on life with his family. He was replaced by Billy Kottage. In the summer of 2014, Steen left to tour with America and was replaced by Ed ""Smokey Beach"" Larsen. This lineup released one album, Life Sucks... Let's Dance! in 2018, before Kottage was replaced in the summer of 2019 by Brian Robertson of Suburban Legends.

Specific phobia,"Specific phobia is an anxiety disorder, characterized by an extreme, unreasonable, and irrational fear associated with a specific object, situation, or concept which poses little or no actual danger. Specific phobia can lead to avoidance of the object or situation, persistence of the fear, and significant distress or problems functioning associated with the fear. A phobia can be the fear of anything.
Although fears are common and normal, a phobia is an extreme type of fear where great lengths are taken to avoid being exposed to the particular danger. Phobias are considered the most common psychiatric disorder, affecting about 10% of the population in the US, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), (among children, 5%; among teens, 16%). About 75% of patients have more than one specific phobia.
It can be described as when patients are anxious about a particular situation. It causes a great load of difficulty in life. Patients have a lot of distress or interference when functioning in their daily life. Unreasonable or irrational fears get in the way of daily routines, work, and relationships due to the effort that a patient makes to avoid the terrifying feelings associated with the fear.Females are twice as likely to be diagnosed than males with a specific phobia (although this can depend on the stimulus).Children and adolescents who are diagnosed with a specific phobia are at an increased risk for additional psychopathology later in life.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Fear, discomfort or anxiety may be triggered both by the presence and the anticipation of the specific object or situation. The main behavioral sign of a specific phobia is avoidance. The fear or anxiety associated with specific phobia can also manifest in physical symptoms such as an increased heart rate, shortness of breath, muscle tension, sweating, or a desire to escape the situation.


== Causes ==
The exact cause of specific phobias is not known. The mechanisms for development of specific phobias can be distinguished between innate (genetic and neurobiological) factors, and learned factors. 
In neurobiology, one explanation proposed for specific phobia is that the typical activation of the amygdala in response to stimuli may be exaggerated due to pathological changes. According to this theory, a deficiency in amygdala habituation may also contribute to the persistence of non-experiential phobia. Certain phobias that are less lethal (e.g. dogs) seem to be more frequently observed and easily acquired in comparison to potentially lethal fears which are more relevant to developed human society (e.g. cars and guns). This was theorised to be due to biological adaptation being passed through evolution which makes recent threats less prone to easy acquisition. However, a 2014 study found evidence against this evolutionary theory, which stated: ""Our findings are inconsistent with the hypothesis that fears/phobias of individual stimuli result from genetic and environmental factors unique to that stimulus. Instead, we observed substantial sharing of risk factors across individual fears."" There is also evidence for the validity of a genetic component contributing to blood-injection-injury phobias and animal phobias, although this evidence did not support the idea that other specific phobias had genetic influence. Blood-injection-injury phobias are also believed to be the most heritable among specific phobias.The classical conditioning model of learning has also been used to suggest that a phobia will be learned when an event that causes a fear or anxiety reaction is paired with a neutral event. An example of this model is when being near a dog (neutral event) is paired with the emotional experience of being bitten by a dog, resulting in a chronic fear which is described as a specific phobia to dogs. An alternative proposed mechanism of association is through observational learning. According to this theory, a person may internalize another person's fears about a specific object or situation through observation of their reactions.


== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis in the ICD or the DSM requires a marked fear, anxiety or avoidance that is long-lasting (greater than six months) and consistently occurs in the presence of the feared object or situation. The DSM-5 that the fears should be out of proportion to the danger posed, compared to the ICD-10 which specifies that the symptoms must be excessive or unreasonable. Minor differences have persisted between the ICD-11 and DSM-5.In the DSM-5, there are several types which specific phobia can be classified under:

Animal type – Including fear of spiders (arachnophobia), insects (entomophobia), dogs (cynophobia), or snakes (ophidiophobia).
Natural environment type – Including fear of water (aquaphobia), heights (acrophobia), lightning and thunderstorms (astraphobia), or aging (gerascophobia).
Situational type – Including the fear of small confined spaces (claustrophobia), or the dark (nyctophobia).
Blood/injection/injury type – Including fear of medical procedures, including needles and injections (trypanophobia), fear of blood (hemophobia) and fear of getting injured (traumatophobia).
Other – Situations which can lead to choking or vomiting, and children's fears of loud sounds or costumed characters.Although the avoidance resulting from specific phobia is comparable to other anxiety disorders, differential diagnosis is done through examining underlying causes for the behavior. Agoraphobia is also considered distinct from specific phobia, along with substance use disorders, and avoidant personality disorder. The occurrence of panic attacks is not itself a symptom of specific phobias and falls under the criteria of panic disorder.


== Treatment ==
There are a variety of treatment options available for specific phobias, most of which focus on psychosocial interventions. Different psychological treatments have varying levels of effects depending on the specific phobia being addressed.


=== Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) ===

Cognitive behavioral therapy is a short term, skills-focused therapy that aims to help people diffuse unhelpful emotional responses by helping people consider them differently or change their behavior. CBT represents the gold standard and first line of therapy in specific phobias. CBT is effective in treating specific phobias primarily through exposure and cognitive strategies to overcome a person's anxiety. Computer-assisted treatment programs, self-help manuals, and delivery by a trained practitioner are all methods of accessing CBT. A single session of CBT in one of these modalities can be effective for individuals who have a specific phobia.


=== Exposure therapy ===

Exposure therapy is a particularly effective form of CBT for many specific phobias, however, treatment acceptance and high drop-out rates have been noted as concerns. In addition, a third of people who complete exposure therapy as a treatment for specific phobia may not respond, regardless of the type of exposure therapy. Other interventions have been successful for particular types of specific phobia, such as virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) for spider, dental, and height phobias, applied muscle tension (AMT) for needle phobia, and psychoeducation with relaxation exercises for fear of childbirth. With exposure therapy, a type of cognitive-behavioural therapy, clinically significant improvement was experienced by up to 90% of patients. While very long-term outcomes remain unknown, many of the benefits of exposure therapy persisted after one year. Treatment may be more successful at reducing symptoms in people with low trait anxiety, high motivation, and high self-efficacy entering exposure therapy. In addition, high cortisol levels, high heart rate variation, evoking disgust, avoiding relaxation, focusing on cognitive changes, context variation, sleep, and memory-enhancing drugs can also reduce symptoms following exposure therapy.Exposure can be ""live""(in real life) or imaginal (in ones imagination) and can involve:

Systematic desensitization—A therapy that exposes the person to increasing levels of vivid stimuli gradually and frequently, while instructed to relax.
Flooding—A therapy that exposes the person with a specific phobia to the most fearful stimulus first (i.e. the most intense part of the phobia). Patients are at great risk for dropping out of treatment as this method repeatedly exposes the patient to the fear.
Modeling—This method includes the clinician approaching the feared stimuli while the patient observes and tries to repeat the approach themselves.Exposures that are imaginal are less effective.Specifically for acrophobia, in-vivo exposure (exposure to real-world height-scenarios while maintaining anxiety at controlled levels) has been shown to significantly improve measures of anxiety in the short-term, but this effect decreased over a longer term. Likewise, virtual reality exposure was statistically significant in some measures of anxiety reduction, but not others.


=== Pharmacotherapeutics ===
As of late 2020, there is limited evidence for the use of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of specific phobia. Pharmacological treatments are typically used in combination with behaviorally-focused psychotherapy, as introducing pharmacological interventions independently may result in relapsing of symptoms. Different treatments are better suited for certain types of specific phobia. For instance, beta blockers are useful in those with performance anxiety.  The selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), paroxetine and escitalopram, have shown preliminary efficacy in small randomized controlled clinical trials. However, these trials were too small to show any definitive benefits of anxiolytic medication alone in treating phobia. Benzodiazepines are occasionally used for acute symptom relief, but have not been shown to be effective for long-term treatment. There are some findings suggesting that adjuvant use of the NMDA receptor partial agonist, d-cycloserine, with virtual reality exposure therapy may improve specific phobia symptoms more than virtual reality exposure therapy alone. As of 2020, studies on the use of adjunct d-cycloserine are inconclusive.


== Prognosis ==
The majority of those that develop a specific phobia first experience symptoms in childhood. Often individuals will experience symptoms periodically with periods of remission before complete remission occurs. However, specific phobias that continue into adulthood are likely to experience a more chronic course. Specific phobias in older adults has been linked with a decrease in quality of life. Those with specific phobias are at an increased risk of suicide. Greater impairment is found in those that have multiple phobias. Response to treatment is relatively high but many do not seek treatment due to lack of access, ability to avoid phobia, or unwilling to face feared object for repeated CBT sessions.


== Epidemiology ==
Specific phobia is estimated to affect 6-12% of people at some point in their life. There may be a large amount of underreporting of specific phobias as many people do not seek treatment, with some surveys conducted in the US finding that 70% of the population reports having one or more unreasonable fears.Specific phobias have a lifetime prevalence rate of 7.4% and a one-year prevalence of 5.5% according to data collected from 22 different countries. The usual age of onset is childhood to adolescence. During childhood and adolescence, the incidence of new specific phobias is much higher in females than males. The peak incidence for specific phobias amongst females occurs during reproduction and childrearing, possibly reflecting an evolutionary advantage. There is an additional peak in incidence, reaching nearly 1% per year, during old age in both men and women, possibly reflective of newly occurring physical conditions or adverse life events. The development of phobias varies with subtypes, with animal and blood injection phobias typically beginning in childhood (ages 5–12), whereas development of situational specific phobias (i.e., fear of flying) usually occurs in late adolescence and early adulthood.In the US, the lifetime prevalence rate is 12.5% and a one-year prevalence rate of 9.1%. An estimated 12.5% of U.S. adults experience specific phobia at some time in their lives and the prevalence is approximately double in females compared to males. An estimated 19.3% of adolescents experience specific phobia, but the difference between males and females is not as pronounced.

Xigou,"Xigou  (Chinese:細狗), also known as Xiquan  (Chinese:細犬), Xiliegou (Chinese:細獵狗) and Chinese Xiquan (Chinese:中國細犬), is a breed of sighthound native to China. Xigou is a rare dog breed.


== Background ==
Xigou is an ancient native dog breed in China. Xigou is currently known to be 2,500 years old. Xigou has always been popular with nobles and citizens of Chinese dynasties.There are traces of Xigou in many Chinese tombs and cultural relics.
While some cynologists speculate just might be the principal ancestor of all sighthounds known today, others indicate some intermixing with modern stock, pointing to greyhounds shipped to China by the East India Company. Once used to chase and capture prey on the open, flat land of the Huangtu Plateau, the breed is now in trouble, its numbers plummeting as a result of the government curbing the rights of its citizens to hunt. The China Kennel Union (CKU) classifies the breed as ‘rare,’ and is trying to resurrect it. To that end, the CKU initiated an effort to collect DNA from the dogs in 2017.


== Appearance ==
Xigou is lanky, 60 to 78 centimetres (24 to 31 in) tall and weighs between 20 and 30 kilograms (44 and 66 lb). Xigou has a long and narrow head, a flat forehead, small spacing between ears, drooping ears, a slender neck, a slender waist, a curved back, and a long tail. It is divided into short-haired and feathered species, etc. Coat colors include yellow, black, brown, white, and fawn red.


== Variety ==
The existing Xigou species mainly include Shaanxi Xigou (Chinese: 陝西細狗), Hebei Xigou (Chinese: 河北細狗), Shandong Xigou (Chinese: 山東細狗) and Mongolian Xigou (Chinese: 蒙古細狗), etc.


=== Shaanxi Xigou ===
The Shaanxi Xigou, also known as Shaanxi Hound or Xian Hound (獫), is an ancient and rare breed that originated in China. These majestic dogs are skilled hunters, dependable guard dogs, and devoted companions. Some experts believe the Shaanxi Xigou is the original sighthound breed. The Shaanxi Xigou is characterized by a long, narrow sheep-like head, but not all descendants will necessarily inherit this head type.


=== Hebei Xigou ===
Hebei Xigou is a rare breed in China. Hebei Xigou is similar in appearance to Greyhound. Hebei Xigou is mainly used for hunting hares.Hebei Xigou is very loyal to the owner, has a strong memory, a keen sense of smell, a high desire to hunt, and has good endurance. It is suitable for hunting in the plains and can also be used as a guard dog.


=== Shandong Xigou ===
The Shandong Xigou is a rare breed with a keen sense of smell and innate hunting instinct.
Shandong Xigou once served as the royal hunting dog of the Tang dynasty and has been a reliable hunting dog for centuries. In fact, in addition to working with hunters, this breed excels at protecting livestock on farms.


=== Mongolian Taiga dog ===
The Mongolian Taiga , also known as Khitan Hound (Chinese: 契丹獵犬). Mongolian Taiga is an ancient hunting breed known for its tenacity, keen sense of smell, and running ability.Mongolian Xigou was loved by some northern aristocrats in Chinese history who used Mongolian Xigou as a hunting dog and watchdog.Experts believe the Mongolian Xigou originated from one of the oldest dog breeds, the Saluki. Once a top hunting dog in Northeastern Mongolia, this breed is relatively rare today.

William Herbert Waring,"William Herbert Waring VC MM (13 October 1885 – 8 October 1918) was a Welsh recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.
He was born and lived in Welshpool, Montgomeryshire.
He was 32 years old, and before World War I had been a member of the part-time Montgomeryshire Yeomanry. In 1918 he was serving as a lance-sergeant in the 25th (Montgomery and Welsh Horse Yeomanry) Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers, British Army, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 18 September 1918 at Ronssoy, France, Lance-Sergeant Waring led an attack against enemy machine-guns and in the face of devastating fire, single-handed rushed a strong-point, bayoneting four of the garrison and capturing twenty, with their guns. The lance-sergeant then reorganized his men, leading and inspiring them for another 400 yards when he fell mortally wounded.Waring died 20 days later and is buried at Ste Marie Communal Cemetery, Le Havre, Seine Maritime, France.A stone to commemorate his life was installed in the wall of the Welshpool Town Hall and unveiled in January 2015.His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Welch Fusiliers Museum, Caernarfon Castle, Gwynedd, Wales.

Sandnes Church (Rogaland),"Sandnes Church (Norwegian: Sandnes kirke) is a parish church of the Church of Norway in the large Sandnes municipality in Rogaland county, Norway. It is located in the borough of Trones og Sentrum in the centre of the city of Sandnes in the far western part of the municipality. It is the church for the Sandnes parish and it is the seat of the Sandnes prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Stavanger. The red, brick church was built in a long church design in 1882 using plans drawn up by the architect Hartvig Sverdrup Eckhoff. The neo-gothic church seats about 420 people.


== History ==
The city of Sandnes was established as a ladested in 1860 and at the same time it was separated from the large municipality of Høyland. The city was without a church of its own for its first 22 years in existence. During that time, residents of Sandnes municipality (and parish) had to go to the nearby Høyland Church, located in outside of the city (and in a different parish). It wasn't until 1880 when the parish began to raise funds and construct the new church. The new church was completed in 1882. When the church was renovated in 1962–1963, the nave and choir were extended in order to enlarge the church.

    {\displaystyle T}
   as above  has

        )
        =
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle R(T)=Y}
   if and only if the transpose 
  
    
      
        
          T
          ′
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T'}
   has a continuous inverse.  Similarly, 
  
    
      
        R
        (
        
          T
          ′
        
        )
        =
        
          X
          ′
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R(T')=X'}
   if and only if 
  
    
      
        T
      
    
    {\displaystyle T}
   has a continuous inverse.

Dikaia railway station,"Dikaia railway station (Greek: Σιδηροδρομικός Σταθμός Δικαίων, romanized: Sidirodromikos Stathmos Dikeon) is a railway station that serves the village of Dikaia, Evros in Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, Greece. Located less than 900 metres (3,000 ft) east of the centre of Dikaia, the station opened in 1874 by the Chemins de fer Orientaux (now part of OSE). Today TrainOSE operates just four daily regional trains to Alexandroupoli and Ormenio. The station is unstaffed however there are waiting rooms available. It is one of the northernmost operational railway stations in Greece, close to both the Bulgarian and Turkish borders.


== History ==
The station opened in 1874 when the line, built by the Chemins de fer Orientaux, from Istanbul to Vienna opened. The railway reached Dikaia in 1873, when the line from Istanbul to Edirne and Bulgaria was opened. When the railway was built it was all within the Ottoman Empire.
During World War I, the railway was an important link as the Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria and Austria-Hungary were all Central Allies. On 14 December 1916 Allied (British or French, it is not clear), aeroplanes bombed the bridge over the river Evros.After the Ottoman Empire's defeat, its remaining imperial possessions were divided. The sections from Alexandroupoli to Svilengrad, except for a short section of about 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) in Turkey serving Edirne Karaagaç station and for 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) between the Greek border and Svilengrad station in Bulgaria come under the control of the French-Hellenic Railway Company, a subsidiary of the Chemins de fer Orientaux, when the French-Hellenic was incorporated in July 1929.
Under the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923, a new border between Greece and Turkey was established at the Evros river, just east of Ftelia railway station, which had the result that the railway from Istanbul to Bulgaria entered Greece at Pythio, then re-entered Turkey at Edirne (Karaağaç railway station), re-entered Greece at Marasia, and finally entered Bulgaria between Ormenio and Svilengrad.  This arrangement continued until 1971, when two new lines were opened. In Turkey, the Edirne Cut-off was opened to allow trains from Istanbul to Bulgaria to run through Edirne entirely on Turkish territory, so that trains such as the Orient Express no longer passed through Feres. In Greece, a line was opened to allow trains from Pythio to Bulgaria to stay on Greek territory and avoid Edirne. In 1954 the CFFH was absorbed by the Hellenic State Railways. In 1971, the Hellenic State Railways was reorganised into the OSE taking over responsibilities for most for Greece's rail infrastructure.
In the 1990s, OSE introduced the InterCity service to the Alexandroupoli–Svilengrad line Which reduced travel times across the whole line.
In 2020 it was announced that a section of the line between Pythio and Ormenio was to be upgraded at a cost of €1.4 million as part of an ambitious integrated intergovernmental transport plan which will see this, and 39 other transport sector projects be built, with financing from the European Commission with a total of €117 million. The package of measures aims to build or improve transport connections and connectivity across Europe, with a focus on sustainable transport. The project for the Pythian-Ormenio section envisions upgrading the existing line infrastructure and trackbed, doubling of the track as well as the installation of electrification signalling (ETCS Level 1) along the entire stretch, with the aim of improving freight transport with Bulgaria and Turkey.


== Facilities ==
The station has no facilities. It is equipped with a small waitingroom but little else. The platforms have no outside seating, Dot-matrix display departure and arrival screens or timetable poster boards for passenger information, and the station remains little more than an unstaffed halt.


== Services ==
As of 2020, the station is only served by only one daily pair of regional trains Alexandroupoli–Ormenio. There are currently no services to Svilengrad.

Postcard (Steven Wilson song),"""Postcard"" is the first single from Grace for Drowning, the second solo studio album, by British rock musician Steven Wilson. It was released digitally on 10 October 2011. The single includes the album version, a live piano/vocal version, a remix by Scottish new prog group North Atlantic Oscillation, and a remix of another track from the same album, ""Index"".


== Reception ==
Reception for the song has been generally positive, with critics praising it for being more melodic and accessible than much of the Grace for Drowning album. William Ruhlmann of Allmusic interpreted it to be a song about lost love, writing, ""In the relatively sparse lyrics that Wilson sings with a calm, British-accented tenor, he seems melancholy at first, apparently suffering from the aftermath of a romantic breakup. ""There's nothing left for me to say or do,"" he declares in Postcard.""  Brice Ezell of Popmatters described it as one of the most accessible, melodic, and strongest songs of the album. Similarly, Metal Buzz described the song as ""Wilson's attempt at Coldplay"", and Alternative Matter compared it to music from Blackfield, Wilson's melodic pop rock side project. American Aftermath called it a ""gorgeous ballad"" that ""could fill even the coldest shell of a person with emotion"".

Authority bias,"Authority bias is the tendency to attribute greater accuracy to the opinion of an authority figure (unrelated to its content) and be more influenced by that opinion. An individual is more influenced by the opinion of this authority figure, believing their views to be more credible, and hence place greater emphasis on the authority figure's viewpoint and are more likely to obey them. This concept is considered one of the social cognitive biases or collective cognitive biases.Humans generally have a deep-seated duty to authority and tend to comply when requested by an authority figure. Some scholars explain that individuals are motivated to view authority as deserving of their position and this legitimacy leads people to accept and obey the decisions that it makes. System justification theory articulates this phenomenon, particularly within its position that there is a psychological motivation for believing in the steadiness, stability and justness of the current social system.Authority bias can be measured concerning respect for authority, where higher respect for authority positively correlates with the increased likelihood of exhibiting authority bias. Respect for authority is measured using the Respect for Authority Index (RAI), which averages responses on deference to the police. A higher score on the RAI is indicative of higher respect for authority, and hence strengthening the execution of authority bias.
Cultural differences in the strength of authority bias have been identified, in which the differences in edits made to Wikipedia articles by administrators and regular users were compared for accuracy. In Western Europe, the bias has a negligible effect. In Eastern Europe, the bias is larger and the administrator's edits are perceived as more likely to be true (despite the edits being inaccurate), indicating a cultural difference in the extent to which authority bias is experienced.


== Definition ==
Authority bias, a term popularised by American psychologist Stanley Milgram, is defined as having an unreasonably high confidence in the belief that the information verified by a person with formal authority is correct, and therefore an individual is likely to be more influenced by them. Individuals in positions of authority are seen to be treated more favourably, where people believe their views with increased certainty, though the role of authority alone is not always significant enough to directly affect decision-making without this phenomenon being used in conjunction with other heuristics and biases.
The antonym of authority bias is blanket opposition to authority, disregarding their knowledge and believing authority figures to have inherently false claims. This relates to the view of anti-authoritarianism.
Authority bias has many explanations, rooted in the human need to obey authority figures. Namely, authority bias can be explained through evolutionary and social means. 


== Legitimacy of authority ==
Authority bias is greater when the authority figure in question is seen to be legitimate, that is they are accepted to be in an authorized position of relative power, and have the right to demand obedience. Research has highlighted certain important characteristics that can mark one as a legitimate authority figure, strengthening authority bias, with individuals more likely to be influenced by and obey such figures. These markers can affect whether people regard an individual as an authority figure.


=== Relative position in the social hierarchy ===
All societies are structured in a hierarchical manner, and often those who possess a higher social status are situated further up the hierarchy. The majority of people accept that in order to maintain a co-operative, functioning society and avoid social chaos, a certain degree of individual choice must be relinquished to authority figures, often representing government institutions, whose role means they have greater status in the social hierarchy. For example, most accept that in the criminal justice system, the police have the right to exercise power over others and apprehend wrongdoers, as their role indicates their position in the social hierarchy and their authority. This is often instilled in children from a young age, with parents instructing them to defer to authority figures such as teachers and policemen and accept the opinions of authority figures as correct. There is also a tendency to attribute greater accuracy to and respect the opinions of experts such as doctors. For example, most people have complete confidence in their doctor treating them, as a trusted authority figure with a high social status. This normative behavior can be a useful shortcut, but blind acceptance of expert advice can raise issues if it becomes an automatic response. This was demonstrated by a study conducted by the psychiatrist Charles Hofling, who found that 21 out of 22 nurses would have given patients a potentially fatal dose of a drug when asked to by a doctor despite this instruction contravening official guidance forbidding the administration of the drug. Similar studies in other areas of society have demonstrated the problems that can arise as a result of unquestioningly accepting the opinions of those regarded as having higher status in the social hierarchy.


=== Uniform ===
Outward appearance can signify an individual's social status and relative position in the social hierarchy, and consequently whether they are perceived as a legitimate authority figure. When examining authority bias, outward appearance, manifested in clothing, in particular uniform, seems to have a profound effect on whether an individual is respected and obeyed as an authority figure. Research conducted by Bickman and colleagues found that passers-by were twice as likely to obey a confederate dressed as a security guard rather than a milkman when asked by the individual to complete tasks such as picking up litter or lending the confederate a coin for the parking meter. The effects of uniform on authority bias has been a fairly consistent and reliable finding as other studies, such as those run by Milgram, have reached similar conclusions. In a variation of his original experiment, Milgram found that obedience levels dropped from 65% to 20% when the instructions to enable shocks were given by an ordinary member of the public wearing plain clothes rather than a researcher (signified by a white lab coat). In the real world, attention bias may also play a role here, with people selectively paying more attention to the uniform as an important symbol of power, attributing greater accuracy to the opinions of the wearer and displaying more obedience to that figure in response. However, it is important to recognize that factors like uniform are situational and easily changed. Thus, an individual may masquerade as an authority figure and can elicit the authority bias response from others, even though their authority may not be truly legitimate. Though situational factors may point to an authority figure, the effects of authority bias may be stronger when such situational factors are combined with innate factors, such as gender.


=== Gender ===
Evidence also suggests that gender can be important in signifying an authority figure. A subset of authority bias, namely gender-authority bias explains how in particular, women may be more susceptible to authority bias than males. In addition to women being more influenced by authority figures than males, female authority figures may be less influential than their male counterparts. Research has shown that both men and women associated men with high authority roles and women with low authority roles, showing how gender can signify an authority figure and subsequently influence authority bias. As a result, confirmation bias may also play a role here in what people interpret to be a characteristic of an authority figure; as many associate higher-authority roles with males, confirmation bias suggests that people will tend to look for, favor, interpret a recall information that fits with this belief, perpetuating this bias, reinforcing the idea of males being more legitimate as authority figures. Gender-authority bias has been demonstrated across a variety of real-world sectors. In politics, research into leadership using the Implicit Association Test (IAT) found that female political leaders tend to face greater resistance to their authority in comparison to their male counterparts. Authority bias is therefore strengthened when an authority figure is male instead of female in politics. In finance, males are often favored as authority figures, being perceived to have greater control of resources, and able to make better decisions, demonstrated by the fact that they hold higher positions and on average earn 66% more than females in the finance industry. Research also suggests that women are more susceptible to authority bias, as they are more influenced than men by hearing fake news from an authority figure.


== Discovery ==
Prior to psychological research, the most common example of this phenomenon was when people obeyed Hitler during World War II, though such effects have been evident throughout history. This relates to pluralistic ignorance, in which authority figures are obeyed regardless of immorality.
The term “authority bias” was first mentioned in literature in reference to state authority bias, in which it simply indicated a preference for being pro-state or anti-state in the US federal election.Nevertheless, the first-time authority bias was referenced in literature as a cognitive bias was a result of Milgram's experiment, in which it was used to explain obedience to authority figures. Whilst Milgram did not directly use the term ""authority bias"" in his 1963 paper, the obedience effect identified from his study became the primary example of authority bias.  Milgram's findings succeeded the reason why people during World War II obeyed Hitler; participants voluntarily submitted to the authority figure (the experimenter wearing a white lab coat, signifying professionalism). Authority bias is further strengthened through the use of uniforms to signify authority, initially investigated in Milgram's situational variable (where obedience decreased when the uniform of the experimenter was changed from a lab coat to everyday clothes), but further replicated through Bickman's infamous research into obedience, where security guards are more likely to be obeyed without question and thus contributing directly to authority bias.


== Real-world effects ==


=== Advertising ===
Authority bias is used as a marketing strategy in order to increase the legitimacy of claims made about a product. A common example in advertising is where toothpaste companies such as Sensodyne promote the validity of their claims by ensuring the dentists wear lab coats, resulting in the consumer being more trustworthy of the product and consequently more likely to buy the product.
Personalised advertising in relation to political voting attitudes (particularly in the US election) relies on authority bias. Political campaigns are targeted specifically towards female voters (who are more susceptible to the bias), amplified through the use of social media, in which political leaders and other figures of authority are used in ad-campaigns to increase the effectiveness of their claims.


=== Medicine ===
The expert halo effect is synonymous with authority bias in medicine, where the expert is seen as infallible. Issues arise in pharmaceutical settings, in which non-experts blindly follow expert's commands, resulting in the distribution of harmful drugs and inappropriate healthcare practices.A further issue concerning the extent to which an authority figure is perceived to be providing accurate information is apparent in cases such as that of Willie Jackson. Forensic dentistry falsely proved Jackson to be guilty, yet the authority bias strengthened the doctor's standpoint in a court of law as they had expert authority bias.  Consequently, the negative effect of authority bias has led to wrongful convictions.


=== Business ===
The authority bias is demonstrated in the case of the highest-paid persons' opinion (HIPPO) impact, which describes how employees and other stakeholders in the solution environment tend to go with the opinions and impressions of the highly paid people in an organization.


== Explanations ==


=== Evolution ===
Evolution has established a dominance hierarchy in which it is an evolutionary advantage to obey authority figures, as figures of authority have a greater allocation of resources and other means of survival. The logical fallacy of ad verecundiam is evolutionary, highlighting that experts are more reliable due to a lack of opposing information, increasing trustworthiness.


=== Societal benefits ===
In any society, a diverse and widely accepted system of authority allows the development of sophisticated structures for the production of resources, trade, expansion and social control. Notions of obedience and loyalty to the legitimate rule of others are generally accorded values in schools, the law, the military and in political systems. The strength of the bias to obey a legitimate authority figure comes from systemic socialization practices designed to instill the perception that such obedience constitutes correct behavior, and that genuine authority figures usually possess higher degrees of knowledge, wisdom and power. Different societies vary the terms of this dimension. As a result, authority bias can be rooted in the underlying social norms of society. Consequently, deference to authority can occur mindlessly as a kind of decision-making short cut.


== The role of other heuristics and biases ==
Research support for the strength of authority bias is evident, however, the effect is not significant in some instances. Research is merely correlational, and hence other behavioural effects experienced in conjunction with authority bias strengthen its effects.


=== Confirmation bias ===
An individual exhibiting authority bias may also be subject to experiencing confirmation bias, which is the tendency to search for information that confirms your own existing beliefs. Research suggests that greater authority is given to financial advisors who confirm one's existing opinions, implying that authority bias is strengthened when it coincides with confirmation bias.


=== Bandwagon effect ===
The bandwagon effect is where people adopt the ideologies of those surrounding them. Society favours the opinions of authority figures, hence it is a majority view which others support.

Nobody's Watching,"Nobody's Watching is a 2005 US television program that was never broadcast. It originated with and was written by the creator of Scrubs, Bill Lawrence, as well as Neil Goldman and Garrett Donovan, writers for Scrubs and Family Guy.


== Program history ==
The pilot was developed for the WB Television Network, but network executives passed on the show for the 2005 schedule after test audiences seemed to be confused by its premise. However, in June 2006, the pilot was leaked onto YouTube and quickly attracted attention from viewers around the world. On July 3, a report in the New York Times suggested that the show could yet make it to a full series, thanks to the positive response from YouTube viewers. During the Friday, July 21, 2006, broadcast of Last Call with Carson Daly, guests Neil Goldman, Taran Killam and Paul Campbell called NBC president Kevin Reilly on air, who seemed to confirm an interest in the series. He later recanted, but a deal was struck to produce webisodes.  Webisodes of varying length were released until January 12, 2007. In an interview with TV Squad, Lawrence divulged that NBC would broadcast a live TV special in March 2007. However in February 2007, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that the executive producer Bill Lawrence had voiced concerns that the show would not be broadcast and this was eventually confirmed by an NBC spokesperson who said, ""The project is not going forward."" Lawrence also said that the actors' contracts would expire at the end of February. There has been no live TV special as of December 2017.
""Derrick"" and ""Will"" have been extras on other NBC produced series such as Days of Our Lives and Scrubs.


== Plot ==
The show is about two friends from Union, Ohio, named Derrick (Taran Killam) and Will (Paul Campbell), who send a home video to every network, claiming they can produce a better sitcom than the ones currently being broadcast. The WB takes them up on this offer. Derrick and Will are taken to The WB studios, where they meet the head of The WB, Jeff Tucker (Paul Adelstein), Creative VP Roy Ingold (Bob Clendenin), and Tucker's assistant, whom he introduces as Jill Something (Lauren Bittner). Tucker tells them to create their own sitcom, while working in various sitcom-related sets. In addition, a reality show will be made about their sitcom's birth. Thus, the pair has a camera crew following them around The WB studios, when they are not on the sets, and a live studio audience, when they are working on the sets.
After setting the scene, the rest of the episode focuses on Derrick and Will's first day trying to come up with a sitcom. Over the course of the episode, they hire Jill Something as their assistant and make a pity-hire of Mandy (Mircea Monroe), who had just been fired from The WB gift shop. Meanwhile, Tucker and Ingold interfere by trying to introduce narrative conflicts into the show. Tucker tells Derrick he would rather continue the show without Will and demands that Mandy kiss Will, even though she prefers Derrick.
The title of the show is explained in the last scene: the cast is hanging out in the sitcom set, with the live audience reacting as if it is an actual show, which Mandy thinks is weird but is told to just pretend that ""nobody's watching"". Will says that ""nobody's watching"" is a perfect name for the sitcom they are developing (thus, Nobody's Watching is the name of the fake sitcom in the fake reality television show, Nobody's Watching). Derrick protests that ""nobody's watching"" is a terrible name, because critics will constantly ridicule them with comments like ""nobody's watching Nobody's Watching!"" He declares that it would be insane to name a television show that. This is immediately followed by the announcer saying ""Next week, on Nobody's Watching!...""

Fender Bronco Amp,"The Fender Bronco was a guitar amplifier made by Fender. It was the first Silverface amplifier introduced in 1967 to sport the modern-looking ""tailless"" Fender amp decal, which became a standard feature on other Fender amplifiers in the early 1970s. The Bronco was a student amp to go with the matching Bronco guitar. Bronco amplifiers were shipped as a part of the Bronco ""student"" package offered during that time, which also included the matching Bronco guitar, introduced that same year.  Some early Broncos used the early-mid 1960s ""tailed"" amp logo. The schematics and manuals listed the Bronco and the Vibro Champ as the same amp, except for the red letters and labels stamped on the control faceplate (Vibro Champs have blue labels and lettering like the rest of the Silverface amplifier models). The controls were also the same. It was discontinued in 1975.


== Technical information ==
Fender has recently released an amplifier bearing the name ""Bronco"" but it has little resemblance to the original version beyond using a 10-inch-diameter (250 mm) speaker. The new Bronco is a completely solid state amplifier using integrated circuits to control both the preamp section as well as power amp section of the amplifier. Solid state diodes are used to rectify the input AC mains electricity going into the amp to DC. Current production Fender Bronco amplifiers use no tubes and are housed in a tweed style cabinet constructed of medium density fiberboard and covered in a diagonal tweed fabric similar in appearance to amplifiers produced by Fender in the late 1950s. New production Broncos have the controls mounted on the top-rear of the amplifier unlike the original 'Silverface' Bronco.
The original Fender Bronco uses an all-tube AB764 circuit featuring a 12AX7 dual-triode preamp tube utilizing both sections of the tube in the preamp section of the amp. A second 12AX7 tube is used for driving the vibrato function. The power tube in the original Bronco is the 6V6GTA power tube, often used by Fender in its tube amps of the era. This amp's circuitry design is commonly known as a 'single-ended, class A' amplifier. Rectification in the original Bronco is via a single 5Y3GT rectifier tube, used by Fender since the early 1950s. In fact, Fender used an earlier version of this rectifier tube in the 1940s (the 5Y3) before it was phased out by manufacturers in the early 1950s to be replaced by the more electrically robust 5Y3GT.

Sakalovapalo burial mounds,"Sakalovapalo burial mounds is an ancient burial ground, a cemetery in Obinitsa village, Setomaa Parish, Võru County in southeastern Estonia.
A stone cross used to be located near the burial mounds and the place was important and well known for the people in the region. The stone cross was destroyed during Soviet rule; many other burial mounds were also destroyed during the same period, as the sand from the mound was used on the roads nearby for antiskid treatment. The cross was a donation place, where passersby brought money, buttons, strings of yarn and other things. Red and white ribbons were tied to the bushes near the cross. People in the former times thought that the mounds date back to the Great Northern War or Swedish Rule and told stories of great battles in connection with the mounds. The mounds have been examined in different times by different archaeologists. In 1913, the excavations were done by Russian geologist V. Kreiton. K. Mark, E. Astel, E. Richter, J. Linnus and many others have also done excavations in the mounds. The cemetery might have initially had up to 50 sand mounds. 36 of them have been preserved, 8 of which are extended mounds and 28 are round mounds. The mounds are so far the oldest archaeological relics in Obinitsa area.


== Legends ==
According to one legend, it is a Swedish cemetery, dating back to the Great Northern War (1700-1721). Round mounds are said to be the burial places for horses and the oval ones for people. To commemorate the dead, a large stone cross was placed there. At one point, the cross was taken to Taelova, but on the way, horses began to bolt and pull back, so the cross was taken back to its place. Another story is that gold has been buried near Sakalovapalo mounds and it is supposed to be in the place where one can see Saalesa or Saatse church domes. Battles of the Great Northern War were said to have lasted long in Obinitsa region, where Russian general Sokolovski (Sakalov in Seto language) is said to have fallen. His grave is said to have been in the area of the mounds and a large stone cross was put on the grave and attached to a growing pine by a chain.
In addition, the people in the former times told about an essütaja (a magical spirit, who leads people astray in the forests) who lived in the Sakalova heathy pine forest.

Simpson Investment Company,"The Simpson Investment Company is a company based in McCleary, Washington in the US Pacific Northwest that specializes in manufacture of forest products. Founded as a logging company in 1890 by Sol Simpson, the company now functions as a holding company for the Simpson Door Company, a manufacturer of wood doors.
Simpson announced in 2008 that it will be entering the ""green power"" industry by building a new power plant at its Tacoma Tideflats mill that will generate power via the burning of sawmill and other forest waste. In August 2009, construction of the power plant was completed. It generates 55 megawatts of power which is sold to Iberdrola Renovables and used by the Sacramento Municipal Utility District. The company is owned by the Reed family. William G. Reed Jr is a chairman on the board.


== Divisions ==
The company was split into two units in 2006. The Green Diamond Resource Company is a spinoff that was created to manage Simpson's forest lands. Both companies are owned by the same shareholders and as with the current subsidiaries, function as separate departments within a large company rather than as completely independent companies. After the split, the three operating subsidiaries of Simpson Investment Company are Simpson Timber Company, Simpson Paper Company, and Simpson Door Company.


== Former divisions ==
The Simpson Lumber Company conducted logging operations and was based in Shelton, Washington. Four mills were sold to Interfor and the Shelton property was sold to Sierra Pacific Industries.The ""Simpson Tacoma Kraft Company"" produced pulpwood and linerboard products. Previously owned by St. Regis Corporation, the mill was acquired by Simpson in 1985 and sold to RockTenn in 2014.


=== California ===
Simpson was a prominent forest products company in Northern California for much of the 20th century, after first acquiring California timberland in 1945, eventually managing more than 450,000 acres of forest in California, in what was then known as the Redwood Division and is now mostly part of spinoff Green Diamond Resource Company. Simpson was most prominent in Humboldt County, with Simpson Timber operating lumber mills in Korbel, Brainard, Orick, and Klamath, and Simpson Paper operating pulp and paper mills in Samoa and Eureka. Significant portions of the original 1968 Redwood National and State Parks and its 1977 expansion were former Simpson Timber Company land. Simpson Timber also ran the Arcata and Mad River Railroad for over 30 years.


=== Railroad ===
The Simpson Company built and operated a logging railroad known as the Simpson Railroad. When it closed in July 2015 it was the last logging railroad operations in the continental United States, and dates back 120 years. The railroad was once extensive and branched out into several hundred miles of forestland in the Olympic Peninsula but at the end was limited to just ten miles of operational track. The rail line was to transport lumber and as a transportation network to remote logging camps and towns. Construction of the railroad line was an engineering feat as demonstrated by the large and complex bridges built to span gorges and the mountainous terrain the railroad traveled through. The Vance Creek Bridge and the High Steel Bridge were built in 1929 and used until 1985 when the line was abandoned. The Vance Creek Bridge still stands, and the High Steel Bridge is still in use as a forest road. The High Steel Bridge is one of the tallest rail bridges in the United States and has been listed in the National Register of Historic Places.In January 2019, Green Diamond Resources leased the railroad's remaining 10 miles, plus sidings, to the Peninsular Railway and Lumbermen's Museum, a locally based 501(c)3 non-profit organization.  The all-volunteer group is advancing plans to operate several Simpson locomotives and other rolling stock for tourist trains designed to highlight the significant role lumbering and the railroad played in developing the economies of the local area, the Olympic Peninsula, and the entire Pacific Northwest.  The name “Simpson Railroad” and associated graphics and logos have been licensed by Simpson for the museum's use. During the summer months portions of the track are also used for pedal car tours by the Vance Creek Railriders.

== Career ==


=== Political beginnings ===
In 1987 he joined the Revolutionary Juvenile Front of the PRI party. From September 16, 2005, to March 31, 2009, he was Secretary of Finance, Planning and Administration in the State of Mexico Government. 
Between 2008 and 2009 he became National Coordinator of the states’ Finance Secretaries.

=== Finance Secretary of the State of Mexico ===
On September 15, 2005, when Enrique Peña Nieto was sworn in as constitutional governor of the State of Mexico, Luis Videgaray was named Secretary of Finance, Planning and Management, position he had for four years. In his own words, the three columns of his administration were “more investment capacity to generate more resources, strong finances and modernization of the administration”.
During this period, several actions of fiscal discipline and modernization of the public sector were executed. The credit score improved and for the first time, this entity obtained an investment rank. The state's income increased more than 150% by expanding the contributor's base and making more efficient the taxes collection process.
Additionally, the state's debt of 25,000 million pesos was refinanced in order to be paid in a 25-year term with an interest rate 30% lower. Another transaction in the same period—IDEAL's $700 million toll road ABS—obtained recognition in the Latin Finance magazine for the “2008 Deal of the Year"" inaugurating the ""Best Sub-Sovereign Financing” category. Also, the state developed one of the country's most complete legal frameworks for providing services and the country's first project under this guidance were executed.


=== Federal Deputy ===
In 2009, he was elected Federal Deputy under the principle of proportional representation as part of the LXI Legislature of Mexico's Congress. As such he served as president of the Budget and Public Accounts Committee. He held this legislative seat until March 29, 2011, when he requested a leave of absence to serve as political campaign coordinator for the then candidate for Governor of the State of Mexico, Eruviel Ávila. Among the proposals approved during his tenure as congressman in the Chamber of Deputies, were:
Enactment of the Law of Solidarity Support for Older Adults in Rural Areas presented in 2010.
Reform and additions initiative to the General Law of Persons with Disabilities of 2010.
Reform initiative to the Federal Budget and Fiscal Responsibility Law of 2011.


=== Campaign coordinator of Eruviel Ávila ===
Luis Videgaray requested a leave of absence from his seat in Congress in 2011, to coordinate Eruviel Ávila's campaign for governor of the State of Mexico. At the same time, he served as president of the State Steering Committee of the PRI. Eruviel Ávila won the state elections held on July 3, 2011 with 61.47% of the vote, followed by Alejandro Encinas Rodríguez of the PRD with 21.6%, results that were ratified by the electoral authorities despite the challenges entered by the opposition against said results. Videgaray led the campaign until its culmination in the elections of July 3, 2012, which resulted in Enrique Peña Nieto being formally declared president-elect of Mexico on 31 August 2012.


=== Campaign coordinator of Enrique Peña Nieto ===
After Eruviel Ávila became governor of the State of Mexico, Luis Videgaray was appointed on December 14, 2011 by Enrique Peña Nieto as his campaign coordinator for the 2012 presidential elections. During the development of that campaign, which began on October 30, 2011 of March 2012, Videgaray was related to the so-called ""Monex Case"" in which the local banking institution called Monex was allegedly used to buy votes by issuing cash cards that were distributed to targeted sectors of the population. However, the accusations in the case were dismissed as unfounded by the Federal Electoral Institute (today the National Electoral Institute), and Videgaray declared his party would abide by the decision of the electoral watchdog.


=== Transition Coordinator ===
A few days after Peña Nieto's victory in the presidential elections, he formed a team that would carry out the rapprochement with the different political forces of the country and the preparation towards his inauguration as President. This team was formed by Luis Videgaray, Miguel Ángel Osorio Chong and Jesús Murillo Karam, the first of them as head of ""public policies"", the second as coordinator of ""dialogue and political agreement"" and the third as coordinator of ""legal affairs"".After that, in September of that year, the president-elect formed a new team of 45 people with aims to easing the transition from the administration of Felipe Calderón Hinojosa to the new government, which would take office on 1 December 2012. Luis Videgaray was appointed as chief coordinator of the team.In this role, he was a key figure in the process leading to important political agreements, known as the Pact for Mexico (Pacto por México). Along with Miguel Osorio, he led the transition team and the Institutional Revolutionary Party at the various meetings where discussions took place with Gustavo Madero and Santiago Creel representing the National Action Party, and Jesús Ortega and Jesús Zambrano for the Party of the Democratic Revolution.


=== Minister of Finance and Public Credit ===
Videgaray was appointed Minister of Finance and Public Credit at the start of Peña Nieto's term. In the position, he was one of the promoters of the economic reforms of the government of Peña Nieto. Such is the case of the Financial Reform proposed to the Congress of the Union on April 16, 2013, which was promulgated on January 9, 2014, and the Energy Reform, enacted on 20 December 2013. At the end of Juanyary 2014 Videgaray was named by the London-based magazine The Banker as ""Secretary of Finance of the Year"" both globally and in Latin America.Alongside having a track record of spearheading contentious economic and financial reforms, Videgaray Caso was unable to avoid the political fallout of  Enrique Peña Nieto's meeting with Donald Trump, whilst the latter was still the 2016 Republican presidential candidate. A week after the meeting, Videgaray announced his resignation on September 7, 2016. Following much controversy, the Mexican government revealed that the idea to meet with Trump originated from Videgaray Caso.


=== Minister of Foreign Affairs ===
On January 4, 2017, before the January 20 inauguration of U.S. President Donald J. Trump, Videgaray Caso was appointed Secretary (Minister) of Foreign Affairs by President Peña Nieto. With a weakened peso versus the dollar since the U.S. election and good relations with the incoming U.S. President facilitated in 2016 through Jared Kushner, Videgaray's appointment was deemed by one U.S. publication as ""jarring to many in Mexico."" The secretary, in his first speech in the position, though, said he would choose neither ""a strategy of conflict, confrontations, and even insult, ... [or] a shameful submission."" Instead, he said, Mexico would pursue a course of ""intelligence and dignity, opening the doors to dialogue."" Upon his new appointment Videgaray also addressed a major subject of the Trump campaign - a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border which Mexico would pay for - stating about the payment ""there's no way that could happen."" Other issues to be addressed in this context with Mexico's northern neighbor are NAFTA and U.S.-owned manufacturing plants in Mexico. On February 9, 2017, CBS News reported that Mexican officials said Videgaray, with Jared Kushner, helped to rewrite portions of Trump's speech about the U.S.-Mexico border wall, although the White House denied that assertion.As Foreign Secretary Videgaray also maintained an active participation in the negotiation process between the Venezuelan opposition and the government of Nicolas Maduro. On the multilateral scenario, Videgaray signed, on behalf of the Government of Mexico, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, the first document of its kind.Under his watch as Secretary of Foreign Relations, Luis Videgaray revamped the law of the Mexican Foreign Service, updating its main provisions regarding tenure, evaluation and benefits, an initiative that was approved unanimously by both chambers of the Mexican Congress.On May 11, 2021 Luis Videgaray was sanctioned with a disqualification to take any public role in Mexico for ten years (in Spanish: inhabilitación) by Secretariat of the Civil Service. Videgaray was accused of not declaring his personal assets for three years.

"Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring","""Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring"" is the popular English title of the chorale from the 1723 Advent cantata Herz und Mund und Tat und Leben (Heart and Mouth and Deed and Life), BWV 147, by Johann Sebastian Bach. The chorale occurs twice in the cantata, with different texts each time (neither of which matches the English): as its sixth movement, Wohl mir, dass ich Jesum habe (Blessed Am I That Have Jesus), and again as its tenth movement, Jesus bleibet meine Freude (Jesus Remains My Joy). The English title derives from famous piano transcriptions made by Myra Hess, in 1926 for piano solo and in 1934 for piano duet, as published by Oxford University Press. Whether played instrumentally or sung in German or English, the chorale is often heard at weddings and during Advent, Christmas, and Easter.


== Background ==
Bach composed a four-part setting with independent orchestral accompaniment of two stanzas of the hymn Jesu, meiner Seelen Wonne, which had been written by Martin Janus in 1661 and was commonly sung to a Johann Schop melody, Werde munter, mein Gemüthe.


== Structure and scoring ==
Herz und Mund und Tat und Leben has ten movements and is in two parts, with the chorale concluding each part. Bach scored it for choir, trumpet, violin, and basso continuo, with optional parts for oboe and viola.


== Instrumental arrangements ==
The music's wide popularity has led to numerous arrangements and transcriptions, such as for the classical guitar and, in Wendy Carlos' album Switched-On Bach, on the Moog synthesizer. According to The New Oxford Companion to Music, the best-known transcriptions for piano are those by Hess.


== Text ==


=== English text ===
The following is a version with words attributed to the poet laureate Robert Bridges. It is not a translation of the stanzas used within Bach's original version, but is inspired by stanzas of the same hymn that Bach had drawn upon: ""Jesu, meiner Seelen Wonne"", the lyrics of which were written in 1661 by Martin Janus (or Jahn), and which was sung to Johann Schop's 1642 ""Werde munter, mein Gemüte"" hymn tune.


=== Original text ===
Jahn's verses express a close, friendly, and familiar friendship with Jesus, who gives life to the poet. It has been noted that the original German hymn was characteristically a lively hymn of praise, which is carried over somewhat into Bach's arrangement; whereas a slower, more stately tempo is traditionally used with the English version.


== Modern adaptations ==
The melody and other elements have been used in several pop and classical crossover recordings:

""Someone I Know"", on Margo Guryan's 1968 album Take a Picture
""Wicked Annabella"", a 1968 track on The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society, with Bach in Pete Quaife's bassline
Included as the coda of ""Cherry Blossom Clinic Revisited"", on The Move's 1970 album Shazam
""Joy"", a 1972 instrumental by Apollo 100, which reached number six on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and number 24 in the RPM Canadian chart
""Lady Lynda"", a 1979 single by The Beach Boys which reached the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart
""Joy"", an instrumental track on George Winston's 1982 album December, inspired by an arrangement by guitarist David Qualey
""Dormi dormi"", a 2019 track on the extended album Sì by Andrea Bocelli, a lullaby inspired by the chorale, sung by Bocelli and Jennifer Garner in Italian and English

Ambras Castle,"Ambras Castle (German: Schloss Ambras Innsbruck) is a Renaissance castle and palace located in the hills above Innsbruck, Austria. Ambras Castle is 632 metres (2,073 ft) above sea level. Considered one of the most popular tourist attractions of the Tyrol, Ambras Castle was built in the 16th century on the spot of an earlier 10th-century castle, which became the seat of power for the Counts of Andechs. The cultural and historical importance of the castle is closely connected with Archduke Ferdinand II (1529–1595) and served as his family's residence from 1567 to 1595. Ferdinand was one of history's most prominent collectors of art. The princely sovereign of Tyrol, son of Emperor Ferdinand I, ordered that the medieval fortress at Ambras be turned into a Renaissance castle as a gift for his wife Philippine Welser.  The cultured humanist from the House of Habsburg accommodated his world-famous collections in a museum: the collections, still in the Lower Castle built specifically for that museum's purpose, make Castle Ambras Innsbruck one of the oldest museums in the world.
The Lower Castle contains armouries that feature masterpieces of the European armourers' art from the time of Emperor Maximilian I to Emperor Leopold I. As the only Renaissance Kunstkammer of its kind to have been preserved at its original location, the ""Kunst- und Wunderkammer"" (Chamber of Art and Wonders) represents an unrivalled cultural monument.
Above the Lower Castle is the famous Spanish Hall (Spanischer Saal), a notable example of German Renaissance architecture, which contains an intricate wood-inlay ceiling and walls adorned with 27 full-length portraits of the rulers of Tyrol. The Upper Castle contains the extensive Habsburg Portrait gallery (Habsburger Porträtgalerie) featuring paintings of numerous members of the House of Austria and other leading ruling European dynasties, including, as a remarkable feature, many portraits of princely children.


== History ==
Long before Innsbruck became a city, references to an Amras or Omras appeared in documents dating from the 10th century. This early fortification in what was then the southwest corner of Bavaria was the seat of power of the Counts of Andechs, who became Margraves of Istria and later Dukes of the short-lived Imperial State of Merania from 1180 to 1248. This original fortification was destroyed in 1133 and no traces of it remain, although some of the material from the original structure was later used in the modern building. In 1248, the castle ruins and property passed by inheritance from the Counts of Andechs to Count Albert IV of Tyrol.

The modern Ambras Castle was built by Archduke Ferdinand II (1529–1595), the second son of Emperor Ferdinand I. When he was made provincial sovereign of Tyrol in 1564, Ferdinand II ordered two Italian architects to turn the existing medieval fortress into a Renaissance castle for his untitled wife Philippine Welser (1527–1580), whom he had married in secret. Ferdinand II prepared his family's residence in the Upper Castle, beneath which he constructed one of the most artistically important halls of the late Renaissance—known as the ""Spanish Hall"" since the nineteenth century. In 1567, Ferdinand II  made his entry into Innsbruck, prior to that, he was appointed administrating governor to the Kingdom of Bohemia, taking up residence in Prague in 1547. In 1589, he added an additional building, the Heldenrüstkammer, west of the Lower Castle for the purpose of housing his collection of ""Heroes"", the very first systematic presentation of objects in the history of museums. Ambras Castle was used as the residence of Philippine as well as a place for Ferdinand II to house his collection of weapons, suits of armour, portraits, natural objects, as well as rarities and precious objects. Today, the art history museum Schloss Ambras Innsbruck Archived 2019-03-29 at the Wayback Machine is part of the Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna.
Philippine became a popular and beloved figure through her charity and willingness to help others, particularly the common people of Tyrol. Even the nobility brought their petitions to the former commoner. As signs of affection, people addressed their written petitions to ""Merciful Miss"" or ""serene Princess Mrs. Philippine of Austria"". After Ferdinand's death in 1595, the second son of Ferdinand and Philippine, Margrave Charles of Burgau, inherited Ambras Castle. With little interest in preserving the castle or its collections, they fell into a state of dilapidation and Charles sold them in 1606 to Emperor Rudolf II. The emperor residing in Prague left his uncle's collection nearly in its entirety at Ambras Castle, as he himself was one of the most important Habsburg collectors.

In the following years, Ambras Castle no longer had the status of an official residence and was seldom lived in. Inadequate preservation measures led to the loss of valuable books, manuscripts, and hand sketches, and soon the palace fell largely into disrepair. In the seventeenth century, Emperor Leopold I (1640–1705) had some of the most valuable holdings of the Ambras collections—mostly books and manuscripts—moved to Vienna, where they can still be seen at the Austrian National Library. In 1805, the remaining Ambras collections were threatened by the defeat of Austria by the French Empire. Fortunately, after he recognized the private-law character of the Ambras collection, Napoleon (1769–1821) had it brought to safety in Vienna.In 1855, Archduke Karl Ludwig, then governor of Tyrol, had the palace remodeled to use as a summer residence. Significant changes were made during this time to the palace and the surrounding park. The Outer Bailey (Vorschloss) was constructed with an ivy-clad entrance ramp for carriages. The park was redesigned as an English garden. Following Archduke Karl Ludwig's renouncement of his succession rights in 1889, the palace fell once again into ruinous condition. In 1880, it was converted into a museum and subsequently renovated.In 1919, following the dissolution of the Austria-Hungary Empire, Ambras Castle became the property of the Republic of Austria. In 1950, the Kunsthistorisches Museum took over the administration of the castle and its collections. Throughout the 1970s, a comprehensive restoration took place of the Spanish Hall, the Upper Castle residential quarters, and the inner courtyard. In 1974, the Chamber of Art and Wonders was completed. In 1976, the Habsburg Portrait Gallery covering the fifteenth to nineteenth centuries was completed. In 1981, the Armouries was reopened in the Lower Castle.


== Collections ==
Schloss Ambras Innsbruck is a federal museum of the Republic of Austria. It is administratively part of the Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna and belongs to the KHM-Museumsverband.
Ferdinand II was one of the most important patrons of the Habsburg family. He founded the notable collections of Ambras and had a museum built for them in the rooms of the ""Lower Castle"", which was constructed according to the most advanced ideas of his time. The three Armouries and the Chamber of Art and Wonders were designed and used as a museum from the beginning.


=== Spanish Hall ===
The Spanish Hall, built between 1569 and 1572, is one of the most important freestanding halls of the Renaissance. The picturesque lay-out of the 43-metre (141 ft) long hall is dominated by the 27 full-length portraits of the princely rulers of the Tyrol. Today rather famous classical concerts take place in this hall.


=== Chamber of Art and Wonders ===

The Chamber of Art and Wonders of Archduke Ferdinand II is the only Renaissance Kunstkammer which can still be seen in its original place. Others had been plundered like the ones in Munich, Prague or Stuttgart, or their character had been changed like in Dresden or Kassel.
In the Chamber of Art and Wonders at Ambras Castle artificialia, naturalia, scientifica, exotica, and mirabilia are to be seen: natural wonders (rare, unique and excellent things of nature) as well as precious objects, scientific items, toys, or luxury items of the time, and so on.  In contents the natural and artistic objects represent the programme of the late Renaissance encyclopedic collections. The special thing about the Ambras-collections is, that they are still where they were meant to be seen. Still you can find corals arranged in cabinet-boxes, turnery made of wood or ivory, glass figures, or porcelain and silk paintings which belong to the oldest European collections of Asian, African and American art (exotica).
Also important works of European artists, like the carved ""little death"" made of wood by Hans Leinberger can be found, as well as typical Kunstkammer - objects like handstones, goblets made of rhinoceros horn, coconut or rock crystal, animals made of bronze, music- and measuring instruments, automats and clocks. A very important part of the collection were portraits of wondrous persons like the hairy people, Vlad Dracula  and others.


=== Armouries ===
Archduke Ferdinand II's idea of a museum was a novelty: he systematically collected armour from famous personalities of his time. He presented this armour ""to the eternal memory"" of that persons - mostly military commanders - in the ""Heldenrüstkammer"" (Heroes' Armoury); some on display today still in the original 16th century showcases.  His ""Rüstkammern"" (Armouries) contain very rare examples of arms and armour from the 15th century which originally came from the collections of Emperor Maximilian I and Archduke Sigismund. Armour for tournaments like the German joust or the German course, and the armour of the court's giant Bartlmä Bon, who took part in the tournament in Vienna in 1560, can be seen. The ""Leibrüstkammer"" (Court Armoury) includes the archduke's private armour and the armour of the court of Innsbruck. Ferdinand's collection of armour was one of the most important of its kind, not only because of the collection idea, but also because of the quality and quantity of his objects. Today, selected objects still illustrate the museum idea  in Innsbruck at Ambras Castle, whereas many of the armour is exhibited at the Hofjagd- und Rüstkammer (Imperial Armoury) of the Kusthistorisches Museum, Vienna.


=== Upper Castle ===
The Upper Castle, the oldest part of Ambras Castle, contains the Habsburg Portrait Gallery. About 300 portraits from the 15th to the 19th century, including King Albrecht II, Emperor Maximilian I, Charles V and Ferdinand I, to the last emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, Franz II, a contemporary of Napoleon Bonaparte. Because of the various dynastic relations, the collection also shows members of other European dynasties. The portraits were painted by well-known artists such as Lucas Cranach the Elder, Antonis Mor, Titian, Anthony van Dyck and Diego Velázquez.
The Strasser Collection of Glass is amongst the most important of its kind in the world. Built up by Professor Rudolf Strasser over a period of more than fifty years this collection includes valuable Renaissance and Baroque Period glasses from Europe's most important glass producing regions, for example Venice, Bohemia, Hall, Innsbruck and Silesia. The high quality of the collection is quite comparable with the collection of these epochs in the Corning Museum of Glass.The Collection of Gothic Sculpture presents objects date from the time of Emperor Maximilian I (1459–1519). The main work is the imposing St George altar-piece which was made by Sebold Bocksdorfer commissioned by Maximilian and important for the Habsburg's Order of Saint George.
The Inner Courtyard, decorated between 1564 and 1567 with grisaille painting al fresco (grey painting on still-wet plaster), is among the best-preserved examples of fresco from the sixteenth century. The representations of princely virtues and muses, female and male heroes, and diverse heroic acts sought to display the royalty as exemplary. They relate to their commissioner Archduke Ferdinand II, patron of the arts and host of lavish festivities.
In cultural historical terms the Bathing Chambers of Philippine Welser, the only bath of the 16th century completely preserved, is something of a cultural heritage.
The Chapel is dedicated to St. Nicholas. Consecrated for the first time in 1330 and often rebuilt over the centuries, it was finally painted in the 19th century by the Innsbruck painter August Wörndle.


== Ambras Castle silver coin ==
Ambras Castle is so popular and well known, that it was the subject of one of the best known famous silver collectors' coins: the 10 euro Ambras Castle coin.
On the obverse of the coin there is a general view of the castle to the south of Innsbruck with its Renaissance style gardens forms the central design. On the reverse, three court musicians cross the floor of the Spanish Hall, based on a picture from 1569. This design recalls the court festivals for which Fedinand II had the Spanish Hall specially constructed.

Gary Lenaire,"Gary Lenaire (born July 29, 1967) is an American musician who primarily performs thrash metal and speed metal. Lenaire is best known for his work in Tourniquet, though later he began to work for BOSS amps and interviewed musicians, including Steve Vai, Marty Friedman, John 5, and Rudy Sarzo. Lenaire was nominated for six GMA Awards, and received Heaven's Metal Magazine's ""guitarist of the year"" award between 1994 and 1996.


== History ==
Lenaire began performing music prior to 1985, performing with Guy Ritter. The two went on to start Holy Danger, a Christian heavy metal band which lasted a year, though the band recorded a full-length titled One Way. In 1989, Lenaire and Ritter formed a new band called Tourniquet, hiring on former Trouble drummer Ted Kirkpatrick. The band released their first album, Stop the Bleeding, through Intense Records, with the album being produced by Bill Metoyer (Slayer, Cattle Decapitation). The three hired on Erik Mendez on guitars and Victor Macias on bass and the band would then perform as a five-piece. Over the years, Lenaire recorded on the records Psychosurgery, Pathogenic Ocular Dissonance, Vanishing Lessons, Carry the Wounded EP, and Collected Works
In 1996, Lenaire departed from Tourniquet. According to Mendez, he believed that Lenaire had a falling out with Kirkpatrick, as well as vocalist-at-the-time Luke Easter, which led to his departure. Lenaire went on to form Echo Hollow alongside Ritter. With Echo Hollow, Lenaire recorded on both albums, titled Diet of Worms and Superficial Intelligence. In 2004, Echo Hollow disbanded, with Lenaire going to form Cripple Need Cane. In 2005, with Cripple Need Cane, Lenaire recorded and released The Big Dance. In 2006, Lenaire reconnected  with his former Tourniquet bandmates Mendez and Macias, repairing any bad blood there was between them, and created the project known as 2050. The band, while never having released a full length album, have recorded two songs, including ""Darfur"" and ""In Remission"". A long gap between his musical career occurred, however, this allowed Lenaire to write a book, titled Infidel Manifesto: Why Sincere Believers Lose Faith, which documents Lenaire's leaving of the Christian faith. According to his bandmate, Mendez, Lenaire is agnostic and is ""still searching"". In 2017, he recorded his debut solo release, titled No Time Now, which featured Bubby Lewis (Snoop Dogg, Suicidal Tendencies), Anna Sentina, Neil Swanson (Ritchie Sambora and Orianthi), Aly Frank, Andrijana Janevska, and Ritter. Lenaire later released a single with Easter on vocals. In early 2020, Lenaire released his second solo release, which was titled Symphonic Liberties, which saw a departure from the typical metal releases Lenaire was known for, moving into classical music territories. Later on that year, Lenaire announced a third solo album, which featured his former bandmates, Ritter, Easter, and Mendez - with hopes that Macias would return - to record a thrash metal album similar to Tourniquet. Lenaire also hired David Husvik of Extol, Azusa, and Mantric fame to record drums for the album. The band would later announce their name as FLOOD, with the assistance of Michael Sweet of Stryper. The full lineup consists of Lenaire on guitars and vocals, Guy Ritter on vocals, Erik Mendez on guitars, David Husvik on drums, and Anna Sentina on bass.

Husum–Bad St. Peter-Ording railway,"The Husum-Bad Sankt Peter-Ording railway (also known as the Eiderstedt line) is a 44 km-long, single-track non-electrified branch line in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein. The line connects the North Frisian town of Husum with all the important parts of the Eiderstedt peninsula, including Tönning, Garding and Sankt Peter-Ording. The line opened in 1854 and was one of the oldest railways in Germany.
Passenger trains are operated by the DB Regio Schleswig-Holstein at hourly intervals.


== Route ==
The first section of the line from Husum station follows the Marsh Railway to Horn junction. The line passes through the flat and largely agricultural marsh land of Eiderstedt. The section of the line to Bad St. Peter-Ording branches off to the south just before Tönning station, which is a terminus where trains have to reverse to in order to continue their journey. The station acts as a passing place where trains cross each other hourly.
The only engineering works on the line after Tönning station are some bridges that are built above sluice gates for drainage and a floodgate in a dike that can be closed during storm surges near St. Peter-Ort. The only station between St. Peter-Ort and Tönning with a significant entrance building is at Katharinenheerd station.
Some stations are a significant distance to the villages they serve, including Kating and Witzwort.

The section from Tönning to Husum was opened in 1854 as part of the Tönning–Flensburg line built by the Flensburg–Husum–Tönning Railway Company (Flensburg-Husum-Tönninger Eisenbahngesellschaft). The westerly branch from Tönning was opened to Garding in 1892 and was extended to St. Peter-Ording in 1932.
Tönning is now built as a terminal station, which is rare in such a rural location. Originally, the line continued through the station to a port for loading cattle to the United Kingdom. The line and port were built for this purpose by the British firm of Sir Samuel Morton Peto, along with a similar railway port in Flensburg. Not long afterwards freight loaded at Tönning port to the UK was already limited. In 1878 the possibility was raised of opening a ferry from Tönning to Karolinenkoog over the Eider, which was connected to Heide by the Heide–Karolinenkoog line opened in 1877 and from there to Hamburg. On 1 June 1886 a ferry opened and the combination of rail and ferry briefly became the fastest way to reach Hamburg from Husum, since at that time, the Marsh Railway was not yet finished to Husum, although this extension opened on 1 September 1886.
The old line went to the east of the current Hörn junction on the route of the modern B 5 highway, passing to the west of Husum and went around a 180-degree turn from the north to Husum station. The line then continued to the east towards Flensburg on the route to Jübek.
In 1886 a connection was built between Platenhörn on the Husum–Tönning line and a junction at Hörn on a new extension of the Marsh Railway from Heide to Husum, which ran a little to the east of the Tönning line. In 1902, the old line between Husum and Platenhörn was dismantled. Today only a few property lines mark the old route.
The extension of the line from Garding to St. Peter-Ording was opened 78 years after the opening of the line to Tönning due to lack of finances. Previously, guests of the spa and tourists from the end of the line at Garding were transported in horse-drawn carriages and postbuses to the popular coastal resort with its wide sandy beach. After overnight stays in St. Peter-Ording greatly increased in the 1920s and 1930s, it was decided to extend the line. The residents of both St. Peter and Ording, which were then independent towns, jockeyed to have the station named after each town. The two towns finally realised that their interests were best served by naming the station Bad (“spa”) St. Peter-Ording; although the municipalities were only merged as Bad St. Peter-Ording in 1967. The next station down the line was in the locality of St. Peter Dorf (""St. Peter village""), which was considered to sound provincial, so the station was named Bad St. Peter Süd (south).


=== Post-war period and decline ===
The Bad St. Peter-Ording–Garding section of the line was closed in 1945 to war damage received during the Second World War. It returned to regular operations in 1947.
In the early days, the line was operated with steam trains, then with Deutsche Bundesbahn class V 36 diesel locomotives and red Donnerbüchse carriages. In the winter timetable of 1960 the line was converted to operate with Uerdingen railbuses (classes VT 95 and VT 98, ""piglet taxis""), with up to six carriages. Passenger services were later provided by battery-powered railcars.
Like many other local railways the Eiderstedt line ran downhill from the mid-1950s: gradually, passenger traffic declined, freight traffic was abandoned, rail tracks were dismantled and connection times in Husum deteriorated. Difficulties with baggage handling and the use of uneconomic train sets (DB Class V 100 with Silberling control cars) signalled a decline of the line.
Eventually a proposal for the total closure of the line was discussed, because the then cash-strapped Deutsche Bundesbahn was responsible for funding low volume lines. Therefore, Deutsche Bundesbahn submitted proposals to the Ministry of Transport in 1976 and around 1983 to close the line, leading to anger and criticism in the municipalities in the North Friesland district, which saw the line as vital for tourism. As a result of large protests, the federal government turned down the application to close the line.


=== Renaissance and new operators ===
As a result of pressure from the state of Schleswig-Holstein, the Deutsche Bundesbahn has invested in the line since the early 1990s. The introduction of regional fast trains (Regionalschnellbahnen) and hourly regular interval services with modern class DB-628 diesel multiple units transformed the line. The operation was thus more efficient, faster and more attractive. In 2000 the Nord-Ostsee-Bahn (NOB) service (now a subsidiary of Veolia Verkehr) won the tender with Alstom Coradia LINT and Bombardier Talent diesel multiple units. This company initiated consistent services from early morning to late evening and introduced Gleisradio (track radio), a special passenger information system using GPS. Some of the rail services operate via Husum, Schleswig and Rendsburg to Kiel. Since 2011 services on the line have been operated by DB Regio Schleswig-Holstein (formerly called Regionalbahn Schleswig-Holstein), a subsidiary of DB Regio.
The line is particularly important for tourism and is an important access to the North Sea resort of Bad St. Peter-Ording, but is also important for student and commuter traffic. Consequently, in the summer months 3,000 people use the line each day and about 1600 people per day use it in the winter.
The whole line is controlled using electromechanical signalling by the signalman at Tönning station. The eastern part of the line to Horn junction uses an adaptation of the electronic interlocking of Husum. The section from Tönning to Bad St. Peter-Ording is operated as a branch line using Automatic Block Signal.

Acacia obtriangularis,"Acacia obtriangularis, also commonly knowns as Lawley River wattle, is a shrub of the genus Acacia and the subgenus Plurinerves that is endemic to a small area of north western Australia.


== Description ==
The shrub typically grows to a height of 1.5 to 2 m (4 ft 11 in to 6 ft 7 in) and has an erect habit. The branchlets are covered with fine short hairs and have slender stipules that curve upward from the base and are 2 to 3 mm (0.079 to 0.118 in) in length. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The pungent and evergreen phyllodes have an inequilaterally obtriangular with a length of 3 to 5 mm (0.12 to 0.20 in) and a width of 2 to 3 mm (0.079 to 0.118 in) with six to eight often indistinct longitudinal nerves. It blooms around March or April producing yellow flowers.


== Taxonomy ==
The species was first formally described by the botanists Bruce Maslin, Matthew David Barrett and Russell Lindsay Barrett in 2013 as a part of the work A baker's dozen of new wattles highlights significant Acacia (Fabaceae: Mimosoideae) diversity and endemism in the north-west Kimberley region of Western Australia as published in the journal Nuytsia.
It is a part of the larger Acacia deltoidea group but is easily distinguished from other members by virtue of its spicate inflorescences and is most closely related to Acacia froggattii and Acacia vincentii.


== Distribution ==
It is native to a small area in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. It is found as part of a single population that covers an area of several square kilometres near the mouth of the Lawley River where it is found growing in sandy soils over sheets of sandstone.

Carlos Baliño,"Carlos Baliño (13 February 1848 – 18 June 1926) was a Cuban writer, revolutionary and one of the first proponents of Marxism in Cuba. 
He was born in Guanajay, Cuba.
His early writings were poetry and prose. By 1869 his writings had gained notability for their anti-colonial and pro-independence inclinations; thus placing him at odds with the colonial authorities. He was forced into exile and lived in New Orleans, Louisiana, where he studied architecture.
In 1892, while living in the United States he, along with Jose Marti, founded the Cuban Revolutionary Party.
In 1902, a year after the United States signed the Platt Amendment, Baliño returned to Cuba. While in Cuba he began to write more often, appearing in El Mundo and El Proletario, among other publications. In 1905 he published Bases Fundamentales (Principal Bases).
In his writings Baliño addressed the position of the proletariat, the question of political power and argued for the creation of a classless society based on the socialization of the means of production. From the early 1900s he gradually moved towards Marxism.
In 1906, he signed the charter of the Socialist Party of Cuba, which emerged from the consolidation of the Socialist Workers' Party and the International Socialist Group, also created with his contribution. Being a member of the Socialist Group of Havana, in 1910 he came to take his presidency replacing Ramón Belmonte, after the most prominent workers in the Havana Sewerage Strike were expelled from the country.
Baliño edited various Socialist newspapers and in 1925 was amongst the founders of the Communist Party of Cuba.
He was an early critic of neocolonialism and wrote the prologue and translation to Scott Nearing’s 1921 anti-imperialist work, The American Empire.

Methane clumped isotopes,"Methane clumped isotopes are methane molecules that contain two or more rare isotopes. Methane (CH4) contains two elements, carbon and hydrogen, each of which has two stable isotopes. For carbon, 98.9% are in the form of carbon-12 (12C) and 1.1% are carbon-13 (13C); while for hydrogen, 99.99% are in the form of protium (1H) and 0.01% are deuterium (2H or D). Carbon-13 (13C) and deuterium (2H or D) are rare isotopes in methane molecules. The abundance of the clumped isotopes provides information independent from the traditional carbon or hydrogen isotope composition of methane molecules.


== Introduction ==
Isotopologues are molecules that have the same chemical composition, but differ only in their isotopic composition. Methane has ten stable isotopologues: 12CH4, 13CH4, 12CH3D, 13CH3D, 12CH2D2, 13CH2D2, 12CHD3, 13CHD3, 12CD4 and 13CD4, among which, 12CH4 is an unsubstituted isotopologue; 13CH4 and 12CH3D are singly substituted isotopologues; 13CH3D and 12CH2D2 are doubly substituted isotopologues. The multiple-substituted isotopologues are clumped isotopologues.
The absolute abundance of each isotopologue primarily depends on the traditional carbon and hydrogen isotope compositions (δ13C and δD) of the molecules. Clumped isotope composition is calculated relative to the random distribution of carbon and hydrogen isotopes in the methane molecules. The deviations from the random distribution is the key signature of methane clumped isotope (please see ""notation"" for details).
In thermodynamic equilibrium, methane clumped isotopologue composition has a monotonic relationship with formation temperature. This is the condition for many geological environments so that methane clumped isotope can record its formation temperature, and therefore can be used to identify the origins of methane. When methane clumped-isotope composition is controlled by kinetic effects, for example, for microbial methane, it has the potential to be used to study metabolism.The study of methane clumped isotopologues is very recent. The first mass spectrometry measurement of methane clumped isotopologues of natural abundance was made in 2014. This is a very young and fast-growing field.

Assuming isotopes are randomly distributed throughout all isotopologues and isotopes are of natural abundance.


== Notation ==


=== Δ notation ===
The Δ notation of clumped isotopes is an analogue to δ notation of traditional isotopes (e.g. δ13C, δ18O, δ15N, δ34S and δD).

The Δ notation is inherited from traditional δ notation. But the reference is not a physical reference material. Instead, the reference frame is defined as the stochastic distribution of isotopologues in the sample. It means the values of Δ are to denote the excess or deficit of the isotopologue relative to the amount expected if a material conforms to the stochastic distribution.The calculation of stochastic distribution of methane isotopologues:

The two Δ formulas are frequently used to report the abundance of clumped isotopologues of methane.
The reason for choosing stochastic distribution as the reference frame may be historical - in the process of developing CO2 clumped isotope measurement, the only material with known clumped isotope abundance was CO2 heated to 1000 °C. However, this reference frame is a good choice. Because the absolute abundance of each isotopologue primarily depends on the bulk carbon and hydrogen isotope compositions (δ13C and δD) of the molecules, i.e. very close to stochastic distribution. Therefore, the deviation from the stochastic distribution, which is the key information embedded in the methane clumped isotopologues, is denoted by Δ values.


=== Mass-18 notation ===
Under some circumstances, the abundances of 13CH3D and 12CH2D2 isotopologues are only measured as a sum, which leads to the notation for isotopologues of mass-18 (i.e. 13CH3D and 12CH2D2):

=== Equilibrium thermodynamics ===
When formed or re-equilibrated in reversible reactions, methane molecules can exchange isotopes with each other or with other substances present, such as H2O, H2 and CO2, and reach internal isotopic equilibrium. As a result, clumped isotopologues are enriched relative to the stochastic distribution.

  , as in ""Notation""), which are non-linear polynomial functions of δD and δ13C values. Such non-linearity can be a diagnostic signature for mixing if multiple samples of various mixing ratios can be measured. When end-members have similar δ13C or δD compositions, the non-linearity is negligible.


== Measurement techniques ==


=== Mass spectrometry ===
On an isotope-ratio mass spectrometer, the measurement of clumped isotopologues has to be conducted on intact methane molecules, instead of converting methane to CO2, H2 or H2O. High mass resolution is required to distinguish different isotopologues of very close relative molecular mass (same ""cardinal mass"", e.g. 13CH4 and 12CH3D (17.03465 Da (daltons) versus 17.03758 Da), 13CH3D and 12CH2D2 (18.04093 Da versus 18.04385 Da). Currently, two commercial models capable of such measurement are Thermo Scientific 253 Ultra and the Panorama by Nu Instruments.


=== Infrared spectroscopy ===
Tunable infrared laser direct absorption spectroscopy (TILDAS) has been developed to measure the abundance of 13CH3D with two continuous wave quantum cascade lasers.


== Theoretical studies ==
There have been several theoretical studies on equilibrium thermodynamics of methane clumped isotopologues since 2008. These studies are based on ab initio, from underlying physical chemistry principles, and do not rely on empirical, or lab-based, data.
Ma et al. utilized first-principle quantum mechanism molecular calculation (Density Functional Theory, or DFT) to study the temperature dependence of the 13CH3D abundance. Cao and Liu estimated

    {\displaystyle 175\pm 47}
  °C), which aligns well with modeled results of methane formation temperature and yield. However, some thermogenic methane samples have clumped-isotope temperatures that are unrealistically high. Possible explanations for exceedingly high clumped isotope temperatures include natural gas migration after formation, mixing effect, and kinetic isotope effect of secondary cracking.


=== Biosphere ===
Methanogenesis is a form of anaerobic respiration used by microbes, and microbial methanogenesis can occur in deep subsurface, marine sediments, freshwater bodies, etc. It appears that methane from deep subsurface and marine sediment is generally in internal isotopic equilibrium., while freshwater microbial methanogenesis expresses large kinetic isotope effect on methane clumped isotope composition.There are two possible explanations for this variance: firstly, substrate limitation may enhance the reversibility of methanogenesis, thus allowing methane to achieve internal isotopic equilibrium via rapid hydrogen exchange with water; secondly, activation of C-H bonds during anaerobic oxidation precedes reversibly such that C-H bonds are broken and reformed faster than the net rate of methane consumption and methane can be reequilibrated.

   values of methane in internal isotopic equilibrium. As there are assumptions and approximations in calculations, the equilibrium distribution is only experimentally validated after the analysis of samples brought to thermodynamic equilibrium. Nickel and platinum catalysts have been used to equilibrate methane C-H bonds at various temperatures from 150 to 500 °C in laboratory. Currently, catalytic equilibration is also the practice to develop the reference material for clumped isotope analysis .


=== Microbial culture ===
Hydrogenotrophic methanogens utilize CO2 and H2 to produce methane by the following reaction:

CO2 + 4H2 → CH4 + 2H2OAcetoclastic methanogens metabolize acetate acid and produce methane:

CH3COOH → CH4 + CO2In laboratories, clumped isotope compositions of methane generated by hydrogenotrophic methanogens, acetoclastic methanogens (biodegradation of acetate), and methylotrophic methanogens are universally out of equilibria. It has been proposed that the reversibility of methanogenic enzyme is key to the kinetic isotope effect expressed in biogenic methane.

== Applications ==


=== Distinguishing origins of natural gas ===
Biogenic, thermogenic and abiotic methane is formed at different temperatures, which can be recorded in clumped isotope compositions of methane. Combined with conventional carbon and hydrogen isotope fingerprints and gas wetness (the abundance of low molecular weight hydrocarbon), methane clumped isotope can be used to identify the origins of methane in different types of natural gas accumulations.

Gran Teatro Nacional (Mexico),"The Great National Theatre of Mexico was a large opera house in Mexico City.


== Milestones in its history ==
The theatre was built between 1840 and 1844 by architect Lorenzo de la Hidalga in Mexico City. It was located at the end of Cinco de Mayo Ave., on Vergara Street (now Bolívar). It had a capacity of more than 3,500 people; that is to say, 1,500 more seats than the present-day Palacio de Bellas Artes.
Historians consider it the most important architectural work in Mexico City between the completion of the Metropolitan Cathedral and the building of the Palacio de Bellas Artes. The Great National Theatre was inaugurated in one of Antonio López de Santa Anna's terms as president. Its name changed successively, from Great Theatre of Santa Anna to Great Theatre Vergara, then Great Imperial Theatre, and finally Great National Theatre.
During the opera season of 1852, the theatre premiered 17 operas and offered more than 60 performances.


=== Great Imperial Theatre ===
During the Second Mexican Empire, by command of emperor Maximilian I of Mexico, the theatre changed its name to Great Imperial Theatre. During this period it was directed by Spanish playwright José Zorrilla.
In this period a scandal occurred relating to the opera Ildegonda by Melesio Morales, which premiered on 27 January 1866. When the opera was ready, a group of notables, including Don José Urbano Fonseca and Don José Ignacio Durán, went to see the impresario of the Great Imperial Theatre, Don Annibale Biacchi, so that Morales's opera could premiere there. Biacchi answered that he would not stage a work by a Mexican, which would damage his business.


=== Great National Theatre ===
After the death of the emperor Maximilian I of Mexico and the restoration of the Republic, the theatre was renamed Great National Theatre.
Around this time was the worldwide première of Cleopatra by Melesio Morales, writes Mañón:


=== Demolition ===
The Great National Theatre was demolished between 1900 and 1901 to extend the Avenida Cinco de Mayo. The demolition was justified with the promise that the theatre would be replaced by the Palacio de Bellas Artes, whose construction began in 1904, but was interrupted  by the Mexican Revolution, and finally opened in 1934.

Tifal language,"Tifal is an Ok language spoken  in Papua New Guinea. Dialects are (1) Tifal (Tifalmin) and Urap (Urapmin) and (2) Atbal (Atbalmin).


== Geography ==
The Tifal language is bounded by Papuan and Irian Jaya speakers to the south and west, the Telefomin valley in the east, and the Sepik river to the north.


== Orthography ==


== Phonology ==


=== Consonants ===
/b/ is realized as [pʰ] word finally, as [p] in syllable-coda position before a consonant, and [b] elsewhere.
/t/ is realized as [t] in syllable coda before a consonant and [tʰ] elsewhere.
/d/ is realized as [ɾ] intervocalically, e.g. /didab/: [dɪˈɾʌpʰ] 'water container'.
/k/ is [ɣ] intervocalically, [k] in syllable coda before consonants, and [kʰ] elsewhere.
/s/ is realized as [ʂ] before /u/.
/l/ is alveolar adjacent to back vowels and alveodental elsewhere. One dialect realizes /l/ as [r] intervocalically.


=== Vowels ===
/o/ and /oː/ rarely contrast.


=== Phonotactics ===
Syllable structure is (C)V(ː)(C). The expression kwiin takan 'oh my!' may be an exception.
/d/ only occurs word-initially. /f/ only occurs syllable-initially. /ŋ/ is always syllable-final.Initial /l/ only occurs in some dialects. Initial /kw/ occurs in two dialects, and may usually be interpreted as C+V.
/w/ and /j/ occur syllable-initially. Only one dialect allows syllable-coda /j/.


=== Stress ===
In inflected words stress lies on the last syllable of the verb stem. Otherwise, if there are long vowels stress falls on the first in the word. If all vowels are short, stress falls on the last syllable if it is closed and the first syllable otherwise.


== Grammar ==


=== Nouns ===
Nouns are not inflected but may mark possession. Body parts and kinship terms are obligatorily possessed, and some kinship terms require affixing. On other nouns possession is optional, except for proper names which are never possessed.


=== Pronouns ===


== Verbs ==
Tifal has a rich aspectual system. Verbs may be separated into four groups based on how they transform from continuative to punctiliar aspect. Some only have vowel and/or simple stem changes, some have suppletive stems, some change compound-final stems, and some which have allomorphs which add -(a)laa-min (or rarely -daa-laa-min) to the stem.Verbs also can be divided based on transitivity. Some require direct objects, some with optional objects, some with optional locational objects, and a few intransitive verbs.


=== Tense and aspect ===
Most final verbs mark tense, mood, and person, but most verbs can mark aspect and not tense and still be a final verb.
""initial consonant of the customary or class changing marker is retained""Tifal sentences are contain inflected verb-root-chains, often with a final fully conjugated verb. One must inflect for the amount of time between one verb in the chain and the next.


=== Deixis ===
Marking spatial relation between verbs and their objects is obligatory. ""up"" must be clarified as either ""upslope"" or ""upstream"", ""down"" as ""downslope"" or ""downstream"", and ""across"" as ""across land"" or ""across a river"".


=== Kinship ===
Tifal has dyadic kinship terms (terms referring to the relationship two or more people have to each other), which are present in less than 10 languages and not prevalent in Papua New Guinea. However, they are a salient feature of the Ok languages. Related terms are found in Oksapmin, Mian, and Telefol.

Marlin K. Jensen,"Marlin Keith Jensen (born May 18, 1942) is an American attorney who has been a general authority of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) since 1989. He served as the official Church Historian and Recorder of the church from 2005 to 2012. He was the 19th man to hold that calling since it was established in 1830. Jensen was made an emeritus general authority in the October 2012 general conference.


== Early life and education ==
Jensen was born in Huntsville, Utah. As a 19-year-old, he served as a missionary for the LDS Church in West Germany. After returning home in 1964, he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in German from Brigham Young University. He earned a Juris Doctor from the University of Utah College of Law in 1970, graduating first in his class.


== Career ==
At the age of 28, he served as bishop of his ward in Huntsville, as had both his father and grandfather. He later served as president of the Huntsville Utah Stake. In 1987 he became a regional representative for the Kaysville Utah and Layton Utah regions.Professionally, Jensen was an attorney in private practice in Ogden, Utah, specializing in business and estate planning. This supported his real passion of living a farming lifestyle. His family operates a ranching enterprise called Jensens' Middle Fork Ranch, in which he is a partner.In August 2012, Utah Governor Gary Herbert nominated Jensen to serve on the Utah State Board of Regents, which oversees the state's colleges and universities.


=== General authority ===
In 1989, Jensen became a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy at the age of 46. In 1993, he was made assistant executive director of the church's Priesthood Department, later becoming executive director until 2001. From 1993 to 1995, while a general authority, Jensen served as president of the church's New York Rochester Mission. In 1995, Jensen became a member of the church's Public Affairs Committee. From 1996 to 1998 he was executive director of the Church Historical Department. He served in the First Quorum of the Seventy until 1998, when he became a member of the Presidency of the Seventy, and in 2000 he also became the general president of the church's Sunday School. Jensen served in these positions until 2001. In 2004, he replaced D. Todd Christofferson as executive director of the Family and Church History Department, a position he held previously when it was just the Historical Department. In 2005, he became the first Church Historian and Recorder to serve since 1997. He served in this capacity until 2012 and was designated an emeritus general authority in October 2012.
Jensen is one of the few general authorities of the LDS Church who self-identifies as a member of the Democratic Party.


==== Area presidencies ====
Jensen has served in various area presidency positions. As a new Seventy in 1989, he was counselor to John K. Carmack, president of the Utah Central Area. From 1990 to 1992, Jensen served as president of the Utah North Area. He later served first as a counselor, then as president, of the North America Northeast Area. He was president of the Europe Central Area from 2001 to 2003.


==== Church Historian ====
Jensen was Church Historian and Recorder from 2005 to 2012, and executive director of the Church History Department from 2004 to 2012. In these roles and as a church official, Jensen has spoken at General Conference, BYU Women's Conference (1998), BYU Family History and Genealogy Conference (2006), Northern Utah Family History Conference (2006), Yale's American Society of Church History (2007), and the Mormon History Association Conference (2005 and 2007). Jensen has also notably attended various conferences, including the Library of Congress' Worlds of Joseph Smith Symposium (2005) and UVSC's Mormon Studies Conference (2008).
Not a trained historian or academic, Jensen brought a passion to his work; reading widely, gathering scholars, and implementing changes. Observers reported that his contributions ""helped transform the Utah-based faith's approach to its history,"" and saw the church's history department ""truly come of age."" Terryl Givens said of his legacy, ""Marlin Jensen has done more to further the cause of Mormon history than any person of the current generation.""Several major developments occurred during Jensen's leadership over the Church History Department.

Joseph Smith Papers Project: In 2001, the LDS Church and BYU created the Joseph Smith Papers Project, intended to revise and expand on the longtime work of Dean C. Jessee to collect and publish all known writings of Joseph Smith. Under Jensen, the project expanded into a 30-some volume, multi-year effort endorsed by the National Historical Publications and Records Commission of the National Archives. In 2005, Jensen said this was ""the single most significant historical project of our generation"".
Church History Library: Plans were finalized in 2005 to build a new 250,000-square-foot (23,000 m2), 5 floor building near Temple Square to house the church archives and history department staff. It was opened to the general public in June 2009.
Researchers return to archives: From 1980–1982, the church moved the History Division of the Historical Department to Provo, Utah, to become the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History at BYU. In late 2004, discussions began about returning researchers to the LDS Archives to increase pace and reduce costs in the Joseph Smith Papers Project. In June 2005, the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute was closed and the staff moved back to the Church Office Building, and in 2009 relocated again to the new Church History Library.
Church Historian's Press: On February 25, 2008, a new imprint called the Church Historian's Press was announced as the long-awaited publisher for the Joseph Smith Papers. Jensen mentioned the press could be used to publish George Q. Cannon's journals or other documentary works, and perhaps someday narrative histories and biographies that make use of the Church Archives.
Separate department: On March 12, 2008, the Family and Church History Department was divided into the Family History Department and the Church History Department.
New Assistant Church Historian called: On March 12, 2008, when the Church History Department was formed, Richard Turley was called as the first Assistant Church Historian since Davis Bitton was released in 1982.
Mountain Meadows: At the 2007 sesquicentennial of the Mountain Meadows massacre, descendants of the victims petitioned the LDS Church to secure landmark status for its holdings at the Mountain Meadows site. On March 28, 2008, Jensen addressed these families and said the LDS Church would seek National Historic Landmark designation for these properties, which was granted in 2011. He worked to strengthen relationships with the victims' descendants and encouraged publication of a new ""no-holds-barred"" history, coauthored by Jensen's Assistant, Richard Turley.
Technological modernization: Thousands of the LDS Church's historical documents were mass digitized and made freely available online, including the Joseph Smith Papers. Historian Jan Shipps called this ""a change that is so epochal it would be very hard to turn it back."" In addition to developing a new church-wide system for digitally collecting and managing records, the Church History Library's searchable catalog was made available online. A five-year plan was developed for using technology to preserve and share LDS history.
International history: The Church History Department decentralized its collecting of international church history. Church Historians were called for individual Areas and countries, and oral histories were to be gathered from mission presidents and area presidents when they were released. Before this time, little had been done to gather international church history. Jensen saw this project as ""one of the significant accomplishments in this period of time.""
Historical professionalism: Jensen worked to make the Church History Department authoritative and trusted within the LDS Church, as well as by ""historians who write from different points of view"". Jensen strained to make archive materials more publicly available and to set the tone of ""unflinching honesty ... for a whole new generation of LDS academics."" He attended academic conferences and was the first LDS general authority at the Mormon History Association annual meeting.In January 2012, it was announced that, after a transition period, Steven E. Snow would replace Jensen as the Church Historian and Recorder later in the year. Snow succeeded Jensen on August 1, 2012. On October 6, 2012, Jensen was then released from the First Quorum of the Seventy and designated as an emeritus general authority at the LDS Church's semi-annual general conference. LDS Church practice is to release Seventies from service following their 70th birthdays, which Jensen had observed in May of that year.


== Major statements ==
Jensen at times addressed the press or public as a church representative. He often acted as a peacemaker, attempting to bring understanding or empathy to divisive issues. While not always official church positions, his statements illustrated his candid views as a leader within the LDS Church.


=== Political parties ===
On April 22, 1998, Jensen was sent by the First Presidency to give an interview with the Salt Lake Tribune in reaction to a 1998 First Presidency statement and to explicitly state that someone could be a devout Mormon and a member of the Democratic Party. He lamented the decline of the Utah Democratic Party, and regretted that the Republican Party might be seen as the ""church party"". He felt that good Latter-day Saints will have conflicts with either party's platform, from which they must selectively pick and choose.Coming from a church official on assignment from the First Presidency, the comments surprised many prominent Utah politicians and Latter-day Saints.


=== The Mormons (PBS) ===
Jensen featured prominently in the 2007 PBS documentary The Mormons. His March 7, 2006 interview probed a variety of subjects, including some controversial topics.
Doubt: Jensen described questioning his religion while in philosophy classes where he had to ""test [his] belief against ... other theories."" This led him to reinforce his faith through deeper study.
Correlation: ""We are really trying to take account of cultural differences and to not feel that this Utah influence or even the American influence has to be worldwide.""
Folklore of the priesthood ban: Jensen recalled his attempts to have the church repudiate the rationale some use to explain the priesthood ban.
Historical truth claims: ""I think we take it very literally. We don't deconstruct and feel that what we have is the figment of language or our imagination, or that there is some middle ground. I know that is very polarizing. In a sense, I think the hardest public relations sell we have to make is that this is the only true church.""
Homosexuality: Jensen said the gospel allows either heterosexuality or celibacy. He empathized with celibate gay members, since the church cannot offer them hope of eventually finding love in this life as it can with single heterosexuals.
Faith-promoting history: Jensen questioned whether the Church Historian should only focus on reinforcing faith, or if he should also focus on ""objective"" histories.
Excommunicable doctrines: Jensen mentioned that members may receive disciplinary action in supporting gay marriage or opposing Book of Mormon divinity, if they are ""openly vocal"" and ""malign the leadership in the church for not adopting that position.""


=== Illegal immigrants ===
On February 13, 2008, Jensen urged the Utah State Legislature to show compassion in considering laws that would affect undocumented immigrants. Several bills were under debate to block undocumented access to jobs and public benefits, such as in-state tuition and driving privilege cards. On behalf of the First Presidency at Westminster College's Interfaith Dialogue on Immigration, Jensen said lawmakers should ""take a step back"" since this ""deal[s] with God's children"" and ""a more humane approach is warranted"".


=== Historical openness ===
In a February 25, 2008 press release about the new Church Historian's Press publishing the Joseph Smith Papers, Jensen offered instruction on how to approach church history. He asked for LDS historians to ""not be in an apologetic mode, but to be as open, candid and fair about our own history as we can"". They should foster a culture of mutual openness with the general historical community. Jensen observed ""greater dialogue coming about, less suspicion and a greater openness that is coming to pass"".


=== FLDS polygamy ===
On May 5, 2008, Jensen officially responded to Timothy Egan's New York Times op-ed piece which claimed that FLDS polygamy ""is a look back at some of the behavior of Mormonism's founding fathers"". Jensen strongly disagreed and pointed out that by 19th-century norms a 15-year-old bride was not unusual nor considered abused and the ""common-law marriage age for women was 12"". Plural marriages were ""not controlled by the authority of one individual"" and ""the consent of individual women was always honored in any marriage proposal"". In addition, many 19th-century polygamous wives were well-educated, politically active professionals.


=== Gay marriage ===
On September 19, 2010, members of the Oakland, California stake were invited to share with Jensen their experiences and troubles over the LDS Church's involvement in the Proposition 8 campaign to ban gay marriage in California. After several recounted their painful experiences, Jensen responded with empathy and a personal apology, saying, ""To the full extent of my capacity, I say that I am sorry .... I know that many very good people have been deeply hurt, and I know that the Lord expects better of us.""


=== Modern apostasy ===
At the invitation of Utah State University professor Philip Barlow, Jensen held a ""Q&A"" with a Mormon Studies student group on November 11, 2011. Jensen was asked if church leaders were aware that members were discovering problems with LDS Church history through the internet, and what is to be done for those who may be affected or ""who are already leaving in droves"". Jensen responded that top church leaders ""realize that, maybe, since Kirtland we've never had a period of, I'll call it apostasy, like we're having right now, largely over these issues."" He said a new church initiative would give answers to troubling questions, and such issues should be discussed more openly with the new internet-savvy generation. These remarks were recorded by a student and circulated online, and were picked up in a Reuters ""Special Report"". Jensen later clarified that critics were overstating his remarks, saying ""To say we are experiencing some Titanic-like wave of apostasy is inaccurate.""


== Personal life ==
Jensen married Kathleen Bushnell on June 9, 1967 in the Salt Lake Temple. They are the parents of eight children.

Biography at Joseph Smith Papers Project website (accessed May 4, 2012)","Marlin Keith Jensen (born May 18, 1942) is an American attorney who has been a general authority of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) since 1989. He served as the official Church Historian and Recorder of the church from 2005 to 2012.

Heinrich Dorn,"Heinrich Ludwig Egmont Dorn (14 November 1800 or 1804 – 10 January 1892) was a German conductor, composer, teacher, and journalist. He was born in Königsberg, where he studied piano, singing, and composition. Later, he studied in Berlin with Ludwig Berger, Bernhard Klein, and Carl Friedrich Zelter. His first opera, Rolands Knappen, was produced in 1826, and was a success. Around this time, he became co-editor of the Berliner allgemeine Musikzeitung.
Dorn became well known as a conductor of opera, and held theatre posts at Königsberg (1828), Leipzig (1829–32), Hamburg (1832), Riga (1834–43), and Cologne (1844–8). In 1849, he became co-conductor, with Wilhelm Taubert, of the Berlin Hofoper - a post he held until 1869.
Dorn taught counterpoint to the young Robert Schumann, and was a friend of Franz Liszt. He was a harsh critic of Richard Wagner, but was persuaded to conduct the opera Tannhäuser, in 1855.  He also wrote an opera Die Nibelungen, based on the Nibelungenlied, in 1853, many years before Wagner completed Der Ring des Nibelungen.
Dorn died in Berlin in 1892.

Mary O'Malley (playwright),"Mary Josephine O'Malley (19 March 1941 – 19 September 2020) was an English playwright of Irish-Lithuanian descent.


== Early career ==
In the 1960s Mary O'Malley studied drama at the City Literary Institute, and ""Improvisation and Playmaking"" with Dorothea Alexander.  In the mid-1970s, while working in fringe theatre, she joined The Writers' Workshop run by Howard Brenton at the Royal Court Theatre. Early experimental work for theatre in the early 1970s included A 'Nevolent Society, a lunchtime production at the Open Space Theatre, Tottenham Court Road, Superscum and Oh if Ever a Man Suffered, lunchtime productions at the Soho Theatre, the latter play transferring to Hampstead Theatre for a short run as a late night production. Plays for television in the early to mid-1970s included two short plays by writers new to television, Percy and Kenneth and Shall I See You Now for the BBC in Birmingham, produced by Tara Prem.


== Later career ==
In 1975 The Royal Court commissioned O'Malley to write a play, which became Once a Catholic.  The play, directed by Mike Ockrent, opened at the Royal Court in 1977 and later transferred to Wyndham's Theatre, where it ran for over two years.  In 1977 the play won awards from The Evening Standard and Plays & Players, and in 1978 O'Malley was the first winner of the Susan Smith Blackburn Prize for women playwrights.
Once a Catholic has been performed on tours and at regional theatres in Britain, including the Lyric Theatre (Belfast). In 1979 a production directed by Mike Ockrent was taken on a short tour of theatres in the US before opening at the Helen Hayes Theatre in New York, where it closed after six performances.  In 1987 the play was produced in Los Angeles at The Celtic Arts Centre (An Claidheamh Soluis), in North Hollywood, from which the author received the Hollywood Drama-Logue Critics Award for ""outstanding achievement in theatre""; it was directed by Joe Praml from which the director received the Hollywood Drama-Logue Critics Award for Direction; Morgan Walsh and David Farjeon received the Award for Acting. There have been productions in Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Germany, and Belgium, and in 1991 in Opole, Poland, at the Jan Kochanowski Theatre.
In 1977 O'Malley wrote Oy Vay Maria for BBC television, directed by Richard Loncraine.  It won a Pye Television Award, was televised in Israel, and produced as a stage play at the Liberal Jewish Synagogue, St John's Wood in 1981, and the Oldham Coliseum in 1996. In 1978 she wrote Look Out...Here Comes Trouble for the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Donmar Warehouse, directed by John Caird.  Set in a psychiatric hospital, it is an ensemble piece for fourteen actors, one of whom was Maxine Audley who received a London Critics Award for her performance as Olive, a clairvoyant.
Other work includes On the Shelf for television (1984) produced by Margaret Matheson, and Talk of the Devil at the Watford Playhouse (1986) directed by Bill Alexander.

Pytine,"Pytine is an extinct genus of asaphid trilobites. Species lived during the later part of the Arenig stage of the Ordovician Period, approximately 478 to 471 million years ago.  Various species are found in the Svalbard, Valhallfonna Formation, Olenidsletta,  Member, of Spitzbergen, Norway, the Megistaspis (Paramegistaspis) planilimbata Zone of the 'Shumardia Shale' of Sweden, Jujuy Province, Argentina, early Arenig-aged strata of Jiangxi province, China, and Darriwilian-aged strata in Western Hunan province, China. The type species, P. graia, has seven thorax segments, and lacks the rapier-like glabellar spine, that occurs in many other raphiophorids.  The Chinese species, by contrast, have only six thoracic segments. So far, only the type species, and one of the Chinese species, P. laevigata (synonym= Jiuxiella laevigata), are known from complete specimens.


== Species and synonymy ==
Richard Fortey erected the genus in 1975 upon describing P. graia from Spitzbergen.    In 1999, Hoel subjectively synonymized a Swedish species of Ampyx, A. brevicauda, into Pytine.  The Chinese raphiophorid genera Jiuxiella and Miboshania were noted to be anatomically similar to P. graia, and were merged into Pytine, as well.  In 2006, N. E. Vaccari described P. wirayasqa from several fragments from the early Arenig-aged Acoite Formation, of La Ciénaga, Jujuy province, Argentina, together with specimens of another related raphiophorid genus, Lehnertia.


== Etymology ==
Pytine is derived from an Ancient Greek word for a wineflask with wattles, referring to the shape and wrinkled texture of the glabellum.

Night Train (Oscar Peterson album),"Night Train is an album by the Oscar Peterson Trio, released in 1963 by Verve Records. The album includes jazz, blues and R&B standards, as well as ""Hymn to Freedom,"" one of Peterson's best known original compositions.


== Background ==
Album producer Norman Granz had sold the record label Verve, but remained Peterson's manager, and so supervised the Night Train recording session. The brief duration of many of the tracks has been attributed to a desire to have them played on commercial radio, which was reluctant to play any tracks longer than a few minutes.The cover art photograph is by Pete Turner and original sleeve notes were by Benny Green.
The album was dedicated to Peterson’s father, who worked as a sleeping-car attendant for Canadian Pacific Railways. 


== Music and recording ==
A Jazz.com review notes that the title track, ""Night Train,"" is evidence of Peterson's ability to balance musical innovation with popular appeal, as demonstrated throughout the album: ""By using the basic elements of crescendo and diminuendo, and arranged sections to set off the parts, Peterson turns what could have been a throwaway into a minor masterpiece.""Night Train’s only original Oscar Peterson composition, ""Hymn to Freedom,"" was written on the spot in the studio to close the album, following Norman Granz’s suggestion that the band include a song with a ""definitive early-blues feel."" Peterson named the new song ""Hymn to Freedom"" in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr., and after Harriette Hamilton wrote accompanying lyrics a year later, it became an unofficial anthem of the Civil Rights Movement.  ""Hymn to Freedom"" is featured prominently in the 2023 documentary Oscar Peterson: Black + White as part of Peterson’s enduring legacy. On the 1997 CD reissue, an alternate take of ""Night Train"" is titled ""Happy Go Lucky Local,"" the name of the 1946 Duke Ellington composition that is the basis of Jimmy Forrest's ""Night Train."" The alternate take features the same arrangement as the master take.
Ed Thigpen's rivet cymbal, recorded at very close range, is prominent on all issues of the album.


== Reception ==
Writing for AllMusic, critic John Bush wrote the release ""includes stately covers of blues and R&B standards"". The Penguin Guide to Jazz included it in its core collection, calling it “one of the best-constructed long-players of the period"" and saying that Peterson's playing is ""tight and uncharacteristically emotional"".In 2019, the album was named as the jury winner of the Polaris Heritage Prize.


== Influence ==
Diana Krall reported that listening to the album made being a jazz pianist her ambition. Linda May Han Oh reported that listening to the album inspired her to start playing upright bass.

Eva Maria Mudrich,"Eva Maria Mudrich (13 July 1927 – 6 December 2006) was a German journalist and author, originally from Berlin. After moving to the west of the country in 1959 she came to wider prominence as the writer of a succession of radio plays, focusing initially on the science fiction, and subsequently broadening her scope to include crime drama.Sources may also identify her, using her long-running pseudonym, as ""Maren Offenburg"".


== Life and works ==
Eva Maria Ehrhard was born in Berlin. She was not quite 18 when the World War II ended and she took her first job, working initially as an internee with a Berlin daily newspaper. It was here that she met Heinz Mudrich (1925–2016) whom she subsequently married.   It was, according to Mudrich, a ""lightning encounter that lasted sixty years"".   In 1950 she moved on to undertake freelance work with various radio stations, concentrating on programmes for schools, children and young people and ""women's topics"".By 1959 Heinz and Eva Maria Mudrich had married one another. Their son, the jazz pianist Christoph Mudrich (1960–2019), was born the next year. Meanwhile, Heinz Mudrich accepted a new job as Arts Editor with the Saarbrücker Zeitung which meant quitting Berlin and settling in Saarbrücken, where the media profile that Eva had built up through her radio work 700 kilometers away, in the Berlin area, counted for very little.While still in Berlin, during the 1950s, using the pseudonym ""Maren Offenburg"", she wrote a number of light romances which were published by Boje Verlag.   Their intended audience was adolescent girls and young women, and they came with titles such as ""Eine Mücke im Eden"" (1955 - ""A midget in Eden""), ""Du bis nicht allein"" (1956 - ""You are not alone"") and ""Susanne über den Wolken (1955 - ""Susanne above the clouds"").By 1970, which was the year in which her son celebrated his tenth birthday, Mudrich began writing radio plays.  The first of her works to be produced, ""Das Experiment"", formed the basis of four radio productions between 1970 and 1972 (only three of which were transmitted): a printed adaptation appeared a few years later.   In 1972 the Cologne-based Westdeutscher Rundfunk (national broadcaster) organised a competition for science fiction radio plays in order, it was explained, to encourage a new generation of German writers.   Mudrich was one of four prize winners with ""Das Glück von Ferida"" (loosely ""The good fortune of Ferida"") which had its first outing on 21 May 1973.   This led directly to a commission to produce a further 20 radio plays.   Many more science fiction radio plays followed, mostly for Horst Krautkrämer at the SDR radio studio in Heidelberg, along with a succession of criminal dramas, mostly produced for WDR.   There were also more than 100 short radio plays, most of which were written for Deutsche Welle, and many of which were cut-down versions of her earlier works.In 1993 she won the Kurd Laßwitz science-fiction Best Radio Play prize with her ""Sommernachtstraum"" (loosely, ""Midsummer Night's Dream"").


== Evaluation ==
Eva Maria Mudrich can be seen as a pioneer of the demanding science fiction genre, both through her application of socio-political themes and on account of the metaphysical and idealistic references that she incorporates.  A number of commentators have been prompted to rank the quality of her work alongside that produced by Wolfgang Jeschke, Herbert W. Franke, Hermann Ebeling and Richard Hey.

Maya Anne Ford, was born on January 8, 1979, in Oakland, California, on the same day as her former band member Torry Castellano. She met future bandmates Torry Castellano, Brett Anderson and Allison Robertson in junior high school. They formed a band in 8th grade called Ragady Anne, later calling themselves The Electrocutes at Palo Alto High School. Ford started to play the bass guitar at age 13. Initially she was playing guitar (she received an acoustic guitar from her cousin), but then she decided to switch to the bass. When her band (then known as Screen) started in May 1993, she had had approximately six months of playing experience.

Paintings from El Burgal,"The Paintings from El Burgal is group of paintings exhibited at the National Art Museum of Catalonia in Barcelona.


== Description ==
The very noteworthy style of the paintings from the Burgal apse is linked to the Pedret Circle, of Lombardic influence. The programme of images, with its marked Eucharistic and ecclesiological sense (referring to the Eucharist and the Church), contained a Theophany or vision of the divinity on the vault, which was presided by the figure of the Maiestas Domini or Christ in Majesty, which to judge from the surviving remains must have been monumental. It was flanked by the figures of two prophets in a reverent attitude of beseeching and by two archangels carrying signs with inscriptions on which they advocated for sinners. These have been partly preserved. In the lower register is a representation of the Church militant, with imposing, grim-looking apostles and saints sitting in a semicircle and centred by the figures of Mary, with the chalice, and John the Baptist, with the Lamb, the symbol of the death and resurrection of Christ, of great Eucharistic significance.
Beside them are Peter, with the keys, Paul, with a scroll and a volume, and John the Evangelist, on the right, plus another apostle on the left. An attractive Greek fret separates this area from the painted drapery there was at the bottom of the apse.
What especially distinguishes this apse is the figure of the richly dressed female donor holding a lighted candle. She appears superimposed on the drapery, as though approaching the holy images. She is wearing a luxurious dress decorated with precious
stones and from the remains of an inscription can be identified as the Countess Llúcia, wife of Artau I of Pallars Sobirà. The paintings probably date from the time of their children Artau II and Ot, who was soon to be bishop of Urgell. In the
church, in situ, close to the apse, is the portrait of other characters, presumably also members of the count’s family.

Euromast,"Euromast is an observation tower in Rotterdam, Netherlands, designed by Hugh Maaskant constructed between 1958 and 1960. It was specially built for the 1960 Floriade, and is a listed monument since 2010. The tower is a concrete structure with an internal diameter of 9 m (30 ft) and a wall thickness of 30 cm (12 in).  For stability it is built on a concrete block of 1,900,000 kg (4,200,000 lb) so that the centre of gravity is below ground. It has a ""crow's nest"" observation platform 96 m (315 ft) above ground and a restaurant. Originally 101 m (331 ft) in height it was the tallest building in Rotterdam. It lost this position to the high-rise of Erasmus MC (113.5 m, 372 ft) which was completed in 1968, but regained it when the Space Tower was added to the top of the building in 1970, giving an additional 85 m (279 ft). Euromast was the highest building of the Netherlands, but was surpassed by De Zalmhaven, also in Rotterdam, in 2021. It is also a member of the World Federation of Great Towers. In 2008, 2009 and 2019, the tower hosted an extreme sports event which featured BASE jumping. A new event was expected in September 2022.

Russian submarine Delfin,"Delfin (Russian: Дельфин, lit. 'Dolphin') was the first combat-capable Russian submarine. She was commissioned in 1903 and decommissioned in 1917, having served during World War I. During a test dive in 1904, 25 crew were killed.


== Design ==
Delfin was designed by Naval architect Senior Assistant Ivan Grigoryevich Bubnov, Lieutenant M.N. Beklemishev and Lieutenant I.S. Goryunov of the Construction Commission for Submarines (later the Rubin Design Bureau). The design was of a single-hull type submarine with saddle tanks whose outer plating was covered with teak to prevent damage in the case of grounding. She was ordered in July 1901 laid down by Baltic Works at St. Petersburg, launched in 1902, and entered service in 1903, training officers and sailors. Initially the vessel was classed as a torpedo boat and only given a number instead of a name.


=== General characteristics ===
Delfin displaced 113 tons surfaced and 126 tons submerged. She was 19.6 metres (64 ft) long with a beam of 3.3 metres (11 ft) and a draught of 2.9 metres (9 ft 6 in). The submarine was powered by one gasoline/electric motor that created 300 bhp and 120 hp respectively that drove one shaft. This gave Delfin a speed of 9 knots (17 km/h; 10 mph) surfaced and 4.5 knots (8.3 km/h; 5.2 mph) submerged. The ship was crewed by 22 men, including officers.


=== Armament ===
Delfin's main armament was two external 15 in (380 mm) torpedoes in Drzewiecki drop collars. The boat was also equipped with one machine gun.


== Service history ==
While undergoing her first sea trials, Delfin's ballast tanks were faulty and it took 12 minutes to complete her dive. This foreshadowed future events for the vessel. On 29 June 1904 the submarine sank in the Neva River by the wall of the Baltic Shipyard during a test dive. The captain and 24 crewmen were killed, and 12 men were rescued. The vessel was raised 3 July and transferred to the Siberian flotilla, arriving in Vladivostok in late 1904. Delfin returned to service in February 1905.In May 1905, Delfin sank again after suffering an explosion due to petrol vapours. She returned to service after the Russo-Japanese War had ended.During World War I Delfin was transferred to Murmansk in October 1916 and served in the Northern flotilla. She was found to be unsuitable for combat operations and was deleted in August 1917. While awaiting disposal in Murmansk, she was sunk. The remains were scrapped in 1920.The centenary of Delfin’s sinking - the first Russian submarine accident - was marked by the St. Petersburg Submariners Club with wreath-laying, a mourning service, and by guards of honor and an orchestra marching at the Smolenskoye Orthodox cemetery.

Chris Joyce,"Chris Joyce (born 11 October 1957, Manchester, England) is an English musician, known for being the drummer with various groups, and with Simply Red in the 1980s.
Coming from Chorlton, Manchester, he adopted the hippie lifestyle. His most remote band was Fast Breeder, a short-lived late 1970s punk group from Manchester formed by him on drums and Dave Rowbotham on guitar and managed by Tony Wilson. Wilson called Joyce and Rowbotham to form a band alongside guitarist Vini Reilly and bass guitarist Tony Bowers, The Durutti Column. That line-up released only two songs from Factory's first EP, A Factory Sample, before Joyce, Rowbotham and Bowers quit the band to form another post-punk band around 1979, The Mothmen.
The Mothmen released only two studio albums and a number of singles, before disbanding in the 1980s. During his time with The Mothmen, Joyce worked with Pink Military, London Underground and Judy Nylon. By the mid-1980s, he was working with Suns of Arqa, playing drums on their second LP Wadada Magic.  He later formed Simply Red, alongside his bandmate Tony Bowers and singer Mick Hucknall.
Joyce shares further details of his life and career, up to and beyond his work with Simply Red, in his biography on Chris Joyce School of Drums.

Aberdeen Pheasants,"The Aberdeen Pheasants was the primary moniker minor league baseball teams located in Aberdeen, South Dakota between 1920 and 1997. The Pheasants played in the Northern League from 1946 until the league folded in 1971. Aberdeen was the Class C affiliate of the St. Louis Browns until 1953, continuing with the franchise when the Browns moved to Baltimore in 1954, with the Pheasants remaining in the Oriole farm system.  Aberdeen had a team in the Independent Prairie League from 1995 to 1997, also called the Pheasants.


== Origins ==
Aberdeen has always been a baseball town with organized teams playing semi-professional ball as far back as the 1890s. The Dakota League was organized after World War I and offered Aberdeen fans their first taste of professional baseball, as Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Al Simmons played for Aberdeen in 1922. That league folded in 1922. After World War II another professional baseball team, the Aberdeen Pheasants, was organized in Aberdeen as part of the Northern League and had their inaugural season in 1947.
Ben Siebrecht, owner of Siebrecht Florist and Greenhouse, was the president of a five-member board charged with the duties of organizing and operating that early Pheasants team. The board raised $25,000 by selling stock to local investors and were able to establish a working agreement with the St. Louis Browns as a source for players. That agreement survived the Browns' move to Baltimore and became the longest working agreement between major and minor league teams in baseball history lasting 26 years.
Many big name players wore the Aberdeen Pheasants uniform at some time in their careers. Pitcher Don Larsen, famous for pitching a perfect game in the 1956 World Series as a New York Yankee, played for the Pheasants in 1947 and 1948. Bob Turley was a 1949 Pheasant prior to winning the Cy Young Award in 1958 as a New York Yankee. Tito Francona played on the 1953 Pheasants prior to playing on 8 different major league teams. He even married an Aberdeen girl, Roberta Jackson, at home plate prior to a home game. Earl Weaver managed the club for the 1959 season. Jim Palmer pitched for the Pheasants during the 1964 season. Earl Weaver and Jim Palmer are the only former Pheasants to be named to the baseball hall of fame. Dave Leonhard pitched for the 1963 and 1964 Pheasants and pitched for the Baltimore Orioles from 1967–1972. Mark Belanger was also on the 1964 Pheasants and was eventually named the American League all-star shortstop in 1976 as an Oriole. Lou Piniella played for the 1964 team prior to moving to the majors that same season. Cal Ripken, Sr. was a manager of the Pheasants for the 1963–1966 season.
The minor league Pheasants met their demise when the Northern League folded after the 1971 season. The remaining teams, who all folded, were the Aberdeen Pheasants, Sioux Falls Packers, St. Cloud Rox and Watertown Expos.


== Ballparks ==
Games were played at the municipal ball field located on the campus of Northern State University. The original stadium burned down in 1952 and was quickly replaced. Eventually the replacement stadium was torn down to make room for the Barnett Center. Early games during the first season started at 5:30pm because the field wasn't lighted but later during that season, lights were added thanks to contributions from the enthusiastic fans. The Pheasants built a steady fan base drawing crowds of over 3000 by their second season.


== Mascot ==
Not to be forgotten is ""Philbert"" the cartoon pheasant drawn by Gordon Haug, the advertising artist for Aberdeen's Olwin-Angell department store. Philbert appeared on the front page of the Aberdeen American News the morning after each game with an appropriate comment about the game's outcome.


== Significant events ==
The biggest game in Pheasant history took place in 1964 when the parent team, the Baltimore Orioles, came to town to play their minor league cohorts. The Orioles posted a 6-3 win in front of a capacity crowd.
The Pheasants' final season was 1971.
In 1995, local baseball enthusiasts re-established the Aberdeen Pheasant team and gave Aberdeen fans three seasons of baseball excitement prior to disbanding the organization at the end of the 1997 season.  During the 1995 season, the Pheasants ran over their Prairie League competition, setting an all-time minor-league record for winning percentage by going 56-13 (.812) in the league's regular season.
Historic information and photos provided by the Dacotah Prairie Museum.In 2010, the former Sioux Falls (South Dakota) Canaries team was renamed the Sioux Falls Fighting Pheasants, presumably to give new life to the Pheasants franchise.  The move was not without controversy, as discussed in this editorial from the Aberdeen American News.

Letov Š-19,"The Letov Š-19 was an airliner produced in small numbers in Czechoslovakia during the 1920s. 


== Design and development ==
Following tests with an Š-6 bomber over domestic passenger routes, ČSA requested that a passenger-carrying version be developed. While retaining the basic layout of the Š-6, the Š-19 added a fully enclosed passenger cabin within the fuselage, with seating for four. The pilot had an open cockpit behind the cabin.
Three machines were built with the same Maybach engine that had powered the bomber version, but these were found to have poor flying characteristics, and for the other four examples produced, a Walter powerplant was used instead, along with making some refinements to the ailerons and wing bracing.
Put into service on the Prague-Košice route, the type was not a success. The passenger cabin was very noisy, since it was placed immediately behind the engine. Furthermore, this placement made boarding and disembarking awkward, and visibility for the passengers was poor. Besides this, the Š-19 could not match the performance offered by foreign aircraft, and no further production was undertaken.

It is generally uncommon throughout its range, with populations becoming fragmented in the north. Viola walteri is found in rich calcareous forests and woodlands, often in dry rocky areas. It is a spring ephemeral, flowering March through May. It distinguished by its creeping, rooting stolons, which is thought to be indicative of it being transitional between the caulescent and acaulescent violets.
This species is similar to Viola appalachiensis, which was once considered a variety of Viola walteri.

I Married a Monster from Outer Space,"I Married a Monster from Outer Space is a 1958 American horror science fiction film from Paramount Pictures, produced and directed by Gene Fowler Jr., that stars Tom Tryon and Gloria Talbott. Paramount released the film as a double feature with The Blob.
The film's storyline concerns a young wife who begins to realize that her husband is not the man he was before they married. He has lost all real affection for her and for his new pet dog, which she gave him as a present. Thereafter, she quickly discovers that he is not the only man in town that appears to have changed. Now suspicious, she follows him one evening when he goes out for a walk and shockingly discovers that her husband is actually an alien humanoid. 


== Plot ==
After a year of marriage, Marge Farrell (Gloria Talbott) is despondent that her husband Bill (Tom Tryon) is cold and not acting toward her the way he did before they were married. He doesn't show any signs of genuine affection towards her or toward his new dog, a surprise anniversary present from Marge. The dog barks and snarls at him whenever he approaches; he kills it in their basement, telling Marge the dog was strangled by his collar while pulling on his tethered leash. She is also becoming concerned because, wanting a family, she has not become pregnant. After undergoing various tests, her doctor assures her that she can have children; he suggests that Bill come in and see him to be tested.
She soon notices that other husbands in their social circle are acting the same way. One night, she follows Bill when he goes out for a long walk. He heads to an isolated area in the woods, where she discovers that he is not the man she thought she married but an alien impostor. An extraterrestrial life form leaves Bill's body shell and then enters a hidden spaceship.
She confronts the alien Bill, and he eventually explains that all the females on his dead planet are extinct. He and the other males of his species are taking over human men so they can have offspring with Earth's women, saving their race from extinction. Marge is horrified at the prospect and tries to warn others of the alien plot, but too many men in town have already been taken over, including the town's Chief of Police, who does nothing after hearing her story. She attempts to call Washington, D.C., but all outgoing phone lines are busy. She attempts to leave by car and the local police stop her, saying that the only exit bridge which leads out of town is down.
Finally, her doctor (Ken Lynch) comes to believe her wild story, and he gathers up a posse of men he knows cannot be disguised aliens, having recently fathered children. They attack the aliens in their hidden spaceship. Bullets can't hurt the invaders, who are surrounded by a force barrier. The aliens, however, prove to be defenseless against a pair of German Shepherd dogs being used by the posse. The aliens are killed when the dogs attack, all except the alien Bill.
Entering the spaceship, the posse finds that all the human male captives are unconscious but still alive, including Bill. The men are each hooked up to an apparatus that helps the aliens become their captors while living in faux human shells. The posse begins to disconnect the captives, which kills the aliens one-by-one. Shortly before his faux human body is destroyed, the alien occupying the Chief of Police broadcasts a warning to his people in orbit that they've been discovered by the humans. Thereafter, a fleet of alien spaceships is seen leaving Earth space. They must seek out humanoid females elsewhere now that their breeding plan on Earth has been discovered.


== Cast ==


== Production ==
Both director Gene Fowler Jr. and screenwriter Louis Vittes had worked in series television and had some success. With I Married a Monster from Outer Space, both had some creative freedom, although Vittes was notoriously resistant to any changes to his script, to the annoyance of the leads. Principal photography for I Married a Monster from Outer Space began on April 21 and ended in early May 1958. The film marked Fowler's second directorial effort following I Was a Teenage Werewolf (1957). Prior to this, Fowler had worked closely as an editor for Fritz Lang.


== Release ==
On September 10, 1958, the film premiered in Los Angeles, followed by its U.S. and Canadian theatrical release in October.


=== Critical response ===
Upon its release, I Married a Monster from Outer Space proved to be a hit with audiences and critics. Despite its modest budget and unpretentious production values, the film was ideal filler for drive-in audiences. Originally slated as the A film in a double feature with The Blob (1958), I Married a Monster from Outer Space was relegated to the bottom of the playbill because audiences preferred the intriguing full color monster feature over this monochromatic, more sombre, domestic invasion entry.Due to its exploitative and sensationalized title, I Married a Monster from Outer Space has long been ignored by critics and film historians, although it received respectable reviews, both in contemporary and in later reviews. Variety's 1958 review wrote, ""Fowler's direction, while sometimes slow, latches onto mounting suspense as action moves to climax. He gets the benefit of outstanding special photographic effects from John P. Fulton, which aid in maintaining interest."" Harrison's Reports declared, ""This latest addition to the current cycle of science-fiction-horror melodramas is just as fantastic as the others in its category, but it is more imaginative than most and should prove to be a good supporting feature wherever such pictures are acceptable."" The Monthly Film Bulletin of Britain wrote, ""This generally well-acted and -staged Science Fiction thriller, though novelettish in its personal story, has an intriguing situation and some effective, if rather sparse, trick camerawork."" Danny Peary described it as ""an intelligent, atmospheric, subtly made sci-fi thriller"". Tom Milne of Time Out magazine found ""good performances, strikingly moody camerawork, a genuinely exciting climax"", and Leonard Maltin called it a ""pretty good little rehash of Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" with ""some nice, creepy moments"".The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:

In 2004 Paramount released a DVD of the film which, other than the open matte, full frame (1.33:1) format of the 1998 VHS release, cropped the original 1:85:1 image to the modern 16:9 (1.78:1) TV aspect ratio.The label L'Atelier 13 released a Spanish language DVD under the title Me casé con un monstruo del espacio exterior.In 2020, the film was released on Blu-ray through the Australian label Imprint.
In 2023, Shout! Factory released a ""double feature"" Blu-ray, which also included Conquest of Space.


=== Themes ===
The Aurum Film Encyclopedia concluded that ""while the film was clearly fueled by the Cold War mentality of the fifties, in retrospect it is its sexual politics that are more interesting, and disturbing"". The hint at a subtext of ""sexual angst"" by Tom Milne is emphasized by German critic Georg Seeßlen, linking I Married a Monster from Outer Space and Attack of the 50 Foot Woman (1958) to film noir: Their subjects in common, states Seeßlen, are the distrust between the sexes and the depiction of marriage as a trap where the death of one partner seems inevitable. Sex is referenced continuously throughout the film, notes Cranny-Francis, and although the audience is aware alien–human coupling has occurred, the aliens fail when they cannot impregnate Earth women.Film scholar Harry M. Benshoff suggests that the film features a blatant subtext of male homosexuality, citing the lead character of Bill's preference to ""meet other strange men in the public park"" rather than stay at home with his wife.


== Remake ==
In 1998 the now defunct UPN television network produced and aired a remake of the film titled I Married a Monster, with Richard Burgi as the alien husband.

Huainanzi,"The Huainanzi is an ancient Chinese text that consists of a collection of essays that resulted from a series of scholarly debates held at the court of Liu An, Prince of Huainan, sometime before 139 BC.  The Huainanzi blends Daoist, Confucianist, and Legalist concepts, including theories such as yin and yang and Wu Xing theories.
The Huainanzi's essays are all connected to one primary goal: attempting to define the necessary conditions for perfect socio-political order. It concludes that perfect societal order derives mainly from a perfect ruler, and the essays are compiled in such a way as to serve as a handbook for an enlightened sovereign and his court.


== The book ==
Scholars are reasonably certain regarding the date of composition for the Huainanzi. Both the Book of Han and Records of the Grand Historian record that when Liu An paid a state visit to his nephew the Emperor Wu of Han in 139 BC, he presented a copy of his ""recently completed"" book in twenty-one chapters. Recent research shows that Chapters 1, 2, and 21 of the Huainanzi were performed at the imperial court.The Huainanzi is an eclectic compilation of chapters or essays that range across topics of religion, history, astronomy, geography, philosophy, science, metaphysics, nature, and politics. It discusses many pre-Han schools of thought, especially the Huang–Lao form of religious Daoism, and contains more than 800 quotations from Chinese classics. The textual diversity is apparent from the chapter titles (tr. Le Blanc, 1985, 15–16):

Some Huainanzi passages are philosophically significant, for instance, this combination of Five Phases and Daoist themes.  

When the lute-tuner strikes the kung note [on one instrument], the kung note [on the other instrument] responds: when he plucks the chiao note [on one instrument], the chiao note [on the other instrument] vibrates. This results from having corresponding musical notes in mutual harmony. Now, [let us assume that] someone changes the tuning of one string in such a way that it does not match any of the five notes, and by striking it sets all twenty-five strings resonating. In this case there has as yet been no differentiation as regards sound; it just happens that that [sound] which governs all musical notes has been evoked.
Thus, he who is merged with Supreme Harmony is beclouded as if dead-drunk, and drifts about in its midst in sweet contentment, unaware how he came there; engulfed in pure delight as he sinks to the depths; benumbed as he reaches the end, he is as if he had not yet begun to emerge from his origin. This is called the Great Merging. (chapter 6, tr. Le Blanc 1985:138)

Treviglio,"Treviglio (Italian: [treˈviʎʎo] ; Bergamasque: Treì) is a town and comune (i.e. municipality) in the province of Bergamo, in Lombardy, Northern Italy. It lies 20 kilometres (12 miles) south of the province capital, in the lower territory called Bassa Bergamasca.
It's also part of the geographic area named Gera d'Adda, included among the rivers Fosso Bergamasco to the North, Adda to the West and Serio to the East.
With approximately 30,000 inhabitants, the comune is now the second most populous town in the province.
It is sometimes dubbed ""the tractor town"" for the presence of the SAME Deutz-Fahr headquarters, or less frequently ""the town of courtyards"" for their preponderant presence in the Old Town.
It is subdivided in five main quarters: Old town, West zone, North zone, the recent built East zone and the PIP (industrial zone). Northward lie four frazioni (boroughs): Geromina, Castel Cerreto, Battaglie and Cascina Pezzoli; once the village of Castel Rozzone was also a frazione of Treviglio.
The coat of arms is composed of a crenellated tower, which represents the city with its Ghibelline past; flanked by two golden lions rampant, for its free and valiant citizenry and topped by an eagle, symbol of the privileges obtained by the Holy Roman Empire, which is holding a pig aloft, symbol of the achieved prosperity.


== History ==
The area where Treviglio lies was firstly inhabited by Celtic tribes, in particular Insubres.
During the conquest of the Cisalpine Gaul (Gallia Cisalpina) by the Romans a castrum was built to guard an important trading cross way and the near villages.
Afterward a Roman settlement was founded and grew through trade and local goods manufacture.
After the arrival of the Lombards the territory was included in the Fara Gera d'Adda (Fara which was an administrative division of the Lombard system) and, after the fall of the Kingdom of the Lombards it became part of the Holy Roman Empire.
Treviglio was founded in the Early Middle Ages as a fortified town, unifying three preexisting settlements: Cusarola (Celtic), Pisignano (Roman) and Portoli (Lombard). Thus the original town was divided into three districts, called 'portae' (Latin for ""gates""), each headed toward one of the settlements: ""Porta Torre"" to the village of Cusarola; ""Porta Zeduro"" (named originally ""Zelute"") to Portoli and ""Porta Filagno"" to that of Pisignano.
The first official document found citing the new town dates back to November 964 D.C.
Around the year 1000 Treviglio harboured the inhabitants of Oriano, a commune near Brescia, which had been destroyed in the course of the struggle between Arduin of Ivrea and Henry II who were warring for the Imperial crown.
During the wars that had taken place in Northern Italy the city of Treviglio grew harbouring refugees in the new fourth district of ""Porta Nova"" (literally ""New Gate""), originally called "" Porta Oriano"" for the refugees from Oriano.
The Rozzoni family, at that time powerful, tried in vain a coup d'état, and was as a consequence temporarily exiled in its property near Treviglio, ""Castel Rozzone"" (in Italian ""Rozzoni's Castle"") that nowadays is a village independent from the city itself.
In 1167 Treviglio joined the first Lombard League, which had the aim of preserving local jurisdiction and droit de régale, a purpose that was achieved with the victory over emperor Frederick I 'Barbarossa', at the Battle of Legnano. The earliest copy of the Statute found dates 1392 and is currently housed in the city's museum. It describes a government held by sixty Consuls- initially twenty each for everyone of the original ethnic communities, thereafter fifteen for each district - remaining in office for six months. The leading member of the Council and chief of Treviglio was the Chancellor (Cancelliere), similar to an actual mayor. This statute also required that no noble could be allowed to live within the city walls - and therefore to be elected Consul - so as to prevent their possible involvements in the power strives of the town and the town involvement in their struggles for power.
In 1395 Treviglio gained formal autonomy from the Empire, which it held as a ""Separate Land of the Duchy of Milan"",  except for several brief Venetian occupations (1431-1433; 1448–1453 and 1499–1509). These occupations are mentioned in The Betrothed, a renowned Italian novel by Alessandro Manzoni. At the last withdrawal in 1509, the city was burnt down by the departing Venetian troops. The French king Louis XII who witnessed the event, claimed to vindicate it in the subsequent Battle of Agnadello.
On 28 February 1522 General Odet de Foix Viscount of Lautrec, leading the French army through Northern Italy on its way to the South, came to punish the town for the insolence shown by denying supplies to the French troops and resisting them. The chronicles tell that the consuls of the city realised there was no chance of resisting the French army. Thus, they marched barefoot and with a rope at the neck to the General, offering the keys of the city and their lives in order to spare the populace. After the general refuse the surrender, the parish priest and the Duke of Milan tried to intercede for the town. The general refused, intended to make of the town a cautionary tale, therefore - so the story - the inhabitants took refuge in the churches because at the time they were supposed to provide legal and religious protection. Finally, when the French troops entered the town without encountering resistance, a fresco of Our Lady in front of which the inhabitants were praying, appeared to weep. 
Warned of this portentous event, the General checked the building and its walls to verify the veracity of the miracle and, finally persuaded, deposed helmet and sword at the feet of the fresco and left the city. Helmet and sword are still preserved in the Sanctuary, built with donations of the Treviglio's families only, and where was transferred the miraculous fresco over which were added, crowns forged with the jewels of the virgins of Treviglio. This act is due to the frequency of rape occurring during sieges and sackings. Even if not left pregnant, it was very difficult for raped women to find a husband. This episode is celebrated every year with a re-enactment, an historical parade and a novena (nine days of prayers). A popular song about the event is still sang in the town during those days.
After many long years of war, the French sold Treviglio to the Spaniards, albeit the town was formally still under the aegis of the Holy Roman Empire.
During this last domination the town as well as the whole region, knew an initial period of prosperity followed by a gradual decline, aggravated in the 17th century by an epidemic of plague.
The Spanish period ended transforming Treviglio in fief and auctioning it off to meet the debts of the Duchy [ of Milan ], but the town people fiercely opposed the measure and, after losing a lawsuit against the Senate of Milan, self-taxed themselves to buy the fief and its independence.
After the French Revolution in 1796, Treviglio became part of the Transpadane Republic, the following year of the Cisalpine Republic and, in 1805, of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy. It was during these years that many of the religious buildings were looted and a detailed official map of the town was drawn. Amusingly, the name of some streets include dialectal words because the French officers couldn't distinguish them names during the surveys. For example, ""Via d'Iser"" (in Italian, ""street of Iser""), which was misspelled from ""di ser"", has Iser as a name while ""di"" means ""of"" and ""ser"" is the vulgar name of the tree Quercus cerris. Thus, in dialect it meant ""street of the Quercus cerris trees"".
The local dialect - like almost everywhere in Lombardy - preserves words and sounds, reminiscent of the frequent French occupations.
After the Congress of Vienna the town was included in the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia, then temporarily attached to the Kingdom of Sardinia during the first Italian War of Independence and, finally, the town joined the Kingdom of Italy in 1860.
On 17 December 1915 Benito Mussolini married in civil union Rachele Guidi in Treviglio,  after the future Duce had recovered in the local hospital.
With a Presidential Decree of 8 January 1960,  Treviglio was declared a City, as promised by King Victor Emanuel II in 1860, due to its historical involvement in the achievement of the Italian Independence.
Survived family names dating back to Treviglio are Bornaghi, Facchetti, Butinone (and variants), Carioli, Gatti (and variants), Manenti and Rozzoni.
Others, like Aresi, Cortesi, Conti, Colombo, Merisi and Monzio Compagnoni; are widespread, but originate from neighbouring villages or others places. For instance, Merisi is from Caravaggio and Aresi from Brignano Gera d'Adda. Colombo instead was the surname given to abandoned orphans in the Duchy of Milan.

== Economy ==
Agriculture and trade were prominent in the economy of Treviglio from its beginning to today and, until the 20th century, there was a flourishing craft sector producing furniture and silk; then the swift industrial development and the relocation of that production made way to the mechanical (in particular the SDF, Bianchi bicycles), electrical and chemical industries which are still active.
The flow of the necessary capital for the establishment of new local enterprises, promoted the growth of the local bank, BCC (Credit Union) and of insurances agencies.
During the economic crisis many local enterprises were forced to close or were acquired by larger companies and their production transferred to Eastern Europe or Asia. The local bank undertook an expansion effort that weakened it and the local government focused on the development of services, tourism and trade.
The town attracts people from the surrounding villages with its services, while the Old Town boasts artisan food shops, cafes and fashion shops which are very appreciated.

The town hosts two historical museum, two picture gallery, one scientific museum and two tiny natural protected areas.
All cultural activities are led by several historical and scientific associations.
There are two local newspapers, Il popolo cattolico (Catholic people) and Il Giornale di Treviglio (Treviglio's Journal).
There are at least three linguistic centres; seven kindergartens (both public and private); ten elementary schools (both public and private); four junior high schools (both public and private) and thirteen senior high schools (both public and private), including lyceums and technical schools, offering 23 different courses of study.

Asmund and Signy,"Asmund and Signy is an Icelandic fairy tale published by Scandinavist Josef Calasanz Poestion in Islandische Märchen.  Andrew Lang included it in The Brown Fairy Book.


== Synopsis ==
A king and queen had a son, Asmund, and a daughter, Signy.  Asmund loved the outdoors.  He persuaded his father to give him two giant oaks, and told Signy that he would hollow them out and live in them. Signy asked to live there, too, and Asmund agreed.  They lived there a time, when their father had to go to war, and their mother died...
Nearby, a king had a son, Prince Ring, who had heard of Signy's beauty and was determined to marry her.  When setting out in search for her, he met a beautiful woman who told him she was Signy and explained her being alone on the way as stemming from her grief at her mother's death; she was, in fact, a gigantic witch.  He told her he wished to marry her.  She agreed but said she had to go into the woods and would join him at the ship.  In the woods, she tore up the two oaks and carried them with her.  Ring carried her home, where she was made welcome, and the oaks were planted outside her windows.
The prince asked her when they could marry, she agreed to a date, and he brought her fine cloth to make her wedding gown.  As soon as he left, she took on her own shape and raged, because she could not sew and would soon starve if her brother did not bring her raw meat and bones.  A giant brought her meat, but she still raged over the cloth.
Asmund asked Signy to sew the cloth, because otherwise they would have no peace.  Signy did so, and Ring was pleased with the clothing.  But the witch continued to rave about her food.  Finally, Asmund brought Ring to listen to her plans after the wedding:  slaughtering the courtiers and bringing her relatives, the giants, to court.  Ring burned down the house with both her and her brother in it. 
Ring fell in love with Signy at sight, and Asmund with Ring's sister, so they had a double wedding, and Asmund returned with his bride to his father's kingdom.


== Analysis ==


=== Tale type ===
In his 1987 study of folktales, folklorist D. L. Ashliman classified the tale as type AaTh 870B*, ""The True Bride Sews a Wedding Dress"". In Stith Thompson's revision of the international Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index, he classified the tale as type 870B*, ""Princess Sews for False Bride"", and listed 8 variants in Iceland.

Hōjō Sadayuki,"Hōjō Sadayuki (北条 貞将, 1302 – July 4, 1333) was a Japanese samurai lord of the late Heian period. He was the son and heir apparent of Hōjō Sadaaki, the 15th Shikken of the Kamakura Shogunate. There is a theory that he was the 17th Shikken of the shogunate. He was defeated and killed during the Siege of Kamakura in 1333.


== Life ==
Sadayuki was born in 1302, the eldest son of Hōjō Sadaaki, the 15th Shikken of the Kamakura Shogunate.In 1318, Sadayuki became a member of the Council of State (hyōjōshū), and served as hikitsuke goban tōnin. At this time, he also married an unidentified woman. He held the court rank of Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade and was Provisional Captain of the Right Division of Bureau of Horses (uma no gon no kami).In 1324, when the Shōchū Rebellion broke out, Sadayuki became Rokuhara Tandai Minamikata and entered Kyoto with 5,000 cavalrymen. After this, he investigated the situation in Kyoto as the Shikken Tandai. After just three days from his arrival, he was already putting out a fire that began at Rokujō Bōmon Inokuma.In 1329, Sadayuki was promoted from Governor of Echigo Province to Governor of Musashi Province. The same year, his father Sadaaki began making arrangements for his son, and Sadayuki resigned from the post of tandai and left Kyoto in 1330. Upon his arrival in Kamakura, he was appointed hikitsuke ichiban tōnin.Sadayuki fought Nitta Yoshisada during the Siege of Kamakura. In 1333, when Yoshisada conducted a rise to arms at Ikushina Shrine in Nitta Manor, Kōzuke Province in response to the escape of Emperor Go-Daigo, Sadayuki travelled to Shimokōbe Manor in Shimōsa Province as the shogunal army general. Although he organized his forces at Mutsu'ura Manor, he was defeated at Tsurumi River by Yoshisada's forces led by his cousin Chiba Sadatane and Oyama Hidetomo, and was forced to retreat to Kamakura.According to Taiheiki, Sadayuki's military had declined to 800 men due to continuous warfare, and because Sadayuki himself was wounded in seven places, he retreated to Tōshō-ji, the family temple of the Hōjō clan, and said his last goodbye to Tokusō Hōjō Takatoki. It is said that at this time, Takatoki rewarded Sadayuki for his loyalty and he was given the posts of ""both tandai"" and Governor of Sagami Province. Before Sadayuki returned to the battlefield, he wrote: ""It will be a memory that takes to the underworld."" On July 4, 1333, he attacked Yoshisada's forces and was killed along with his son Tadatoki and many members of the Kanazawa Hōjō family.Sadayuki's death has been described heroically in Taiheiki. According to the description, he wrote ""I give away a life of a hundred years and the nation repays a favor of one day"" on the back of his migyosho book with large characters, set it up in his armor, charged into a large enemy army and died. It is said that both the enemies and the allies were deeply impressed by it.

According to Taiheiki, Hōjō Takatoki rewarded Sadayuki by appointing him to the posts of ""both tandai"" and Governor of Sagami Province. However, Sadayuki was hikitsuke ichiban tōnin at the time, and he had previously served as Rokuhara Tandai; this ""reward"" was equivalent to a demotion, and the only possible promotion could have been to the post of Shikken. Therefore, ""both tandai"" in Taiheiki may not refer to Rokuhara Tandai, but refers to Shikken and Rensho. Because the post of Shikken was vacant due to the death of Hōjō Moritoki, and because most shikken were appointed to Governor of Sagami Province after having previously served as Governor of Musashi Province, it has been theorized that Sadayuki had been the 17th Shikken.

Old Sacramento State Historic Park,"Old Sacramento State Historic Park occupies around one third of the property within the Old Sacramento Historic District of Sacramento, California.  The Old Sacramento Historic District is a U.S. National Historic Landmark District.  The Historic District is sometimes abbreviated as Old Sacramento, or Old Sac,  and since the 1960s has been restored and developed as a significant tourist attraction.


== History ==
The city of Sacramento grew up in the mid-nineteenth century as a development from Sutter's Fort.  However, the Fort was some distance from the Sacramento River, which was the main means of transport to the coast of California, and the area that would become the modern city developed along the waterfront.
Before Sacramento's extensive levee system was put in place, the area flooded quite regularly. Because of this, the city's streets were raised a level. Most of the sidewalks and storefronts have been filled in; however, many tunnels still remain throughout Old Sacramento and the downtown area.
By the 1960s, the area had fallen into disrepair and disrepute. A large effort was made to secure the area's future as an outdoor living history center similar to Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia. Several historically significant buildings were moved or reconstructed. Those that were beyond repair were demolished.Today, the Old Sacramento Historic District covers the area between the river frontage and Interstate 5, between I Street and the Capitol Mall. The State Historic Park comprises about a third of the total acreage of the district including half of the waterfront, a large grassy area and railroad features.  Virtually all the buildings in this area date from the 19th century, the most notable dating back to the period immediately after the disastrous fire of 1852, and show a reasonable approximation of their original appearance, though they have required varying degrees of reconstruction to restore to them to that state.  However, few, if any, still serve their original purpose; most of them now house restaurants, gift shops, or other businesses catering to tourists.Old Sacramento State Historic Park attracts over 5 million visitors annually. Regular events include the Sacramento Music Festival (formerly known as the Sacramento Jazz Jubilee), Gold Rush Days, New Year's Eve events, the St. Patrick's Day Parade, the World Music and Dance Festival and Mardi Gras.


== Architecture ==
While the architecture from this period is commonly attributed to Victorian gold miners, characteristics of West End, such as multi-storied buildings, large arched doorways, full-height balcony windows and the use of decorative wrought-iron balconies, were most ubiquitous in parts of Spain and the Spanish colonies. This influence may be attributed to the fact that the period of Spanish, then Mexican, rule in California enjoyed immigration from all over the Atlantic, including Spain and the Canary Islands, and the Spanish colonies.The architecture of Old Town Sacramento (formerly known as West End) exhibits observable characteristics similar to that of San Juan (Puerto Rico), Havana (Cuba), Tampico (Mexico), Seville (Spain), Santa Cruz de Tenerife (Canary Islands) and Madrid (Spain).While the architectural style of Old Sacramento, with its wrought iron balconies and evenly spaced full-height windows may remind one of Paris, Sacramento's oldest buildings predate the Haussmann Projects that renovated large areas of Paris in that style.


== Historic buildings ==
Notable buildings include:

B. F. Hastings Building, the National Historic Landmark western terminal of the Pony Express and the first location of the California Supreme Court; also housed the office of the Alta California Telegraph Company; features a branch of the Wells Fargo History Museum
Big Four House, a National Historic Landmark building constructed through the joint efforts of California's railroad pioneers: Collis Huntington, Mark Hopkins, Leland Stanford and Charles Crocker, known as The Big Four.

Morse Building - Dr. John Frederick Morse, Sacramento's pioneer doctor.


== Memorials ==
The district contains many memorials to the founders of the city and of the California and transcontinental railroad and other transport systems, including the Theodore Judah monument and the Pony Express Statue.


== Current attractions ==
Old Sacramento is the site of the California State Railroad Museum, the California State Military Museum, the Sacramento History Museum, the Wells Fargo History Museum and the Old Sacramento Interpretive Center.
Other attractions available for visitors include rides in horse-drawn carriages, historic trains from the former Central Pacific Railroad passenger station, and cruises on historic riverboats.  A historic sternwheel riverboat, the Delta King, is moored in the river and serves as a hotel, restaurant and theater.  Riverfront Park, located north of J Street, allows access to the water's edge.
The Sacramento Valley Rail Station is just a short walk away from Old Sacramento.


== Interpretive programs ==
The Old Sacramento Historical Foundation manages several programs to highlight the history of the city, including historical reenactments by costumed docents, as well as tours of Old Sacramento's underground level. During October, there is also a special Halloween themed ghost tour.
Every Labor Day weekend, Old Sacramento holds its annual Gold Rush Days. During this time, the paved streets are covered with several tons of dirt and automobile traffic is barred from the area. Old Sac's regular corps of costumed docents is supplemented by extra volunteers and professional reenactors to recreate life in Sacramento as it was in the mid to late 1800s.

Pat Sullivan (American football),"Patrick Joseph Sullivan (January 18, 1950 – December 1, 2019) was an American professional football player and college coach. An All-America quarterback for the Auburn Tigers, he won the Heisman Trophy in 1971 and then played six seasons in the National Football League (NFL) with the Atlanta Falcons and Washington Redskins. Sullivan was a head football coach at Samford University, a position he held from 2007 to 2014. He was previously the head football coach at Texas Christian University (TCU) from 1992 to 1997 and the offensive coordinator at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) from 1999 to 2006. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1991.


== College career ==
Born in Birmingham, Alabama, Sullivan began his athletic career as a three-sport star at Birmingham's John Carroll Catholic High School. Although a talented baseball and basketball player, he chose to play football for Auburn University where he would become the starting quarterback in 1969 under the tutelage of head coach Ralph Jordan. Over the next three seasons, the 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m) tall and 190 lb (86 kg; 14 st) Sullivan would break school and NCAA records for passing while leading the team to a 26–7 record. In 1970, he led the NCAA in total offense with 2,856 yards and set an NCAA record for most yards per play with 8.57. In his career, he was responsible for 72 touchdowns (54 passing/18 rushing) to tie the NCAA record. In his senior season, Sullivan completed 162 passes on 281 attempts for 2,012 yards and 20 touchdowns. This performance was enough to edge out Ed Marinaro for the 1971 Heisman Trophy. Also an excellent student, Sullivan was named an Academic All-American and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in business administration in 1972. Sullivan finished his college career with 6,284 passing yards and 54 touchdowns, along with another 18 touchdowns on the ground. He was selected to play in the Senior Bowl, where he led the South to victory over the North and was given the game's Most Valuable Player award.


== Professional career ==
After college, Sullivan had a six-season professional NFL football career. He was a second-round selection (40th overall pick) of the 1972 NFL Draft by the Atlanta Falcons. Sullivan played with the Falcons from 1972 to 1975. He played in 30 games. In 1974, Sullivan started three games for the Atlanta Falcons, losing all three. He completed 48 of 105 passes and one touchdown. In 1975, he threw for 3 touchdowns, completing 28 of 70 passes. He signed with the Washington Redskins as a free agent in 1976 but was cut before the start of the season.  He signed with the Chicago Bears in March 1977 but was sold to the San Francisco 49ers in June, and then cut by the 49ers before the start of the 1977 season.  Sullivan left football to enter private business in Birmingham, where he worked in insurance and as a tire company executive.


== Coaching career ==
Sullivan spent five seasons doing radio color commentary for Auburn football games before joining the staff at Auburn in 1986 as quarterbacks coach under head coach Pat Dye. He worked with Auburn quarterbacks Jeff Burger, Reggie Slack, and Stan White during his six years at Auburn. During his time as an assistant Auburn won, or shared, three Southeastern Conference championships and had a four-game winning streak against archrival Alabama.
On January 2, 1992, Sullivan became the 27th head football coach of Texas Christian University. He inherited a team still reeling from probation imposed by the NCAA in 1986. Most seriously, the Frogs had been limited to 25 scholarships in 1987 and 1988. By the time Sullivan arrived in Fort Worth, the sanctions had taken their full effect; TCU would not have a full complement of scholarships until 1993.
After two losing seasons, he led TCU to a 7–5 mark in 1994 to win a share of the Southwest Conference championship, the school's first SWC title since 1959. Following the 1994 season, prior to the Horned Frogs' appearance in the Independence Bowl versus Virginia, Sullivan agreed to become the head coach at Louisiana State University (LSU). However, LSU refused to pay the $400,000 buyout of Sullivan's TCU contract, and the Tigers hired Vanderbilt University coach Gerry DiNardo three days later.
The next season produced another winning record of 6–5 before TCU joined the Western Athletic Conference in 1996 and fell once again on hard times. Losing seasons in 1996 and 1997 resulted in Sullivan's resignation in October 1997 with an overall record of 24–42–1. However, he is best known for having recruited LaDainian Tomlinson to play at TCU.
In January 1999, Sullivan became the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach of UAB. He helped develop Darrell Hackney into the best quarterback in UAB history who was able to make it to the NFL as an undrafted free agent picked up by the Cleveland Browns. UAB's offense also featured wide receiver Roddy White, who later played for the Atlanta Falcons.
After neck surgery in September 2003, Sullivan was diagnosed with throat cancer by Dr. William R. Carroll (squamous cell carcinoma) and began chemotherapy and radiation treatments in December. In April 2004, doctors told him he was clear of cancer, but he continued to be monitored for recurrence. Sullivan missed only one game coaching in the 2003 season due to treatment, but lost around 50 pounds over the course of his cancer treatment.
On December 1, 2006, Sullivan was named head coach at Samford University, replacing Bill Gray. In 2008, the Bulldogs joined the Southern Conference and won the championship in 2013. He resigned after the 2014 season, his eighth season as coach.


== Personal life ==
Sullivan was married to the former Jean Hicks of Birmingham and they had three children – Kim, and twins Kelly and Patrick, Jr.


== Death ==
Pat Sullivan died on December 1, 2019, after a long battle with cancer. On January 1, 2020, Auburn players wore ""7"" decals on the left side of their helmets during the Outback Bowl to commemorate Sullivan. 


== Honors and awards ==
Sullivan was selected to the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame, class of 1981. In 1988, he was also a charter member of the Senior Bowl Hall of Fame. The football field house at Samford University was renamed in his honor. In 2016, Sullivan's High School Alma Mater renamed the John Carroll High School Football Field in honor of Pat Sullivan.

List of people who have declined or renounced Indian honours and decorations,"The following is an incomplete list of people who have either declined or renounced an Indian honour or decoration. These include recipients of the Bharat Ratna and the Padma awards (Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, Padma Shri), along with other Indian governmental awards. In some instances, the families of an intended posthumous recipient of a national honour have declined the award for various reasons. Since the honours system was instituted in 1954, approximately 50 individuals have either refused or returned their honours, most of which were awarded in the categories of Art and in Literature and Education.The President of India may cancel and annul any honour if the recipient commits any acts of criminal misconduct or otherwise abuses the award. As there are no specific guidelines for otherwise withdrawing a national honour from a recipient, the acts of returning/renouncing an award to register a protest, or refusing an award after an official awards list has been published, are only symbolic actions. For instance, while independence activist and educationist Asha Devi Aryanayakam refused the Padma Shri after it was conferred upon her in 1954, she remains on the official register of Padma awardees. In 1984, poet and novelist Khushwant Singh, a 1974 Padma Bhushan honoree, returned the honour to protest the Indian army's Operation Blue Star; in spite of this, he remains listed as a Padma Bhushan recipient.


== Bharat Ratna ==


=== Refused the honour (Hridya Nath Kunzru) ===
An Indian freedom fighter and public figure, H. N. Kunzru was nominated for the highest Indian civilian award, the Bharat Ratna, in 1968 but he declined, citing his opposition to such honours in a Republic, which he had first voiced during the Constituent Assembly debates.


=== Refused the honour (Maulana Abul Kalam Azad) ===
Prominent independence movement leader and India's first Minister of Education Maulana Abul Kalam Azad declined the honour, arguing that those who were on selection committees for national honours should not themselves receive them. He received a posthumous Bharat Ratna in 1992.


=== Refusal of posthumous conferment (Subhas Chandra Bose) ===
In 1992, the surviving family of nationalist leader and revolutionary Subhas Chandra Bose, who had died under mysterious circumstances in 1945, were contacted about accepting a posthumous Bharat Ratna on Bose's behalf; however, his family declined the honour, citing the length of time it had taken the government to recognize him.


== Padma Vibhushan ==


=== Refused the honour ===
P. N. Haksar was offered the award in 1973 for, among other services, his crucial diplomatic role in brokering the Indo-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation and the Shimla Agreement, but declined as ""Accepting an award for work done somehow causes an inexplicable discomfort to me.""
E. M. S. Namboodiripad, the former General Secretary of the Communist Party of India (of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) from 1978) and the first Chief Minister of Kerala (1957–59, 1967–69), declined the award in 1992, as it went against his nature to accept a state honour.
Swami Ranganathananda declined the award in 2000 as it was conferred to him as an individual and not to the Ramakrishna Mission.


=== Returned the honour ===
Parkash Singh Badal, a former chief minister of Punjab and a 2015 Padma Vibhushan recipient, returned the honour in December 2020 in support of the 2020–2021 Indian farmers' protests, writing to the President ""I am who I am because of the people, especially the common farmer. Today, when [the farmer] has lost more than his honour, I see no point in holding on to the Padma Vibhushan honour.""


=== Refusal of posthumous conferment ===
In 2011, the family of Lakshmi Chand Jain refused to accept the posthumous honour as Jain was against accepting state honours.


== Padma Bhushan ==


=== Refused the honour ===
Bengali theatre activist Sisir Kumar Bhaduri (1959) was the first awardee who refused his conferment as ""he felt state awards merely help create a sycophantic brigade"" and ""did not want to encourage the impression that the government was serious about the importance of theatre in national life.""

Western Labor Conference,"The Western Labor Conference was a radical Canadian labour convention held March 13-15, 1919, in Calgary. It is known for being the convention at which One Big Union was formally proposed.Two hundred and thirty-nine delegates from five Canadian provinces attended the event. Alberta sent the largest number of delegates at 89, British Columbia sent 85, Manitoba sent 46, Saskatchewan sent 17, and Ontario sent 2. The British Columbia Federation of Labour, which was viewed as the most militant of any of the attending groups of delegates, proposed several resolutions.  They included a six-hour work day, the end of Allied interference in Russia, severance of ties to international unions outside of Canada, the end of the political imprisonment of Canadian citizens, and the acknowledgement of the impediment of labour movements under the capitalist economic system. If these demands were not met by the Canadian government by June 1, 1919, the newly formed One Big Union would call for a general strike. The resolutions concluded with a solidarity greeting addressed to the Russian Bolsheviks and the German Spartacus League. However, they met with opposition from other conference delegates. The more moderate delegates then proposed the idea of polling all registered Canadian trade unionists on the decision to establish One Big Union as well as exiting from the Trades and Labour Congress of Canada and the American Federation of Labor. The motion was defeated. In its place, the conference agreed to form a committee that would familiarize Canadian workers with the concept of One Big Union. The committee consisted of R.J. Johns, W.A. Pritchard, J. Knight, J. Naylor, and V.R. Midgley. The undercover Mountie Frank Zaneth attended as a delegate.

Rijssen,"Rijssen (pronounced [ˈrɛisə(n)]; Dutch Low Saxon: Riesn, pronounced [ˈriːsn̩]) is a city in the Dutch province of Overijssel. It is part of Rijssen-Holten, one of thirteen municipalities in  Twente. It has almost 28,000 inhabitants. The economy of Rijssen relies mostly on commerce and construction and transport companies.


== History ==
Archeological evidence shows that the monk Lebuinus founded a church in Rijssen, as early as the seventh century, as part of a coordinated attempt to convert the local pagan Saxons to Christianity, though other archaeological finds, such as urns and grave mounds suggest habitation dating back as far as 5,000 years.
Rijssen was first mentioned as Parrochia Risnen on a freight letter dating from 1188 by the Count of Dalen.
After having a disagreement with the Viscount of Goor, Bishop Otto III van Holland granted city rights to Rijssen on 5 May 1243. The original city rights bill was lost in a large fire that swept through the town, reducing the town hall and the keep to rubble. In 2006, however, a copy was given to the newly instated town council.
In the 14th century, Rijssen entered the Hanseatic league. Of the old town, only a church and a few houses dating from the eighteenth century remain.
From 1580 to 1584, Rijssen suffered greatly from the Eighty Years' War. The city of Deventer was under the state's command, while the town of Oldenzaal was under Spanish command. The two opposing parties would often meet halfway for battle, around Rijssen.
The 18th century saw the rise of the Industrial Revolution in Rijssen. Many farmers participated in textile manufacturing; whole families, women and children, were involved in this trade, often under poor conditions. In the 19th and early 20th century, Rijssen, like many other towns in the Netherlands, saw the introduction of power looms. This spearheaded the local Ter Horst factory among the regional top jute producers. These however went bankrupt in the 1970s due to overpowering Asian competition. Factory workers were forced to find other means of income and many started their own businesses, either in transport or in construction engineering.
Rijssen was a separate municipality until it merged with Holten in 2001. The working title of the municipality was ""Rijssen"", and it got the final name ""Rijssen-Holten"" in 2003.


== Transport ==
Railway station: RijssenRijssen is easily accessible through a number of provincial roads, such as the N347 and the N350, the latter connects Rijssen to the village of Holten and lends its name to  the local radio station. Through these provincial roads, Rijssen has access to the motorway A1 from Amsterdam to the German border.
All neighbourhoods in Rijssen are easily accessible by bus.


== Facilities/tourism ==
Rijssen has multiple shopping facilities in its centre, which also accommodates a number of bars, pubs and lunchrooms. It has a large discothèque that attracts visitors from all neighbouring towns and villages.
The small town has a fire brigade museum and a monumental church, the Schildkerk. The restored and fully functional mill de Pelmolen is one of the major attractions of the town.
Rijssen is surrounded by a versatile landscape, accommodating a number of renowned camp sites.
Being close to Germany, it is an ideal location for European companies, such as Zwaartransport Twente or ZTT, member of the Van der Vlist group, who are heavy transport specialists, with a focus on moving agricultural equipment.


== Population and politics ==
The inhabitants of Rijssen are known for their pride for their town, their self-sufficiency and working ethos. This pride shows in the fact that Rijssen has its own anthem.
Rijssen has a large community of several Protestant groups, with several churches, as well as a small Roman Catholic parish. The conservative Calvinist  Reformed Political Party (SGP) long held the strongest position in the municipality's council. A large percentage of Rijssen's population are members of one of these conservative groups. Rijssen also has communities of Moluccan, Turkish, Syrian and Moroccan people.


== Language ==
As Rijssen lies in the Dutch Low Saxon language area of Western Europe, and has a rich trading history going back to Heanseatic times, the town has developed a distinct variety of Low Saxon, known as Riessens. It shares many characteristics with Low Saxon dialects of surrounding communities, which are categorised as Tweants, although it has some very distinct characteristics, most notably in pronunciation. Riessens is by some considered one of the more conservative varieties of Tweants, although there are no scientific grounds for this idea.


=== Development ===
A large peat bog to the west of the Tweante region long formed a natural border, separating it from the rest of the Netherlands. Twente was, therefore, more geographically, economically and culturally inclined towards the east, modelling their clothing and speech to Munsterlandic fashion.
As the town of Enschede in the east of Twente became a textile powerhouse during the industrial revolution and the model for fashion and language, Twente gradually severed the old ties with Münster. Enschede attracted people from the entire country, while settlers from the nearby Drenthe and Groningen regions were invited to come and till the eastern parts of Twente. Their dialect features gradually influenced the Munsterlandic traits. Rijssen had its own (smaller-scale) textile industry, which obsoleted their need to look beyond. Additionally, in the 19th century, Rijssen and surrounding villages became largely protestant in an otherwise mainly Roman Catholic region. This caused a cultural rift between the eastern and western parts of Twente. Rijssen, by then becoming more and more conservative and therefore seclusive, developed a few language traits, while retaining some of the old Munsterlandic features that were lost in others.
For instance, the pronunciation of the Riessens word 'weten', which is pronounced /ʋɪətn̩/ (to know) is, despite their different written forms, equal to the Munsterlandic wiäten. In more eastern parts of Tweante, this word has evolved into 'wetten' (pronounced /ʋɛtn̩/).


=== Features ===
Characteristic features include diphthongisation of a number of vowels that are monophthongs in other varieties of Tweants. For instance, in other varieties, the words breef (letter), groot (large), and neuze (nose) are pronounced /bɾef, ɣɾɔːt, nœzə/, whereas in Riessens they are pronounced /bɾeəf, ɣɾɔət, nœəzə/. Older speakers may even be heard pronouncing them /bɾɪəf, ɣɾʊət, nʏəzə/. This phenomenon is known as vowel breaking. This indicates that Riessens is part of the larger Westphalian branch of Low Saxon.
Other features are vowel elongation, and some additional vowels that are absent in other varieties, such as the ASH vowel. Below are few examples:

stemme (voice) - stämme (stems).
IPA: /ˈstemə/ and /ˈstæmə/
veste (vests) - vuste (already) - vuuste (fists) - völs te (much too)
IPA: /ˈvɛstə/ - /ˈvʏstə/ - /ˈvystə/ - /ˈvɜstə/One notable feature that sets Riessens apart from other varieties of Tweants is its sing-song, nasal quality. Due to vowel elongation, combined with syllabic consonants, Riessens has (to some extent) a different rhythm than other varieties, perhaps comparable with North Germanic languages.

Real radical,"In algebra, the real radical of an ideal I in a polynomial ring with real coefficients is the largest ideal containing I with the same vanishing locus.
It plays a similar role in real algebraic geometry that the radical of an ideal plays in algebraic geometry over an algebraically closed field.
More specifically, the Nullstellensatz says that when I is an ideal in a polynomial ring with coefficients coming from an algebraically closed field, the radical of I is the set of polynomials vanishing on the vanishing locus of I. In real algebraic geometry, the Nullstellensatz fails as the real numbers are not algebraically closed. However, one can recover a similar theorem, the real Nullstellensatz, by using the real radical in place of the (ordinary) radical.

Emlen Franklin,"Emlen Franklin (April 7, 1827 – June 19, 1891) was an American politician.
Franklin, the youngest son of Judge Walter Franklin, was born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, on April 7, 1827.  He entered Yale College in 1845 and graduated in 1847.  He read law with Nathaniel Ellmaker, Esq., of Lancaster, and was admitted to the bar in May, 1850. He began immediately the practice of his profession in Lancaster, and in the autumn of 1854 was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, but declined a re-election after having served for one term. From 1859 to 1862 he was District Attorney of Lancaster County. Upon the breaking out of the American Civil War, he volunteered with a militia company of which he was Captain for the three months' service ; and in 1862 raised the 122nd Regiment of Pennsylvania Volunteers, of which he was chosen Colonel, and which he commanded for nine months—the period of its service; during which time he participated in the battles of Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville.  He returned home in May, 1863, and in June, upon the invasion of Pennsylvania by Gen. Robert E. Lee, he raised a regiment of militia, and in command of one of the brigades shared in that campaign.  After the discharge of the troops Col. Franklin resumed the practice of his profession, and during the fall of 1863 was elected Register of Wills of Lancaster County, for a three years' term.  His health was impaired by his service in the army, and he died in Lancaster after a brief closing illness, on June 19, 1891, in his 65th year.
In early life he married a daughter of Michael Withers, of Lancaster, who survived him with two sons and one daughter.

Round dance,"Modern social round dance, or round dancing, is a choreographed and cued ballroom dance that progresses in a circular counter-clockwise pattern around the dance floor. The two major categories of ballroom dances found in round dancing are the smooth and international ballroom styles (such as foxtrot and waltz) and the Latin dances (such as cha-cha-chá, salsa, and rhumba). It is not to be confused with circle dancing, which is a type of folk dance in which dancers are connected in a circular chain.


== Description ==
Round dancing differs from free-style ballroom dancing in that each round dance has been fully choreographed ahead of time, and a ""cuer"" or leader at the front of the ballroom tells the dancers, as they dance, what steps to do. As the music plays, and just ahead of the beat, so the dancers have time to respond, the cuer names each dance figure in the choreography. As a consequence, all the dancers on the floor are dancing the same steps at the same time.
To create a round dance, a piece of music is selected by the choreographer, and the different steps or figures are chosen to fit the music. If the music swells and pauses briefly, then a dance step that rises and stretches is put into that place. If there is a little syncopation in another part of the music, then a quick step is inserted. The creation of a piece of choreography is like engineering a machine, with every gear and lever in just the right place to give smooth and flowing motion. The step-by-step instructions on how to dance this choreography are written out in what is called a cue sheet.


== Types ==
Examples of social dances that may be danced in ""round"" fashion are bolero, cha-cha-cha, foxtrot, hustle, jive,  mambo, merengue, paso doble, quickstep, rhumba, salsa, samba, single swing, slow two step, tango, two step, waltz, Viennese waltz and West Coast swing.
Roundalab, the International Association of Round Dance Teachers, Inc., has established a ""Phase Rating System"" of round dancing, in order to rate round dance figures according to difficulty and complexity.
Salsa rueda, also referred to as casino de rueda, is a kind of round dance in which there is no complete pre-choreographed sequence, and the dance patterns are called out in a random order.

Leros,"Leros (Greek: Λέρος), also called Lero (from the Italian language), is a Greek island and municipality in the Dodecanese in the southern Aegean Sea. It lies 317 kilometres (197 miles; 171 nautical miles) from Athens's port of Piraeus, from which it can be reached by an nine-hour ferry ride or by a 45-minute flight from Athens, and about 20 miles to Turkey. Leros is part of the Kalymnos regional unit. It has a population of 7,988.


== Geography ==
The municipality has an area of 74.172 km2 (28.638 sq mi). The municipality includes the populated offshore island of Farmakonisi (pop. 10), as well as several uninhabited islets, including Levitha and Kinaros, and had a 2011 census population of 7,917, although this figure swells to over 15,000 during the summer peak. The island has a coastline of 71 kilometres (44 miles). It is known for its imposing medieval castle of the Knights of Saint John possibly built on a Byzantine fortress. Nearby islands are Patmos, Lipsi, Kalymnos, and the small islands of Agia Kyriaki and Farmakos. In ancient times it was considered the island of Parthenos Iokallis and linked to the Hellenistic and Roman literature on Meleager and the Meleagrides. The administrative centre and largest town is Agia Marina, with a population of 2,672 inhabitants. Other sizable towns are Lákki (pop. 1,990), Xirókampos (908), Kamára (573), and Álinda (542).


== Transportation ==
The Leros Municipal Airport at Partheni connects the island multiple times a day with Athens (45 minute flight). There are also ferry connections to and from Piraeus and the other islands of the Dodecanese, including the HighSpeed Ferry which connects directly to Mykonos during summer (4 hours). The Catamaran Dodekanisos Express connects Leros with most of the Dodecanese islands. Leros also has a range of connections to other nearby islands with airports, including Kos, Kalymnos, Rhodes and Samos, which are a short boat ride to Leros (1 – 2 hours).


== Traditional music ==
Many local songs of Leros are among the most famous in the traditional (nisiotika) music of Greece, the most celebrated being Pote Tha'nixoume Pania, ""Pos to Trivun to Piperi"", Mes tou Aegeou ta Nisia and Proutzos. Lerikos is the name of the local dance; also noteworthy is the Issos dance. The most loved instruments in the island are Tsampouna (τσαμπούνα), lyra (λύρα) and violin.


== Food ==
Leros is famous for its local food and sweets. Traditionally, this was due to the range of seabound trade that connected Leros to most other islands of the Eastern Mediterranean, and parts of Asia Minor and North Africa, guaranteeing fresh produce and a range of recipes and styles that made Leros cuisine unique. In more modern times, the Italian occupation led to Leros adding an Italian style to its cuisine, whereby now many restaurants in Leros provide a unique mix of Lerian, Greek and Italian restaurants, dishes and cooking styles. Some of the more unique offerings of Leros include gavafes, a unique tropical fruit that grows only in Leros, mizithra, a local hard, salty cheese often cured in the sediment of red wine, Kolios Pastos, mackerel cured in sea salt, Lerian Thyme honey, a particularly flavourful honey derived from the thyme-filled hills of Leros, Pougkakia, a Lerian dessert offered at weddings (but commonly available in the many sweets shops in Leros), Patsavouropita (a cake with layers of filo and syrup) and Soumada, a sweet drink made of almonds.


== History ==


=== Antiquity ===
Thucydides stressed the special importance of the bays and the harbours of Leros during the Peloponnesian War (431 BC – 404 BC), where Leros supported the democratic Athenians. After the end of the war, Leros came under the sovereignty of the Spartans. The island had a famous sanctuary of the greek goddess Artemis.It then followed the fate of the rest of the Dodecanese Islands during the years of Alexander the Great and his successors, the Roman years and the Byzantine period. After the division of the Roman Empire, Leros was part of the Byzantine Empire. On the island of Farmaco east from Leros, a few miles from Didyma on the Turkish coast, Julius Caesar was held as a hostage by local pirates for forty days.


=== Venetian and Ottoman Era ===
During the Byzantine Age, the island was incorporated into the Theme of Samos. During the thirteenth century, the island was occupied by the Genoese and then by the Venetians. In the year 1309, the Knights of St John seized and fortified Leros. In 1505, the Ottoman Admiral Kemal Reis, with three galleys and seventeen other warships, besieged the castle but could not capture it. The operation was repeated in 1508 with more ships, but again nothing was achieved.
Legend has it that then the island was rescued by the only surviving knight, barely 18 years old. He dressed women and children in the armor of the dead defenders, convincing the Ottomans that the garrison of Leros was still strong. Finally, on 24 December 1522, following the siege of Rhodes, a treaty was signed between Sultan Suleiman and the Grand Master of the Knights, Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam, and Leros, along with all the Aegean possessions of the Order, passed into Ottoman hands which ruled the island with brief interruptions during a period of four hundred years.
During the Ottoman rule, and along with the other islands, Leros enjoyed a privileged regime, with partial autonomy and self–government. During the Greek Revolution of 1821, the island was liberated and became an important base for the re-supplying of the Greek Navy. Administratively, it came under the jurisdiction of the Temporary Committee of the Eastern Sporades.

With the Treaty of London, on 3 February 1830, however, which determined the borders of the newly established Greek state, the freed islands of the Eastern Sporades were given over to the Ottoman Empire again. According to the Ottoman General Census of 1881/82-1893, the kaza of Leros had a total population of 6.754, consisting of 6.623 Greeks, 18 Muslims and 113 foreign citizens. In the ""Diary of the Prefecture of the Archipelago"" of 1886, Leros, along with the islands of Patmos, Lipsos and Fournoi, belonged to the Ottomans. The island's administrative council was made up of both Greeks and Turks.


=== The Italian Period ===
In 1912, during the Libyan War against the Ottoman Empire, Italy occupied all of the Dodecanese islands (except Kastelorizo). On May 12, 1912, the island was seized by the sailors of the Italian Navy cruiser San Giorgio. The Greek inhabitants of the islands declared the autonomy of the islands under the title ""The Aegean State"", with the aim of unification with Greece, but with the outbreak of the First World War, these moves came to nothing, and Italy retained control of the islands.

From 1916 to 1918, the British used Leros as a naval base. In the Venizelos–Tittoni agreement of 1919, the island was to be returned to Greece, along with all of the Dodecanese except Rhodes, but after the Greek defeat in the Greco-Turkish War, Italy canceled the agreement. As a result, the Treaty of Lausanne confirmed the Italian possession of Leros and the Dodecanese.
The new Italian Fascist regime actively attempted to Italianize the Dodecanese, by making the Italian language compulsory, giving incentives to locals to adopt Italian nationality, and clamping down on Greek institutions.
During the 31 years that the Italians remained in Leros, they set up a great plan to build and fortify the island, since its strategic position and its large natural harbours (the largest of which, Lakki, is the largest deepwater harbour in the Mediterranean Sea), made it an ideal naval base. The fortification of Leros and the creation of a major naval base ensured that the Italians had control over an area of vital interest to the Allies (the Aegean, the Dardanelles and the Near East). Mussolini, who called Leros ""the Corregidor of the Mediterranean"", saw the island as a crucial base for the Italian domination of the eastern Aegean Sea.


==== Portolago/Lakki ====

In the 1930s a new model town and major naval base, Portolago, was built by the Italian authorities. It is one of the best examples of Italian Rationalist architecture. Mussolini was said to have a mansion for himself in the town.
After Leros was transferred to Greece, it was renamed Lakki.


=== World War II ===

From 1940, when Italy entered the Second World War on the side of Germany, Leros suffered bombing raids by the British, including Port Laki, on 26 November 1940, by the Royal Navy (Fleet Air Arm) - Swordfish aircraft of 815 and 819 Squadrons, operating from HMS Illustrious. As a result of the excellent anchorage provided to warships by the many natural coves, the island was the second most bombed during World War Two (after Crete). On 8 September 1943, as Italy could not continue the war on the German side, it signed an armistice and came over to the Allied camp. After the Italian armistice, British reinforcements arrived on Leros and other Dodecanese islands and the island suffered continuous German aerial bombardment. One of the largest attacks was on the Greek Navy's flagship, the Vasilissa Olga, sunk by German bombers on Sunday, September 26, 1943, along with HMS Intrepid, while they were anchored in Portolago. The island of Leros was finally captured by German troops during Operation Taifun in airborne and amphibious assaults between 12–16 November 1943. The forces involved were paratroop units and a battalion from the elite Brandenburg division. The ground troops were supported by bombers of the Luftwaffe. Among them I. and II. group of Stuka-Wing 3. I. Group operated from Megara Air Base. The island remained under German occupation until the end of the war.
The 1957 novel and subsequent 1961 film The Guns of Navarone by Alistair MacLean was contextually based on the Battle of Leros.


=== Post-war history ===
After the Germans evacuated the island, Leros came under British administration until 7 March 1948 when Leros, together with the other Dodecanese Islands, was united with Greece. During the post-war years, the Greek government utilized numerous buildings in Leros for various reasons. In 1959, the mental hospital of Leros was founded in Lepida. During the junta of the Colonels, the island was used as a place of internal exile for political dissenters, with old Italian barracks of the island used as an internment camp.

During the dictatorship period of Greece (1967-1974), 4,000 political prisoners were exiled in the same spaces of the mental hospital which were used as a concentration camp. In 1989, Leros came to Europe-wide attention as a result of a scandal involving embezzlement of funds and the maltreatment of about 3,000 mental patients at the mental hospital on the island. Funding from the government led to a rapid and substantial improvement in conditions. A June 2009 BBC report suggests these improvements have not all been sustained.In December 2015, during the European migration crisis, the Greek Government along with the Alternate Migration Policy Minister (Ioannis Mouzalas) and the Mayor of Leros (Michalis Kolias), decided to build a refugees’ reception centre. The camp is termed a “hotspot” and is able to shelter up to 1,000 individuals. The presence of asylum-seekers on Leros is controversial. Greek locals have attacked and harassed asylum-seekers and humanitarian aid workers alike.The hotspot of Leros is located near the mental hospital which has been internationally known as “Europe's guilty secret”, as coined in an Observer article.
 In the same space of Lepida (after almost 15 years of implementing deinstitutionalisation programmes financed by EU), about 200 patients are still accommodated in small rehabilitation structures.

Stephen A. Mitchell (psychologist),"Stephen A. Mitchell (July 23, 1946 – December 21, 2000) was an American clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst.  His book with Jay Greenberg, Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory (1983), became a classic textbook in graduate schools and post-graduate institutions, providing a general overview and comparison of several psychoanalytic theories. He was considered a leader of relational psychoanalysis. Mitchell helped to create the Relational Track of the New York University Postdoctoral Program in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis.


== Biography ==
Stephen A. Mitchell was born on July 23, 1946, in Manhattan to Stanley Mitchell, an accountant, and Lilian, a legal secretary. Mitchell grew up in Ridgefield and later Bergenfield, New Jersey. His brother, Richard, was born when Stephen was five. The family was ""Jewish, secular, and very involved in political and intellectual issues"". Mitchell would excel at school and later go to Horace Mann High School in New York City, where his peer and future friend Thomas Ogden also studied.Eventually, Mitchell entered Yale University and majored in an interdisciplinary honours program, ""History: the Arts and Letters"". He graduated summa cum laude, and subsequently trained as a clinical psychologist at the New York University doctoral program. He was trained as an analyst at the William Alanson White Institute from 1972 to 1977. His training analyst was Miltiades Zaphiropoulos.After a first brief marriage, Mitchell married Margaret Black in 1976, who had been his internship colleague at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. Together, they raised two daughters, Caitlin (b. 1983) and Samantha (b. 1986).Mitchell died of heart failure at his home in Manhattan on December 21, 2000. His final book, published posthumously and entitled Can Love Last?, was an application of relational theory to love relationships.


== Work ==


=== Ideas ===
Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory distinguished between psychoanalytic theories that emphasize biological drives such as sexuality and aggression, on the one hand, and theories that emphasize human relationships, on the other.  The former were referred to as drive/conflict theories, and the latter were termed relational/conflict theories.  Mitchell and Greenberg argued that drive theories and relational theories are conceptually incompatible, and psychoanalysis must therefore choose between them. After their book, the ideas of Mitchell and Greenberg diverged. While Greenberg would go on to espouse the concept of the drive, Mitchell instead chose to develop a theory of relationality through engagements with Fairbairn, Loewald, and Bowlby. Mitchell recognized the importance of Greenberg's work, while keeping a critical distance to the latter.


=== Institution ===
Mitchell also established the international psychoanalytic journal, Psychoanalytic Dialogues in 1990 and served as one of its editors for the journal's first ten years from 1990 to 2000.  After the publication of his first book, with Greenberg, he was in great demand, and taught his ideas across the United States, Europe, and Israel.
In addition to his scholarly contributions, Mitchell was also involved in political and institutional questions relating to psychoanalytic training and formation. He was instrumental in developing a number of psychoanalytic organizations, including the American Psychological Association's Division of Psychoanalysis, the Relational Track of the New York University Postdoctoral Program in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis, and a variety of other groups.

Tropic Electric,"Tropic Electric is the second studio album by the Canadian/Jamaican singer Kreesha Turner. It was released on November 15, 2011, digitally and physically. Kreesha decided to release it as a double disc, one side Tropic, and the other 'Electric'. The 'Tropic' side was recorded in Jamaica, to capture a new type of genre, a mix of reggae and pop music. The 'Electric' side of the album is dedicated to fans who enjoyed the vibe on her previous album, Passion.
The album received mostly positive reviews, praising its Jamaican sound, but criticizing tracks 'I Feel My Darling', and 'Come My Way'.
The iTunes track listing was mislabeled, the track reading 'Killer In The Club' is actually '8 A.M.', and vice versa.


== Singles ==
The first single from the album, ""Rock Paper Scissors"", was released on July 5, 2011. For unknown reasons, only the radio edit of the track appears on the album.
The second single, ""I Could Stay"", was released on October 24, 2011. The iTunes single only contains the radio edit, but the full version of the song can be heard on the album. The song peaked at 59 on the Canadian Hot 100. ""I Could Stay"" was noted by critics for referencing and sounding similar to Janet Jackson's ""Runaway"". On Sunday, February 5, 2012, Kreesha confirmed through her Mobile Backstage iPhone app that she had just finished shooting the music video for the third single off the album in Montreal. The third and last single on the album was the second track on the electric side of the album, the Shawn Desman produced 'Love Again'.

Comollo,"Comollo is an Italian surname  localized in the northern regions of Piedmont and Liguria. There are about one hundred families listed in the Italian phonebook under this surname. It is considered the Piedmontese form of the more common surname Comolli, which is mostly localized in the Lombardy region. The surname Comollo is also present in the United States, with about 50 families.


== Etymology ==
Comollo has an etymology in common with other similar forms of the surname, such as: Comotto, Cometti, Cominetti, Comoglio, Comelli, Comino. According to the Dizionario ragionato dei cognomi (Annotated Dictionary of Surnames) by Frangipane, Comollo is the truncated and endearing form from the proper name Giacomo (Jacob): Gia→como→comollo. It is less probable that it is a toponymic from Como, because there are many similar surnames that maintain the original stem, such as: Giacomino, Giacomelli, Giacomolli, Giacometti, Jacobellis, Jacobacci and so on.

Capt. George Scott House,"The Capt. George Scott House, also known locally as the Octagon House and the Collar Box House, is an historic octagon house on Federal Street in Wiscasset, Maine.  Built in 1855, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 23, 1972.


== Description and history ==
The Scott House stands on the east side of Federal Street, overlooking the Sheepscot River to the east, a short way north of the center of Wiscasset.  It is a 2+1⁄2-story masonry structure, built out of brick with sandstone trim.  A single wood-frame ell extends to the rear of the house, toward the river, where it is joined to a barn that appears to be 5/8 of an octagon.  The main block is covered by an eight-sided roof with an octagonal cupola at its center, with extended eaves adorned with modillions.  The main entrance faces the street, and is sheltered by a porch supported by four chamfered square posts and covered by a modillioned roof.  Windows are set in rectangular openings, with small single-pane windows in the upper half-story that have rounded corners.  The interior retains many original features, and remnants of others, such as a part of a dumbwaiter used to bring food from the original basement kitchen to the dining room.The house was built in 1855, and was inspired by the work of Orson Squire Fowler, who promoted the design and construction of octagon houses, resulting in a construction fad in the 1850s and 1860s.  It was built for George Scott, a Wiscasset native and successful ship's captain.  A later resident was Edith Augusta Sawyer, an author of children's books.

Liam Devaney,"Liam Devaney (1935 – 15 August 2017) was an Irish hurler. His league and championship career with the Tipperary senior team spanned fourteen seasons from 1954 until 1968.Born in Borrisoleigh, County Tipperary, Devaney was born into a strong hurling family. His father, Jim Devaney, was a stalwart of the Borris–Ileigh club and was a member of the Tipperary senior panel that won the All-Ireland title in 1937.
Devaney first came to prominence as a hurler at underage levels with the Borris-Ileigh club before making his debut with the club's adult team in 1952. In a 22-year club career he won a county senior championship medal in 1953, as well as four divisional senior championship medals.
Devaney made his debut on the inter-county scene at the age of sixteen when he was selected for the Tipperary minor team. He enjoyed two undefeated championship seasons in this grade, winning back-to-back All-Ireland medals in 1952 and 1953. He was added to the Tipperary senior panel during the 1954 championship before making his debut during the 1954-55 league. Over the course of the following fourteen seasons Devaney became one of Tipperary's most versatile players and won five All-Ireland medals, beginning with a lone triumph in 1958, followed by four championships in five seasons between 1961 and 1965. He also won eight Munster medals, eight National Hurling League medals and was named Hurler of the Year in 1961. He played his last game for Tipperary in October 1968 and played senior hurling for Tipperary in every position except full back.
After being chosen on the Munster inter-provincial team for the first time in 1956, Devaney subsequently became an automatic choice on the starting fifteen between 1961 and 1966. During that time he won three Railway Cup medals.


== Playing career ==


=== Club ===
Devaney played his club hurling with Borris–Ileigh and enjoyed much success in a career that spanned three decades. He made his senior championship debut in 1952 at a time when the club's first great era was coming to an end. In spite of this, Devaney won a county senior championship medal in 1953, following a 4-8 to 4-4 defeat of Boherlahan. He also won four divisional senior championship medals between 1952 and 1972, before retiring from club hurling in 1974.


=== Minor ===
After having his presence requested for trials for the Tipperary minor team in early 1952, Devaney was an automatic choice at right wing-forward for the subsequent championship campaign. Tipperary won each of their three provincial games with ease, with Devaney winning his first Munster medal following a 10-7 to 1-2 defeat of Clare in the final. The subsequent All-Ireland series provided little difficulty for Tipperary, with the team scoring 18 goals in their games against Galway and Dublin. The 9-9 to 2-6 defeat of Dublin in the decider gave Devaney his first All-Ireland medal.
Devaney was eligible for the minor grade once again in 1953, with Tipperary dominating the championship for the second successive season. After an impressive provincial campaign, Devaney won a second Munster medal following a 3-11 to 3-3 defeat of Limerick. For the second year in succession, Dublin provided the opposition in the All-Ireland final. Tipperary completely outclassed the Metropolitan once again, and an 8-6 to 3-6 victory gave Devaney a second All-Ireland medal.


=== Senior ===


==== Early successes ====
After being a substitute on the Tipperary senior team for the 1954 championship, Devaney made his senior debut during the 1954-55 league, a campaign which saw Tipperary face Wexford in the final. Wexford's preparation for the game was affected by the death of Bob Rackard, father of the legendary brothers Nicky, Bobby and Billy, who had all withdrawn from the match. Tiperary won the game by 3-5 to 1-5, with Devaney claiming his first league medal. He added a second league medal to his collection in 1957 following a defeat of Kilkenny, however, Devaney was still waiting for championship success.
In 1958 Devaney won his first Munster medal from the substitutes' bench as Tipperary regained the provincial crown following a 4-12 to 1-5 trouncing of reigning champions Waterford. Tipperary later defeated Kilkenny in the All-Ireland semi-final before lining out against Galway in the All-Ireland decider on 7 September 1958. Galway got a bye into the final without picking up a hurley. Devaney, Donie Nealon and Larry Keane all scored goals for Tipperary in the first-half, while Tony Wall sent a seventy-yard free untouched to the Galway net. Tipperary won the game by 4-9 to 2-5 giving Devaney his first All-Ireland medal.Devaney won a third National League medal in 1959 following a 0-15 to 0-7 defeat of Waterford, however, Tipperary subsequently surrendered their provincial and All-Ireland crowns.
Tipperary asserted their dominance in 1960 by retaining the National League title with a 2-15 to 3-8 defeat of Cork. It was Devaney's fourth winners' medal in that competition. He later won a second Munster medal - his first on the field of play - following a narrow 4-13 to 4-11 defeat of Cork in what has been described as the toughest game of hurling ever played. This victory allowed Tipperary to advance directly to an All-Ireland final meeting with Wexford on 4 September 1960. A certain amount of over-confidence was obvious in the Tipperary camp, particularly in trainer Phil Purcell's comment that no player was capable of marking Jimmy Doyle. The game ended in remarkable circumstances as the crowd invaded the pitch with a minute to go, mistaking the referee's whistle for the end of the game. When the crowd were finally moved off the pitch Tipperary continued playing with only twelve men, but Wexford won on a score line of 2-15 to 0-11.


==== Total dominance ====
1961 saw Devaney collect a fifth National League medal following a 6-6 to 4-9 defeat of Waterford. He later added a third Munster medal to his collection, as old rivals Cork were downed by 3-6 to 0-7. The absence of the All-Ireland semi-final allowed Tipperary to advance directly to the final itself, with Dublin's first native hurling team providing the opposition on 3 September 1961. The game was a close run thing, however, Tipperary held on to win by 0-16 to 1-12. It was Devaney's second All-Ireland medal. He ended the year by being named Caltex Hurler of the Year.
In 1962 Tipperary were still the kingpins of Munster. A 5-14 to 2-3 trouncing of Waterford in the decider gave Devaney a fourth Munster medal. Tipperary's nemesis of two years earlier, Wexford, waited in Croke Park to test them once again in the subsequent All-Ireland final on 2 September 1962. Wexford, however, were not the force of old and the side got off to possibly the worst start ever by a team in a championship decider. After just ninety seconds the Leinster champions were down by two goals, however, the game turned out to be much closer than people expected. Tipperary eventually secured the win on a score line of 3-10 to 2-11, giving Devaney a third All-Ireland medal.
After losing the following year's Munster final to Waterford in one of the hurling shocks of the decade, Tipperary bounced back in 1964 with Devaney collecting a sixth National League medal. Tipperary later cantered casually past Cork by fourteen points in the provincial decider, giving Devaney a fifth Munster medal, albeit from the substitutes' bench. The All-Ireland final on 6 September 1964 saw Kilkenny enter the game as firm favourites against Devaney's side. John ""Mackey"" McKenna scored Tipperary's first goal after ten minutes as the Munster champions took a 1-8 to 0-6 interval lead. The second half saw Tipperary score goals for fun, with Donie Nealon getting a hat-trick and Seán McLoughlin another. Kilkenny were humiliated at the full-time whistle as Tipperary triumphed by 5-13 to 2-8. It was Devaney's fourth All-Ireland medal.
In 1965 Devaney won a sixth National League medal as New York were narrowly defeated on an aggregate score of 6-19 to 5-20. Tipperary demolished all opposition in the provincial championship once again and a 4-11 to 0-5 trouncing of Cork gave Devaney a sixth Munster medal. Wexford were Tipperary's opponents in the subsequent All-Ireland final on 5 September 1965, however, the game failed to live up to the two classic games between the two sides in 1960 and 1962. Victory went to Tipperary on that occasion by 2-16 to 0-10, courtesy of a brace of goals by Seán McLoughlin. The win gave Devaney a fifth All-Ireland medal.


==== Decline ====
After surrendering their provincial crown in 1966, Tipperary bounced back the following year, with Devaney winning a seventh Munster medal following a 4-12 to 2-6 defeat of Clare. 3 September 1967 saw Kilkenny face Tipperary in the All-Ireland decider, and Devaney's side looked like continuing their hoodoo over their near rivals as they took a 2-6 to 1-3 lead at half-time. Goalkeeper Ollie Walsh was the hero for Kilkenny as he made a series of spectacular saves, however, the team lost Eddie Keher and Tom Walsh to injury in the second half. In spite of this, Kilkenny laid to rest a bogey that Tipperary had over the team since 1922, and a 3-8 to 2-7 victory resulted in defeat for Devaney's team.Devaney won an eighth National League medal as a member of the panel in 1968 as New York were defeated on an aggregate score of 6–27 to 4–22. Tipperary retained their status as provincial kingpins once again and a 2–13 to 1–7 trouncing of Cork gave Devaney an eighth Munster medal. For the fourth time of the decade, Wexford were Tipperary's opponents in the subsequent All-Ireland final on 1 September 1968. At half-time it looked as if Tipperary were cruising to another victory as they took an eight-point lead. Just after the restart Wexford had a Christy Jacob goal disallowed before Tony Doran scored a goal after just six minutes. Tipperary fought back, however, it was too late as Wexford won by 5–8 to 3–12. In spite of this setback, Devaney finished the year with a sixth Oireachtas Cup medal following a narrow 1-9 to 1-6 defeat of Cork, before retiring from inter-county hurling.


=== Inter-provincial ===
Devaney also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial hurling competition.  He captured Railway Cup titles in 1961, 1963 and 1966.


== Personal life ==
Devaney was born to Jim and Josie Devaney (née McShery) in Borrisoleigh, County Tipperary in 1935. He was educated locally and later worked as a salesman with Killough Quarries.Devaney died on 15 August 2017 at the age of 82 after a short illness. He was survived by his wife Hannie and six children.

Rineloricaria,"Rineloricaria (from the Greek, rhinos meaning nose, and the Latin, lorica meaning cuirass of leather) is a genus of freshwater tropical catfish (order Siluriformes) belonging to the family Loricariidae. They are commonly called whiptail catfish because of the long filament that grows out of the tip of the caudal fin that is characteristic of the genus. With the exception of R. altipinnis from Panama, they are native to the rivers of northern and central South America. Some species are regularly seen in the aquarium trade.


== Taxonomy ==
This genus was described by Pieter Bleeker in 1862, with R. lima as the type species. This genus is by far one of the most speciose of the subfamily Loricariinae, containing about 30 species. On the other hand, it is one of the least resolved genera. In 2008, 14 new species were added to this genus.Hemiloricaria, Fonchiiichthys, and Leliella been variably considered synonyms of Rineloricaria; these genera were erected to account for differences in sexually dimorphic traits. However, the traits used to diagnose these genera have been thought to be insufficient.


== Species ==

== Distribution and habitat ==
The genus is widely distributed on nearly the entire subcontinent, from Costa Rica to Argentina, on both slopes of the Andes. Rineloricaria species are found in a large variety of habitats, including large rivers, streams, and lagoons, associated with bottoms consisting of sand or rocks, sometimes found in marginal vegetation. They are also found to tolerate environments with a wide temperature gradient. Rineloricaria have an adaptive capacity enabling many species to exploit the most varied habitats; some species, such as R. strigilata, have been caught in highly polluted bodies of water and represent some of the main components of the ichthyological diversity in such habitats.


== Appearance and anatomy ==
The average length of a Rineloricaria catfish is about 13 cm (5 in) long. The fish are long, slender, have no visible barbels, an erect dorsal fin, a very thin caudal peduncle, and a narrow face. The coloration of the fishes is usually light brown with darker blotches, and have a dark dorsal fin. They are also covered with bony plates and have a sucker disk mouth, as is common with most fish in the family Loricariidae.


== Reproduction ==
Sexual dimorphism includes hypertrophied development of the odontodes along the sides of the head, on the pectoral spines and rays, and predorsal area of mature males. Several species also show hypertrophied development of the odontodes on the entire caudal peduncle. In males, the pectoral fin spine is often thick, short, and curved when compared to the female. Rineloricaria are cavity brooders. Numerous eggs (often more than 100) are laid attached to one another in single layer masses on the cavity floor, and are brooded by males. Rineloricaria exhibit high levels of karyotypic diversity with chromosome numbers ranging from 36 to 70.

Monostroma kuroshiense,"Monostroma kuroshiense, a green alga in the division Chlorophyta, is a green seaweed endemic to Kuroshio Coast of Japan. This high-value seaweed is called Hitoegusa or Hirohano hitoegusa (ヒロハノヒトエグサ) in Japanese. Previously this algae was known in binomen Monostroma latissimum, but the latest scientific research based on multilocal phylogeny discovered that this is a new species. The algae is named after Kuroshio Current, naming is done by phycologist Felix Bast This algae is commercially cultivated in East Asia and South America for the edible product ""hitoegusa-nori"" or ""hirohano-hitoegusa nori"", popular sushi wraps. Monostroma oligosaccharides with degree of polymerization 6 prepared by agarase digestion from Monostroma nitidum polysaccharides have been shown to be an effective prophylactic agent during in vitro and in vivo tests against Japanese encephalitis viral infection. The sulfated oligosaccharides from Monostroma seem to be promising candidates for further development as antiviral agents. The genus Monostroma is the most widely cultivated genus among green seaweeds.


== Description ==


== Distribution ==
The distribution endemic to Japanese Kuroshio Coast.


== Ecology ==
It is found in intertidal rocks of saline and estuarine environments with various seawater salinities (35 to 24 PSU).


== Life history ==
A number of peer-reviewed scientific literature exists on the ecophysiology of this algal genus. Natural and cultivated sexually reproducing environmental samples, as well as sexually reproducing and serendipitously discovered asexually reproducing ecotypes of monostromatic green alga from Tosa Bay, Japan are conspecific (belong to the same species). Patterns of seasonal fluctuations in its thallus lengths were habitat specific and recur annually. Both appearance and decay of thalli were earlier at high saline habitats, suggesting that salinity positively influences either maturation of sporophytes or senescence of gametophytes. Results from life cycle, thallus ontogeny, gametangial ontogeny and phylogenetic analyses suggest that this algal genus is evolutionarily affiliated in order ulotrichales. Type of life cycle is not a valid diagnostic character for the species circumscription in Monostromataceae.


== Uses ==
This is an edible green algae extensively used as nori in sushi.

Mount Richthofen,"Mount Richthofen is the highest summit of the Never Summer Mountains range of the Rocky Mountains of North America.  The prominent 12,945-foot (3,946 m) peak is located 5.6 miles (9.0 km) northwest by west (bearing 308°) of Milner Pass, Colorado, United States, on the Continental Divide separating the Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness in Rocky Mountain National Park and Grand County from Routt National Forest and Jackson County.  The mountain was named in honor of pioneering German geologist Baron Ferdinand von Richthofen, apparently by Clarence King's 1870 survey team.


== Mountain ==
Needles and Grenadiers explorer William S. Cooper climbed Mount Richthofen by himself in 1908 in what is presumed to be the first ascent in historic times by Americans of European descent. No sign of previous climbers were present at that time.Today, the mountain is typically climbed from Lake Agnes to the north, easily reachable from Cameron Pass. The mountain is a steep Class 3 climb that often requires travel on steep scree slopes that are not very stable.


== Climate ==
According to the Köppen climate classification system, the mountain is located in an alpine subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and cool to warm summers. Due to its altitude, it receives precipitation all year, as snow in winter, and as thunderstorms in summer, with a dry period in late spring.

Manuel Lucena,"Manuel 'Manolo' Lucena Medina (born 18 November 1982) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a central defender.
His professional career was mainly associated with Granada, with which he competed in all four major levels of Spanish football.


== Club career ==
Lucena was born in Granada, Andalusia. In 2002 he joined hometown's Granada CF, at the time in Tercera División. After two years as a starter he signed for Marino de Luanco in Segunda División B, being first-choice in his only season as the Asturias club narrowly avoided relegation.
In the summer of 2005, Lucena moved to Sporting de Gijón in Segunda División. In January of the following year, after only three league appearances – seven minutes in total – he returned to Granada, being an essential defensive unit and scoring five goals as the team promoted from the fourth level.
In the following three division three campaigns, Lucena remained a key player for Granada, never appearing in less than 32 league games and occasionally pitching in at defensive midfielder. In 2009–10, already as team captain, he contributed with 26 matches and one goal en route to a return to the second division after 22 years.
In late June 2011, after a second consecutive promotion for Granada, with him as the club's only player from the region of Granada, Lucena renewed his contract for a further two seasons. He made his La Liga debut on 27 August in a 0–1 home loss against Real Betis (90 minutes played), but featured in only nine official contests over the course of two seasons combined, being released subsequently.
Lucena retired at the end of the 2013–14 campaign at the age of 31, after 12 competitive appearances with CD Mirandés in the second level. In February 2015 he returned to Granada, as match delegate.

Wallace Triplett,"Wallace Triplett (April 18, 1926 – November 8, 2018) was a professional American football player, the first African-American draftee to play for a National Football League team. For that reason, his portrait hangs in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio.


== Early life ==
Triplett, the son of a postal worker, was born and raised in the Philadelphia suburb of La Mott, Pennsylvania, part of Cheltenham Township. His reputation as a talented high school football player, combined with his upscale address, prompted the University of Miami to offer him a scholarship sight unseen, under the assumption Triplett was white. The then-segregated university rescinded the scholarship when they discovered Triplett was black. Triplett instead earned a Senatorial Scholarship for his academics and chose to attend Penn State University in the fall of 1945.


== Penn State ==
Along with Dennis Hoggard, Triplett was one of the first African-Americans to take the field in a varsity football game for the Penn State Nittany Lions. During the 1946 season, the Penn State team voted to cancel a regular-season game in Miami against the Miami Hurricanes, rather than compromise by not bringing their black players. (Miami, like other southern schools at the time, refused to compete against integrated schools unless they left their black players at home.)In 1948, Triplett became the first African-American to play in the Cotton Bowl Classic, catching the tying touchdown in Penn State's 13–13 tie with Southern Methodist University.Triplett also co-founded the Gamma Nu chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha while at Penn State. Triplett returned to Penn State on November 11, 2015, to meet with head coach James Franklin and the team after their bye-week scrimmage.


== NFL ==
Although Triplett was the third African-American chosen in the 1949 NFL Draft, he was the first of the draftees to take the field in a league game. Undrafted ""free agent"" African-Americans had previously played in the league. The 5'-10"", 173-pound running back and return specialist played for the Detroit Lions from 1949 to 1950.
On October 29, 1950, in a game against the Los Angeles Rams, Triplett set the Lions' single-game record for kickoff return yardage with 294 yards, the third-highest total (NFL record is 304 yards) in NFL history, including a 97-yard touchdown return. He accomplished this despite only returning four kicks, which gives him the single-game all-time NFL record for average yards-per-return (min. three returns).


== Later life and death ==
Following the 1950 season, Triplett became the first NFL player drafted into military service for the Korean War. When he returned from active duty, the Lions traded him to the Chicago Cardinals. He retired from professional football in 1953. After his playing days, Triplett worked as a teacher, in the insurance business, and in management for the Chrysler Corporation. Triplett died on November 8, 2018, at age 92.

Reading South (UK Parliament constituency),"Reading South was a borough constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elected one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. The constituency covered an area in and around the town of Reading in the county of Berkshire.


== History ==
The Reading South parliamentary constituency was first created for the 1950 general election by splitting the previous parliamentary constituency of Reading into North and South divisions. These constituencies were merged back into a single Reading constituency in for the 1955 general election.
The Reading South constituency was recreated in 1974, when the majority comprised areas outside the County Borough. In 1983 the constituencies in Reading were reorganised, creating the new constituencies of Reading East and Reading West.


== Boundaries ==


=== 1950–1955 ===
The County Borough of Reading wards of Church, East, Katesgrove, Minster, Redlands, and West.It was then abolished and absorbed into the re-established constituency of Reading, with the exception of the East ward, which was transferred to Wokingham.

The seat was contested and won for the Labour Party by Ian Mikardo, the sitting MP for the Reading constituency, who held the seat until it was merged back into a single Reading constituency for the 1955 general election.
The Reading South constituency was recreated in 1974, when it was contested and won for the Conservative Party by Gerard Vaughan, the sitting MP for the Reading constituency. For the 1983 general election the constituencies in Reading were reorganised, creating the new constituencies of Reading East and Reading West. Gerard Vaughan went on to hold the Reading East constituency until he stood down at the 1997 general election.

The Boat That Rocked,"The Boat That Rocked (titled Pirate Radio in North America) is a 2009 British comedy-drama film written and directed by Richard Curtis about pirate radio in the United Kingdom during the 1960s. The film has an ensemble cast consisting of Philip Seymour Hoffman, Bill Nighy, Rhys Ifans, Nick Frost and Kenneth Branagh. Set in 1966, it tells the story of the fictional pirate radio station ""Radio Rock"" and its crew of eclectic disc jockeys, who broadcast rock and pop music to the United Kingdom from a ship anchored in the North Sea while the British government tries to shut them down. It was produced by Working Title Films for Universal Pictures and was filmed on the Isle of Portland and at Shepperton Studios.
After the world premiere in Leicester Square on 23 March 2009, the film was released theatrically in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 1 April 2009. It was a commercial failure at the British box office making only US$10.1 million in its first three months, just a fifth of its US$50 million production cost. It received mixed reviews and criticism for its length. For its North American release, the film was cut by 20 minutes and retitled Pirate Radio. Opening on 13 November 2009, it earned only $8 million in the US. When the worldwide theatrical run was finished in January 2010, the film had grossed US$36.6 million.


== Plot ==
In 1966, various pirate radio stations broadcast to the United Kingdom from ships in international waters, specialising in rock and pop music not played on BBC Radio. Seventeen-year-old Carl, recently expelled from school, is sent to stay with his godfather Quentin, who runs the station Radio Rock anchored in the North Sea. The eclectic crew of disc jockeys and staffers, led by brash American DJ ""The Count"" and DJ ""Doctor Dave"".
In London, government minister Sir Alistair Dormandy resolves to shut down pirate radio stations for their commercialism and immorality, instructing his subordinate Twatt to pursue legal stratagems to accomplish this. They attempt to cut off the pirates' revenue by prohibiting British businesses from advertising on unlicensed stations. Quentin counters by bringing massively popular DJ Gavin Kavanagh out of retirement on Radio Rock, enticing advertisers to pay their bills from abroad. Gavin's popularity creates a rivalry with The Count.
Carl becomes smitten with Quentin's niece Marianne, but is heartbroken when she is seduced by Doctor Dave, while DJ ""Simple"" Simon Swafford marries glamorous fan Elenore in an onboard ceremony, but learns that she only married him to be near Gavin. The Count challenges Gavin to a game of chicken in defence of Simon's honour: The stubborn rivals climb the ship's radio mast to a dangerous height, but reconcile after they are both injured jumping into the ocean.
Marianne arrives to apologise to Carl for sleeping with Dave, and she and Carl have sex. The following morning, the DJs announce news of the coupling to cheering fans across Britain. Shortly after, Carl's mother Charlotte visits for Christmas, and denies that Quentin is his father. Carl gives her a cryptic message from reclusive late-night DJ ""Smooth"" Bob Silver, unexpectedly revealing that Bob is his father.
Meanwhile, Dormandy's vendetta against pirate radio advances when Twatt finds news of a fishing boat whose distress call was blocked by Radio Rock's powerful signal. Twatt proposes the creation of the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act 1967, making pirate radio stations illegal on the grounds that they endanger communication with other vessels. Despite heavy public support for the pirate stations, the Act passes unanimously through Parliament and takes effect at midnight on 1 January 1967.
The Radio Rock crew defy the law and continue broadcasting, firing up the ship's engine to evade arrest. The aging vessel's engine explodes, and the ship sinks. The DJs broadcast their position in hope of aid, and Twatt appeals to Dormandy to send rescue boats, but Dormandy refuses. Carl saves the oblivious Bob from his cabin while The Count vows to broadcast as long as possible.
With the lifeboats inoperable, the crew gather on the prow as the ship goes down. They are rescued by dozens of fans in a fleet of small boats, with Carl being saved by Marianne. The Radio Rock ship disappears beneath the sea, with the Count emerging at the last moment.


== Cast ==

Additional minor roles were played by Ian Mercer as the transfer boatman, Stephen Moore as the Prime Minister, Michael Thomas and Bohdan Poraj as Dormandy's subordinates Sandford and Fredericks, Olegar Fedoro as the Radio Rock ship's captain, and Olivia Llewellyn as Marianne's friend Margaret and Felicity's love interest. Giovanna Fletcher plays one of the bridesmaids to Elenore.


== Production ==


=== Development ===
The film was written and directed by Richard Curtis and made by Working Title Films for Universal Studios. The producers for Working Title were Tim Bevan, Eric Fellner and Hilary Bevan Jones, with Curtis, Debra Hayward and Liza Chasin acting as executive producers. Principal photography started on 3 March and continued until June 2008. Filming took place on the former Dutch hospital ship Timor Challenger, previously De Hoop, moored in Portland Harbour, Dorset; the ""North Sea"" scenes were shot off the coast of Dunbar, East Lothian. Boat interior shots were filmed inside a warehouse in Osprey Quay on the Isle of Portland and at Shepperton Studios. They also visited Squerryes Court in Kent to shoot the scenes of the home of government minister Alistair Dormandy (Kenneth Branagh). The film's production cost exceeded £30 million. It was also filmed on HMS Victory.


=== Historical setting ===

The official synopsis of The Boat That Rocked before release stated that it tells the fictional story about a group of DJs in 1966 who are at odds with a traditionalist British government that prefers to broadcast jazz. According to director Richard Curtis, the film, though inspired by real British pirate radio of the 1960s, is a work of historical fiction and does not depict a specific radio station of the period.


== Release ==


=== North American release ===
Following the film's commercial failure at the British box office, Focus Features commissioned a re-edited version for release in North American release 13 November 2009. Retitled Pirate Radio, this version of the film deleted approximately twenty minutes of footage from the original version to address complaints from several critics that the film's running time was excessive. Upon the release of Pirate Radio in the United States, Manohla Dargis wrote:
Stuffed with playful character actors and carpeted with wall-to-wall tunes, the film makes for easy viewing and easier listening, even if Mr. Curtis, who wrote and directed, has nothing really to say about these rebels for whom rock 'n' roll was both life's rhyme and its reason.
Robert Wilonsky, reviewing Pirate Radio after having seen The Boat That Rocked and its UK home video release, said the U.S. theatrical release had had ""most of its better bits excised""; according to Wilonsky, ""after watching the DVD, Pirate Radio feels so slight in its current incarnation. Shorn of the scenes that actually put meat on its characters' frail bones, the resulting product is vaguely cute and wholly insubstantial, little more than a randomly assembled hodge-podge of scenes crammed in and yanked out that amount to yet another movie about rebellious young men sticking it to The Grumpy Old Man—this time, with a tacked-on Titanic climax.""
The marketing campaign for the film's North American release was notable for embellishing the nature of the movie, as well as the historical setting. Trailers had a prominent voice-over announcement stating that ""in 1966 the British government banned rock 'n' roll on the radio. Until one American DJ and a band of renegades launched a radio station on the high seas and raided the air waves."" In the film, pirate radio transmissions were widespread before Parliament passed the Marine Offences Act, including the station portrayed on the film.
The trailer in North America also featured dialog from a scene not in the release; chief among which were a British government minister was being told in a voiceover that the American deejay ""The Count"" is ""possibly the most famous broadcaster ever,"" which wasn't borne by the actual plot. The trailer and commercials also displayed prominent text that stated ""inspired by a true story,"" which was not claimed by either the production or writing staff.


== Reception ==
The film received mixed reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gave it a score of 59% based on 167 reviews. The Daily Telegraph credited the film with ""some magical moments,"" but called it ""muddled"" and criticised its length. Time Out was also critical of the length and said the film was ""disappointing.""  The Hollywood Reporter ran the headline ""Rock 'n' roll movie Boat just barely stays afloat,"" declaring the film too long to sustain interest. Total Film also criticised the film's length and comedic style. Andrew Neil, writing in The Observer, remarked that he was disappointed in the ""contrived"" storyline and the ""unnecessarily perverted"" history. Channel 4 said the film was ""touching,"" ""heartfelt"" and an ""enjoyable journey"" but questioned its coherence. 
The film's British box office revenues in its first 12 weeks of release were £6.1 million, less than a quarter of its production cost.In United States, the film earned less than US$3 million in its first weekend (in a mid-scale release of 882 screens as opposed to 3,404 screens for 2012 and 3,683 screens for A Christmas Carol) and suffered a 49.7% drop-off on its second weekend, earning only US$1.46 million. The film took about US$8 million (approximately £5 million) in North America.


== Soundtrack ==

The soundtrack features songs from The Kinks, The Rolling Stones, The Turtles, Jimi Hendrix, Duffy, Procol Harum, Box Tops, The Beach Boys, Dusty Springfield, The Seekers and The Who.
The soundtrack features 32 songs on two discs. The film itself has a 60-song playlist.


== Home media ==
Scenes cut from the film but available in at least some of the film's home media releases include:
A long scene of late-night sabotage aboard a competitor's vessel;
The Count's homage to the Beatles, delivered in front of Abbey Road studios;
Gavin Kavanagh in a flashback, dancing in a Latin American bar to ""Get Off of My Cloud"";
A heartbroken ""Simple"" Simon lip syncs Lorraine Ellison's ""Stay with Me"" in its entirety.
Midnight Mark ""entertains"" about 30 naked women who are part of a large group of fans that visit the ship.

Slow light,"Slow light is the propagation of an optical pulse or other modulation of an optical carrier at a very low group velocity. Slow light occurs when a propagating pulse is substantially slowed by the interaction with the medium in which the propagation takes place.
Group velocities below the speed of light in vacuum c were known to be possible as far back as 1880, but could not be realized in a useful manner until 1991, when Stephen Harris and collaborators demonstrated electromagnetically induced transparency in trapped strontium atoms. Reduction of the speed of light by a factor of 165 was reported in 1995. In 1998, Danish physicist Lene Vestergaard Hau led a combined team from Harvard University and the Rowland Institute for Science which realized much lower group velocities of light. They succeeded in slowing a beam of light to about 17 meters per second. In 2004, researchers at UC Berkeley first demonstrated slow light in a semiconductor, with a group velocity 9.6 kilometers per second. Hau and her colleagues later succeeded in stopping light completely, and developed methods by which it can be stopped and later restarted.In 2005, IBM created a microchip that can slow light, fashioned out of fairly standard materials, potentially paving the way toward commercial adoption.


== Background ==
When light propagates through a material, it travels slower than the vacuum speed, c. This is a change in the phase velocity of the light and is manifested in physical effects such as refraction. This reduction in speed is quantified by the ratio between c and the phase velocity. This ratio is called the refractive index of the material. Slow light is a dramatic reduction in the group velocity of light, not the phase velocity. Slow light effects are not due to abnormally large refractive indices, as will be explained below.
The simplest picture of light given by classical physics is of a wave or disturbance in the electromagnetic field. In a vacuum, Maxwell's equations predict that these disturbances will travel at a specific speed, denoted by the symbol c. This well-known physical constant is commonly referred to as the speed of light. The postulate of the constancy of the speed of light in all inertial reference frames lies at the heart of special relativity and has given rise to a popular notion that the ""speed of light is always the same"". However, in many situations light is more than a disturbance in the electromagnetic field.
Light traveling within a medium is no longer a disturbance solely of the electromagnetic field, but rather a disturbance of the field and the positions and velocities of the charged particles (electrons) within the material. The motion of the electrons is determined by the field (due to the Lorentz force) but the field is determined by the positions and velocities of the electrons (due to Gauss' law and Ampère's law). The behavior of a disturbance of this combined electromagnetic-charge density field (i.e. light) is still determined by Maxwell's equations, but the solutions are complicated because of the intimate link between the medium and the field.
Understanding the behavior of light in a material is simplified by limiting the types of disturbances studied to sinusoidal functions of time. For these types of disturbances Maxwell's equations transform into algebraic equations and are easily solved. These special disturbances propagate through a material at a speed slower than c called the phase velocity. The ratio between c and the phase velocity is called the refractive index or index of refraction of the material (n). The index of refraction is not a constant for a given material, but depends on temperature, pressure, and upon the frequency of the (sinusoidal) light wave. This latter leads to an effect called dispersion.
A human eye perceives the intensity of the sinusoidal disturbance as the brightness of the light and the frequency as the color. If a light is turned on or off at a specific time or otherwise modulated, then the amplitude of the sinusoidal disturbance is also time-dependent. The time-varying amplitude does not propagate at the phase velocity but rather at the group velocity. The group velocity depends not only on the refractive index of the material, but also the way in which the refractive index changes with frequency (i.e. the derivative of refractive index with respect to frequency).
Slow light refers to a very low group velocity of light. If the dispersion relation of the refractive index is such that the index changes rapidly over a small range of frequencies, then the group velocity might be very low, thousands or millions of times less than c, even though the index of refraction is still a typical value (between 1.5 and 3.5 for glasses and semiconductors).


== Preparation ==
There are many mechanisms which can generate slow light, all of which create narrow spectral regions with high dispersion, i.e., peaks in the dispersion relation. Schemes are generally grouped into two categories: material dispersion and waveguide dispersion. Material dispersion mechanisms such as electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), coherent population oscillation (CPO), and various four-wave mixing (FWM) schemes produce a rapid change in refractive index as a function of optical frequency, i.e., they modify the temporal component of a propagating wave. This is done by using a nonlinear effect to modify the dipole response of a medium to a signal or ""probe"" field. Dispersion mechanisms such as photonic crystals at red and blue edges, coupled resonator optical waveguides (CROW), and other micro-resonator structures modify the spatial component (k-vector) of a propagating wave. Slow light can also be achieved by exploiting the dispersion properties of planar waveguides realized with single negative metamaterials (SNM) or double negative metamaterials (DNM).A predominant figure of merit of slow light schemes is the Bandwidth-delay product(BDP). Most slow light schemes can actually offer an arbitrarily long delay for a given device length (length/delay = signal velocity) at the expense of bandwidth. The product of the two is roughly constant. A related figure of merit is the fractional delay, the time a pulse is delayed divided by the total time of the pulse. Plasmon induced transparency – an analog of EIT – provides another approach based on the destructive interference between different resonance modes. Recent work has now demonstrated this effect over a broad transparency window across a frequency range greater than 0.40 THz.


== Potential use ==
Optical switches which make use of slow light in photonic crystals could produce faster data transmission in fiber optic cables, while having significantly lower power requirements. Slow light can also be used to control delays in optical networks, permitting more orderly traffic flow. In addition, slow light can be used to build interferometers that are far more sensitive to frequency shift than conventional interferometers. This property can be used to build better, smaller frequency sensors and compact high resolution spectrometers. Other potential applications include optical quantum memory.


== In fiction ==
The description of ""luminite"" in Maurice Renard's novel, Le maître de la lumière (The Master of Light, 1933), might be one of the earliest mentions of slow light.
These window panes are of a composition through which light is slowed down in the same way as when it passes through water. You know well, Péronne, how one can hear more quickly a sound through, for example, a metal conduit or some other solid than through simple space. Well, Péronne, all this is of the same family of phenomena!
Here is the solution. These panes of glass slow down the light at an incredible rate since there need be only a relatively thin sheet to slow it down a hundred years. It takes one hundred years for a ray of light to pass through this slice of matter! It would take one year for it to pass through one hundredth of this depth.
Subsequent fictional works that address slow light are noted below.

The slow light experiments are mentioned in Dave Eggers's novel You Shall Know Our Velocity (2002), in which the speed of light is described as a ""Sunday crawl"".
On Discworld, where Terry Pratchett's novel series takes place, light travels only a few hundred miles per hour due to Discworld's ""embarrassingly strong"" magic field.
""Slow glass"" is a fictional material in Bob Shaw's short story ""Light of Other Days"" (Analog, 1966), and several subsequent stories. The glass, which delays the passage of light by years or decades, is used to construct windows, called scenedows, that enable city dwellers, submariners and prisoners to watch ""live"" countryside scenes. ""Slow glass"" is a material where the delay light takes in passing through the glass is attributed to photons passing ""...through a spiral tunnel coiled outside the radius of capture of each atom in the glass."" Shaw later reworked the stories into the novel Other Days, Other Eyes (1972).
""Slow Light"" (2022) is a short film made by Kijek/Adamski with two animation techniques. It's a story of a boy who is born blind and suddenly at the age of seven sees a light. A medical examination reveals that his eyes are so dense that it takes seven years for the light to reach the retina and hence for the image to reach his consciousness.The consequence of the eye defect translates into the mental immaturity of the man, lack of understanding of the present and belated reflections on long-gone facts. The man is never mature enough for his age and constantly lingers on the past.

Nataraja Guru,"Nataraja Guru (born P. Natarajan, 18 February 1895 – 19 March 1973) was a disciple of Narayana Guru. Nataraja Guru founded Narayana Gurukula on 1923 for the integral study of various wisdom approaches.


== Biography ==
Nataraja Gúrú was born in Bangalore in British India on 18 February 1895. His mother was Bhagavathi Amma and his father, Palpu, was a doctor who founded the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (Society for the Propagation of the Religion of Sree Narayana, or SNDP) in 1903, of which Sree Narayana Guru was the first president. Natarajan was the third of five children, having both an older and younger brother and an older and younger sister. He received a high-class education in Bangalore, Trivandrum and Kandy before being awarded a Master's degree by Madras Presidency College.Natarajan had come into contact with Narayana Guru and experienced the gurukul way of life in Alwaye and Ooty before becoming headmaster at Varkala High School, which had been founded by Naryana. It was after a ""conference of all religions"" at Alwaye that Natarajan founded his Narayana Gurukulam Movement (NGM) and University for the Science of the Absolute in 1924. K. K. N. Kurup, a historian of Kerala, describes the NGM as ""an international order of brotherhood"".In the year that  Sree Naryana Guru Great Samadi , 1928, Natarajan received his blessing to study abroad. These studies lasted five years, during which he obtained a doctorate of letters from the Sorbonne in Paris while also teaching at the Quaker International School in Geneva.On returning to India, Natarajan spent two years seeking work in various parts of the country because the followers of Narayana were not welcoming to him after the guru's death. In 1935, he returned to the gurukul at Fernhill in Ooty. He spent some time as an Advisor for the princely state of Cochin and established an educational institute in Mysore State before leaving India for Europe once again in 1949. Upon his return in 1951, having also visited America, he was recognised as a guru.Thereafter, Nataraja travelled widely around the world and, in 1963, established the Brahmavidya Mandiram at Sivagiri in Varkala. He translated into English and wrote commentaries on all the major works of Narayana Guru. He also wrote on a wide variety of subjects, employing throughout a protolinguistic or structural approach.Nataraja Guru Samadi on 19 March 1973 at the NGM headquarters in Varkala.

"Childs, Maryland","Childs is an unincorporated community in Cecil County Maryland, United States.


== Etymology ==
Childs was originally known as Spring Hill.Childs is named after George W. Childs, an owner of the Philadelphia Public Ledger. In 1886, Childs purchased the Marley Paper Mills to support his newspaper operations.


== History ==
A train station called ""Childs Station"" opened in 1886 on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad line.  Until 1949, passenger trains stopped at Childs, but during ts last few years the station only handled freight, most of it going to and from the Elk Paper Company.In 1893, the Lancaster, Cecil, & Southern Railroad opened a 4+1⁄2-mile spur from Childs to Providence, this road bringing freight rail service to a cluster of manufacturers on the Little Elk Creek.  In May 1972, the B & O, which had acquired the line many years earlier, gave notice that it was completely abandoning the branch, which had seen declining service for decades as industries along the creek closed.The Childs Post Office was established in 1887, and has been housed in at least three locations since that time. The ZIP code is 21916. The Post Office is currently located on Blue Ball Road, just north of the intersection of Childs and Blue Ball Road. At one time it was housed in the Old Childs Store, located at the northwest corner of what is now Childs, Star Route and Blue Ball Roads. The Old Childs Store is now an antique and art store. The third location was in a small one room building. In 1985, Childs was the location for the first issue of a six-cent tricycle stamp. A forgery of the first day of issue bearing a Childs postmark can be found on display at the Smithsonian.The Cecil County Poorhouse was located just outside of Childs when the county purchased about 174 acres of land adjacent to the village from Henry Hollingsworth in 1788.   Paupers, the elderly, sick, and mentally ill, people with nowhere else to turn, were cared for here until 1952.  That year, the old county farm property was put up for sale.  It was purchased by Elk Paper Manufacturing Company of Childs, the new owner donating part of the tract to the Oblate Sisters of Mt. Aviat Academy.The potter's field, the final resting place for paupers who couldn't afford a burial, is located across the road from Mt. Aviat Academy.  It was used as the county cemetery until 1950, and there are from this period some 150 to 200 unmarked graves.  There is a stone on the southern side of Childs Road that notes the location and dates of active use of the burial ground. The Potter's Field was also the site of a public execution in 1879.


== Culture ==
The Oblates of St. Francis de Sales have a facility in Childs which includes the Shrine of our Lady of the Highways, visible from Interstate 95. Early one foggy morning in October 1968 as seminarians, priests, and brothers were starting their early morning routine, they heard crash and crash on I-95. A swath of almost impenetrable fog had settled in this stretch of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway where it crosses the Little Elk Creek at Childs. As cars hit the dense fog, drivers slammed on the brakes, triggering a chain reaction as 20 vehicles quickly piled up. The first urgent call for emergency services came in at 6:20 a..m. from the Oblates. While they waited for fire and rescue services, seminarians and priests comforted the injured and dying. Three people died that morning before the sun came up. The young novitiates and seminarians were so moved by their experience as they waited for rescue units to make their way through the dense autumn fog that they erected a shrine in 1973, dedicating it to the memory of three people who died in the accident.American songwriter Zoe Mulford released a 2006 CD, ""Roadside Saints,"" which contains a track about the ""stone lady,"" the shrine that encourages prayers for the safety of travelers.


== Geography ==
The Little Elk Creek winds through Childs, parallel to Maryland Route 545 (Blue Ball Road).


== Notable people ==
Richard C. Brookings and Mary Carter, the parents of Robert Brookings, founder of the Brookings Institution, were from the Childs area.
Confederate general William W. Mackall grew up in Childs at the Wilna, a home said to date to 1740. Richard Mackall, William W. Mackall's brother, was born at the Wilna and was a dentist and member of the Maryland General Assembly.

"Sir Archibald Macdonald, 3rd Baronet","Sir Archibald Keppel Macdonald, 3rd Baronet (15 October 1820 – 28 March 1901) was an English first-class cricketer and British Army officer.
The son of Sir James Macdonald and Lady Sophia Keppel, he was born at London in October 1820. He was educated at Harrow School. His father died in June 1832, with Macdonald succeeding him as the 3rd Baronet at the age of 12.
Macdonald joined the British Army in November 1839, when he purchased the ranks of ensign and lieutenant in the Royal Scots Fusiliers. Macdonald played a single first-class cricket match for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against Cambridge University at Fenner's in 1841. Batting once in the MCC first innings, he was dismissed without scoring by William de St Croix; he was absent hurt in their second innings. He later purchased the ranks of lieutenant and captain in November 1845. Macdonald retired from active service in March 1849.He was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Hampshire in April 1853, and later served as High Sheriff of Hampshire in February 1865. Other duties during his life included being Page of Honour to William IV and equerry to the Duke of Sussex, in addition to being a justice of the peace for both Hampshire and Surrey. Macdonald was twice married, firstly to Lady Margaret Sophia Coke, daughter of the 1st Earl of Leicester. He had no issue with Lady Margaret, but did have an illegitimate son, Archibald Godfrey MacDonald, with Charlotte Chamberlain in 1849. His second wife was Catherine Mary Coulthurst, whom he married in 1869 and had two children; a son and a daughter. Macdonald died in March 1901 at Liphook, at which point he was succeeded as the 4th Baronet by his legitimate son Sir Archibald John Macdonald.

TraJ 5' UTR,"The traJ 5' UTR is a cis acting RNA element which is involved in regulating plasmid transfer in bacteria.
In conjugating bacteria the FinOP system regulates the transfer of F-like plasmids. The FinP gene encodes an antisense RNA product that is complementary to part of the 5' UTR of the traJ mRNA. The traJ gene encodes a protein required for transcription from the major transfer promoter, pY. The FinO protein is essential for effective repression, acting by binding to FinP and protecting it from RNase E degradation.

Café du Tambourin,"Café du Tambourin was a restaurant in Paris, France.  Owned by Agostina Segatori, it was first located at 27 rue de Richelieu, and then in March 1885 reopened at 62 Boulevard de Clichy. Famous painter, Jules Chéret, made a poster for the Cabaret at the reopening. The Café had an original decor in which Segatori hung works given to her by  Edourd Dantan.
The cafe was frequented by the friends of Dantan and Van Gogh. In 1887, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec possibly created his 1887 portrait of Van Gogh at the Café du Tambourin. The café was also frequently visited by writers and art critics such as author Sophie de Juvigny. The Café Tambourin was the location of Van Gogh's first exhibition in Paris, probably only still lifes of flowers. In March 1887 Segatori and Van Gogh presented a collection of Japanese prints acquired by the artist. In July 1887, Van Gogh exhibited his works and those of his friends, Paul Gauguin, Louis Anquetin and Émile Bernard. At this exhibition, Émile Bernard and Louis Anquetin sold their work for the first time.
Later, the Café du Tambourin became bankrupt, and was renamed the Cabaret de la Butte in 1893 and then the Cabaret des Quat'z'Arts at the end of the century.

Acadian French,"Acadian French (French: français acadien, acadjonne) is a variety of French spoken by Acadians, mostly in the region of Acadia, Canada. Acadian French has 7 regional accents, including Chiac and Brayon.


== Phonology ==
Since there was relatively little linguistic contact with France from the late 18th century to the 20th century, Acadian French retained features that died out during the French standardization efforts of the 19th century such as these:

The /ʁ/ phoneme, Acadian French has retained an alveolar trill or an alveolar flap, but modern speakers pronounce it as in Parisian French: rouge (red) can be pronounced [ruːʒ], [ɾuːʒ] or [ʁuːʒ].
In nonstandard Acadian French, the third-person plural ending of verbs ‹-ont›, such as ils mangeont [i(l) mɑ̃ˈʒɔ̃] (they eat), is still pronounced, unlike standard French (France and Quebec) ils mangent ([i(l) ˈmɒ̃ːʒ(ə)] (France)/[i ˈmãːʒ(ə)] or (Quebec)/[ɪl ˈmãːʒ(ə)] ), the ‹e› can be pronounced or not, but ‹-nt› is always silent.According to Wiesmath (2006), some characteristics of Acadian are:

The verbal ending -ont in the third person plural
Palatalization of /k/ and /ɡ/ to [tʃ] and [dʒ], respectively
A featured called l'ouisme where bonne is pronounced [bʊn]These features typically occur in the speech of older people.
Many aspects of Acadian French (vocabulary and ""trill r"", etc.) are still common in rural areas in the South West of France. Speakers of Metropolitan French and even of other Canadian varieties of French sometimes have difficulty understanding Acadian French. Within North America, its closest relative is the Cajun French spoken in Southern Louisiana since both were born out of the same population that were affected during the Expulsion of the Acadians.
See also Chiac, a variety with strong English influence, and St. Marys Bay French, a distinct variety of Acadian French spoken around Clare, Tusket, Nova Scotia and also Moncton, New Brunswick.


=== Palatalization ===
not to be confused with affrication typical of Quebec French.

/k/ and /tj/ are commonly replaced by [tʃ] before a front vowel. For example, quel, queue, cuillère and quelqu'un are usually pronounced tchel, tcheue, tchuillère and tchelqu'un. Tiens is pronounced tchin [t͡ʃɛ̃].
/ɡ/ and /dj/ often become [d͡ʒ] (sometimes [ʒ]) before a front vowel. For example, bon dieu and gueule become [bɔ̃ ˈdʒø] and [d͡ʒœl] in informal Acadian French. Braguette becomes [bɾaˈd͡ʒɛt]. (This pronunciation led to the word Cajun, from Acadien.)


=== Metathesis ===
Metathesis is quite common. For example, mercredi ('Wednesday') is mercordi, and pauvreté ('poverty') is pauveurté. Je (the pronoun 'I') is frequently pronounced euj and Le is frequently pronounced eul.
In words, ""re"" is often pronounced ""er"". For instance :

erçu for ""reçu"", ertourner for ""retourner"", erpas for ""repas"", ergret for ""regret"", s'entertenir for ""s'entretenir"".


=== Vowels ===
Acadian French has maintained phonemic distinctions between /a/ and /ɑ/, /ɛ/ and /ɛː/, /ø/ and /ə/, /ɛ̃/ and /œ̃/.
In informal speech, the /ɑ/ vowel is realized as [ɔ]: pas ('step') /pɑ/ → [pɔ] and bras (arm) /bʁɑ/ → [bʁɔ], etc.
The short /ɛ/ is realized as [ɛ] and it is the same as Parisian French.
/ɛː/ is open to [æː] or closed to [eː], it depends on the region: fête ('party') /fɛːt/ → [fæːt] or [feːt] and caisse ('case') /kɛːs/ → [kæːs] or [keːs], etc.
The ⟨oi⟩ spelling has different pronunciations. Old speakers pronounce it [wɛ], because the traditional Parisian pronunciation was like this: roi ('king') [rwɛ]. But in modern standard Acadian French, it is pronounced [wa]. Even where there is no circumflex, there are some words which are phonemically pronounced /wɑ/ and the phoneme is pronounced as [wɑ] in formal speech but [wɔ] in informal speech: trois ('three') [tʁ̥wɑ] or [tʁ̥wɔ] and noix ('nut') [nwɑ] or [nwɔ]. The ⟨oî⟩ spelling is phonemically /wɑ/, but old speakers pronounce it [weː], while modern speakers pronounce it [wɑː] as in Quebec French: boîte ('box') [bweːt] or [bwɑːt] and croître ('grow') [kɾweːt(ɾ)] or [kʁ̥wɑːt(ʁ̥)], etc.


=== Elision of final consonants ===
Consonant clusters finishing a word are reduced, often losing altogether the last or two last consonants in informal speech: table ('table') /tabl/ → [tab] and livre ('book'/'pound') /livʁ/ → [liːv], etc.


== Vocabulary and grammar ==
Yves Cormier's Dictionnaire du français acadien (ComiersAcad) includes the majority of Acadian regionalisms. From a syntactic point of view, a major feature is the use of je for the first-person singular and plural; the same phenomenon takes place with i for the third persons. Acadian still differentiates the vous form from the tu form.
The following words and expressions are most commonly restricted to Acadian French south of the Miramichi River, but some are also used north of the Miramichi River and in Quebec French (also known as Québécois) or Joual for the Montreal version of Quebec French. The Miramichi line is an isogloss separating South Acadian (archaic or ""true"" Acadian) from the Canadian French dialects to the north, North Acadian, Brayon (Madawaskan) and Quebec French (Laurentian French). South Acadian typically has morphosyntactic features such as [je [V [-on] … ]] (as in je parlons ""we speak"") that distinguishes it from dialects to the north or elsewhere in the Americas such as Cajun French, Saint-Barthélemy French or Métis French that have [nouzot [on- [V …]]] (as in nous-autres on parle).

2014 Roscommon County Council election,"An election to Roscommon County Council took place on 23 May 2014 as part of that year's Irish local elections. 18 councillors were elected from three electoral divisions by PR-STV voting for a five-year term of office, a reduction in 8 seats from the previous election in 2009. Boyle Town Council was also abolished.
Fine Gael imploded in the county, losing 7 seats including those of a number of long serving councillors; due to voter anger over continuous boil water notices and the closure of Roscommon Hospital's Accident and Emergency Department; the latter leading to a split in the party locally. Fianna Fáil and Independents performed well in the election with the former becoming the largest party in Roscommon for the first time since 1985.

Jules Delsart,"Jules Delsart (24 November 1844 – 3 July 1900) was a French cellist and teacher. He is best known for his arrangement for cello and piano of César Franck's Violin Sonata in A major. Musicologist Lynda MacGregor described Delsart as ""one of the foremost French cellists of the period, with faultless technique, a precise bow and a sweet, though not large, tone."" He was the owner of the 1689 'Archinto' Stradivari.


== Life and career ==
Born in Valenciennes in 1844, Delsart began his studies at the Académie de Musique in his native city before transferring to the Conservatoire de Paris, where he earned a First Prize in cello performance in 1866. His principal teacher was Auguste Franchomme, whom he succeeded as professor of cello at the Conservatoire upon Franchomme's death in 1884. He remained in that position for the rest of his life. His students included Paul Bazelaire, Horace Britt, Marcel Casadesus, Louis Feuillard, Louis Fournier, Víctor Mirecki Larramat, Henri Mulet, and Georges Papin.Following his graduation from the Paris Conservatoire, Delsart embarked on several successful tours throughout Europe. On 26 February 1881 he premiered in the Salle Pleyel the cello sonata of Marie Jaëll, with the composer playing the piano. In 1882 she dedicated her cello concerto to him. He made numerous appearances in London, including performing in the world premiere of David Popper's Requiem for three cellos and orchestra alongside the composer and Edward Howell as his fellow cellists at St James's Hall on 25 November 1891. In 1892, at La Trompette, accompanied by Louis Breitner, he premiered Chant saphique, Op. 91, a piece for cello and piano by Camille Saint-Saëns, which was dedicated to him. Other works dedicated to Delsart included David Popper's Nocturne, Léon Boëllmann's Cello Sonata, and Benjamin Godard's On the Lake.
Delsart was also active as a chamber musician. From 1875, along with the founder Martin Pierre Marsick, Louis van Waefelghem and Guillaume Rémy, he was the cellist of the Quatuor Marsick, one of the best and most famous string quartets in Paris of the time. With André Messager and Guillaume Rémy, he played in a piano trio which premiered Ernest Chausson's Trio in G minor, Op. 3, in 1882. He also played in a trio led by Pablo de Sarasate.In addition to the cello, Delsart occasionally performed on the viola da gamba, which he began studying in 1887. His interest in this instrument led him to found the Société des Instruments Anciens (SIA) with Louis Diémer (harpsichord), van Waefelghem (viola d'amore) and Grillet (vielle) in 1889. The SIA performed successfully throughout Europe for a decade, although Delsart was only a member during its early years. He was succeeded in the Société by two of his pupils, Papin and Casadesus.Delsart died in Paris in 1900, aged 55, and was buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery. During his lifetime, his portrait was painted by Jean-André Rixens and Julien Decle; both paintings are in the Musée des Beaux Arts, Valenciennes. There is a Rue Jules Delsart in Valenciennes.


== Arrangements ==

Delsart's arrangement for cello and piano of César Franck's Violin Sonata in A major was sanctioned by the composer, and has become a standard part of the cello repertoire. After thorough historical study based on reliable documents, Delsart's transcription for cello (the piano part remains the same as in the violin sonata) was published by G. Henle Verlag  as Urtext edition. He also arranged for cello and piano the Méditation from Massenet's Thaïs (normally played by violin and orchestra); and Fauré's Three Romances sans paroles, Op. 17, for piano.

With his luck turning, he closes a contract for Platt, his old employer, with a commission of $5,000. Douglas, who let the canning factory go to pieces, is willing to sell out for that amount. Simp buys the place and is immediately approached by Platt, who has received word that his factory has burned down. Since he cannot fulfill the contract, Platt demands return of the $5,000. But Simp takes over the contract, borrows some money from the town banker, and is well on the way to his fortune. As his boyhood sweetheart Tiny now weights two hundred pounds, his youthful illusion has faded and he begins to look to Hope with the eyes of love.

Widowed when Sir Alexander died in a bridge collapse, Alice returned to England, marrying Sir George in 1871. Winthrop's brother Edward Hilton Young became the 1st Baron Kennet. His son Jocelin Winthrop Young was a Royal Navy officer and educator who founded the Round Square association of schools and was private tutor to Constantine II of Greece.


== Mountaineering ==
Educated at Marlborough, Young began rock climbing shortly before his first term at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied Classics and won the Chancellor's Medal for English Verse two years running. While there, Young wrote a humorous college climbing guide called The Roof-Climber's Guide to Trinity, in part a parody of early alpine guidebooks, in part a useful reference work for those, like him, who were keen to clamber up Cambridge's highest spires.During the Edwardian Period, and up until the outbreak of hostilities heralding World War I, Young made several new and difficult ascents in the Alps, including noted routes on the Zermatt Breithorn on Monte Rosa (the ""Younggrat""), the west ridge of the Gspaltenhorn, on the west face of the Weisshorn, and a dangerous and rarely repeated route on the south face of the Täschhorn. His finest rock climb was the Mer de Glace face of the Aiguille du Grépon. In 1911, with H. O. Jones, he ascended the Brouillard ridge of Mont Blanc and made the first complete traverse of the west ridge of the Grandes Jorasses, and the first descent of the ridge to the Col des Hirondelles. His favoured, but not only, guide was Josef Knubel of St Niklaus.
Winthrop Young also put up new routes on the crags of Northumberland the Lake District and Wales. He was elected president of the Climbers' Club in 1913, and he organised the Pen-y-Pass gatherings that propelled the advancement of rock climbing and included such technical luminaries as J. M. Archer Thompson, George Leigh Mallory, Siegfried Herford, John Percy Farrar and Oscar Eckenstein. These parties, beginning in earnest about 1907, and sometimes reaching sixty men, women and children, flooded the hotel and overflowed into Eckenstein's miner's cabin and various tents. They came to an end in 1914.


== World War I and injury ==
During the war, Young was at first a correspondent for the liberal Daily News, but later, as a conscientious objector, was active in the FAU, the Friends' Ambulance Unit. Sent to Italy he drove ambulances sometimes in the thick of battle, and as such he received several decorations. On 31 August 1917 on the Isonzo Front during the fight for Monte San Gabriele, an explosion caused injuries requiring the amputation of one of his legs. After the amputation, Young walked sixteen miles in two days to avoid being captured by the Austrians. He continued alpine climbing for a number of years – using a specially designed artificial leg that accepted a number of attachments for snow and rock work – and climbed the Matterhorn in 1928.
At the conclusion of the war in 1918 he married Eleanor Winthrop Young (née Slingsby), who helped him return to climbing after his amputation and often accompanied him on expeditions. The biography written by Alan Hankinson mentions Winthrop Young's bisexuality.


== Outdoor educator and administrator ==
In 1920 Young published the 300-page manual of mountaineering instruction entitled Mountain Craft, to which Eckenstein and J. Norman Collie also contributed. The editor of the Alpine Club, John Percy Farrar, wrote to Young on the book's publication, saying: 'The book is magnificent ... It will be standard for so long as mankind is interested in mountaineering. The profound amount of work put into it staggers me.'To support himself and his family he worked for the Rockefeller Foundation, and spent much time in Germany, and – having met Kurt Hahn before the War – helped Hahn immigrate to England in 1934. Much of what may be called an outdoor adventure education springs from this connection. The now famous Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme and the International Award scheme comes from this co-operation between Hahn and Young. The Outward Bound movement, after World War II, owes a considerable debt to their friendship.During World War II, Young was president of the Alpine Club and it was through his efforts that the British Mountaineering Council, the umbrella organisation for climbers in Great Britain, was created in 1945.

Gaganyaan,"Gaganyaan (from Sanskrit: gagana, ""celestial"" and yāna, ""craft, vehicle"") is an Indian crewed orbital spacecraft intended to be the formative spacecraft of the Indian Human Spaceflight Programme. The spacecraft is being designed to carry three people, and a planned upgraded version will be equipped with rendezvous and docking capabilities. In its maiden crewed mission, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)'s largely autonomous 5.3-metric ton capsule will orbit the Earth at 400 km altitude for up to seven days with a two- or three-person crew on board. The first crewed mission was originally planned to be launched on ISRO's LVM3 rocket in December 2021. As of October 2023, it is expected to be launched by 2024.The Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL)-manufactured crew module underwent its first uncrewed experimental flight on 18 December 2014. As of May 2019, design of the crew module has been completed. Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) will provide support for critical human-centric systems and technologies such as space-grade food, crew healthcare, radiation measurement and protection, parachutes for the safe recovery of the crew module, and the fire suppression system.On 11 June 2020, it was announced that the first uncrewed Gaganyaan launch would be delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in India. The overall timeline for crewed launches was expected to remain unaffected. ISRO chairman S. Somanath announced on 30 June 2022, that the first crewed mission will not take place until 2024 at the earliest because of safety concerns. Further sources in 2023 confirmed that ISRO has been aiming for a 2024 launch.


== Background ==
In 1984, Rakesh Sharma became the first Indian born citizen to enter space through a joint Interkosmos mission between ISRO and Soviet space program, when he flew aboard the Soviet rocket Soyuz T-11 launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic on 3 April 1984. The Soyuz T-11 spacecraft carrying cosmonauts including Sharma docked and transferred the three member Soviet-Indian international crew, consisting of the ship's commander, Yury Malyshev, and flight engineer, Gennadi Strekalov, to the Salyut 7 Orbital Station. Sharma spent 7 days, 21 hours, and 40 minutes aboard the Salyut 7.


== Gaganyaan Program history ==
Preliminary studies and technological development of Gaganyaan started in 2006 under the generic name ""Orbital Vehicle"". The plan was to design a simple capsule with an endurance of about a week in space, a capacity of two astronauts, and a splashdown landing after re-entry. The project was commissioned in 2007, with expected completion by 2024 and a budget of around ₹10,000 crore. The design was finalized by March 2008 and submitted to the Government of India for funding. The government's funding for the Indian Human Spaceflight Program was sanctioned in February 2009, But it fell short due to limited developmental funding. Initially, the first uncrewed flight of the orbital vehicle was proposed to be in 2013, then it was revised to 2016. However, in April 2012, it was reported that funding problems placed the future of the project in serious doubt. And in August 2013, it was announced that all crewed spaceflight efforts by India had been designated as being ""off ISRO's priority list"". By early 2014, the project had been reconsidered and was one of the main beneficiaries of a substantial budget increase announced in February 2014. ISRO is developing the Gaganyaan orbital vehicle based on the tests performed with their scaled 550 kg Space Capsule Recovery Experiment (SRE), which was launched and recovered in January 2007.The latest push for the Indian Human Spaceflight Program took place in 2017, And it was accepted and formally announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his 2018 Independence Day address to the nation. The current design calls for a crew of three. ISRO will perform four biological and two physical science experiments related to microgravity during the Gaganyaan mission. ISRO is planning to replace hydrazine with green propellant on Gaganyaan missions, for which Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC) is already working on a monopropellant blended formulation consisting of hydroxylammonium nitrate (HAN), ammonium nitrate, methanol and water.As of October 2021, ISRO selected five science experiments that will be conducted on Gaganyaan. The payloads will be developed by the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST), University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad (UASD), Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), IIT Patna, Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT) and the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR). Out of the five, two are biological experiments that will be conducted by IIST, UASD and TIFR and will include kidney stone formation and Sirtuin 1 gene marker effects in Drosophila melanogaster. IIT Patna will run experiments on a heat sink that can handle very high heat flux, IICT will study crystallization phenomena, and JNCASR will examine fluid mixing characteristics.


=== Funding and infrastructure ===
A crewed spacecraft would require about ₹12,400 crore (US$1.77 billion) over a period of seven years, including the ₹5,000 crore (US$0.7 billion) for the initial work of the crewed spacecraft during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2007–2012) out of which the Government released ₹ 50 crore (US$7 million) in 2007–2008. In December 2018, the government approved a further ₹10,000 crore (US$1.5 billion) for a 7-day crewed flight of 3 astronauts to take place by 2021.Madhavan Chandradathan, director of Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC), stated that ISRO would need to set up an astronaut training facility in Bangalore. The newly established Human Space Flight Centre (HSFC) will coordinate the IHSF efforts. Existing launch facilities will be upgraded for launches under the Indian Human Spaceflight project. With extra facilities needed for launch escape systems. Russia is likely to provide astronaut training. In Spring 2009, the full-scale mock-up of the crew capsule of Gaganyaan was built and delivered to Satish Dhawan Space Center for the training of astronauts.India has already successfully developed and tested several building blocks, including re-entry space capsule, pad abort test, safe crew ejection mechanism in case of rocket failure, a flight suit developed by Defence Bioengineering and Electromedical Laboratory (DEBEL) and the powerful GSLV-MkIII launch vehicle. Having met all required technological keystones, the Indian Human Spaceflight Programme was accepted and formally announced by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 15 August 2018. Gaganyaan will be the first crewed spacecraft under this programme.ISRO's Human Space Flight Centre and Glavcosmos, which is a subsidiary of the Russian state corporation Roscosmos, signed an agreement on 1 July 2019 for cooperation in the selection, support, medical examination and space training of Indian astronauts. An ISRO Technical Liaison Unit (ITLU) has been approved to be set up in Moscow for coordination.
Glavkosmos has also contracted NPP Zvezda for manufacturing customized IVA flight-suits for Indian astronauts. ISRO is planning to develop a ground station for Gaganyaan mission at Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and after a brief discussion with Australian Space Agency, a temporary ground station for the mission has been set up by ISRO in Cocos (Keeling) Islands, as of 2021.


== Description ==


=== Crew module ===
Gaganyaan crew module is a fully autonomous 5.3 t (12,000 lb) spacecraft designed to carry a 3-member crew to orbit and safely return to the Earth after a mission duration of up to seven days. 
The crew module is equipped with two parachutes for redundancy, with one parachute enough for a safe splashdown. The parachutes would reduce the speed of the crew module from over 216 m/s (710 ft/s) to under 11 m/s (36 ft/s) at splashdown.The space capsule will have life support and environmental control systems. It will be equipped with emergency mission abort capabilities and a Crew Escape System (CES) that can be activated during the first stage or second rocket stage burn. The nose of the original version of the orbital vehicle was free for a docking mechanism, but primary entry was evidently through a side hatch secured by explosive bolts. On 7 December 2022, The Hindu reported that the crew module had entered the production stage.


=== Service module ===
Its 2.9 t (6,400 lb) service module is powered by liquid propellant engines. The crew module is mated to the service module, and together they constitute 8.2 t (18,000 lb) orbital module.The Service Module Propulsion System (SMPS) will perform an orbit raising manoeuvre allowing Gaganyaan to reach 400 km in low Earth orbit (LEO), then remain docked during a deorbit burn until atmospheric reentry. It will use an unified bipropellant system consisting of MON-3 and Monomethylhydrazine as oxidizer and fuel, having five main engines derived from ISRO's liquid apogee motor with 440 N (99 lbf) thrust and sixteen 100 N reaction control system (RCS) thrusters.


== Development ==
Following three uncrewed orbital flight demonstrations of the spacecraft, a crewed Gaganyaan is slated to be launched on the HLVM3 (Human-rated version of LVM3) launcher no earlier than 2024. Though the spacecraft is designed to carry 3 people, it is likely that the first flight will carry one person only.


=== Test flights ===


=== Test flight profile ===
About 16 minutes after liftoff from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC), Sriharikota, the rocket will inject the spacecraft into an orbit 300–400 km (190–250 mi) above Earth. When ready to land, its service module and solar panels will be disposed of before reentry. The capsule would return for a parachute splashdown in the Bay of Bengal.


== Testing ==


=== Crew Module Atmospheric Re-entry Experiment ===
On 13 February 2014, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited handed over the first boilerplate prototype of Crew Module structural assembly to ISRO for Crew Module Atmospheric Re-entry Experiment (CARE). ISRO's Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre would equip the Crew Module with systems necessary for life support, navigation, guidance and control systems.ISRO undertook an uncrewed test launch of the vehicle aboard the LVM3-X, for an experimental sub-orbital flight on 18 December 2014. The crew module separated from the rocket at an altitude of 126 km. On-board motors controlled and reduced the speed of the module until an altitude of 80 km (50 mi). Thrusters were shut off at that altitude and atmospheric drag further reduced speed of the capsule.
The module's heat shield was expected to experience temperature in excess of 1,600 °C (2,910 °F). Parachutes were deployed at an altitude of 15 km (9.3 mi) to slow down the module, which performed a splashdown in the Bay of Bengal near Andaman and Nicobar Islands.This flight was used to test orbital injection, separation and re-entry procedures and systems of the Crew Capsule. Also tested were the capsule separation, heat shields and aerobraking systems, parachute deployment, retro-firing, splashdown, flotation systems, and procedures to recover the Crew Capsule from the Bay of Bengal. Inflight launch abort and parachute tests were expected to be conducted by the end of 2019.


=== Pad Abort Test ===

The Indian Space Research Organisation's Pad Abort Test was conducted successfully on 5 July 2018. As of September 2021, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) was integrating a test vehicle to conduct an uncrewed flight test of Crew Escape System (CES) before the official launch of Gaganyaan mission. The test vehicle was planned be ready by the end of 2021.


=== Vikas engine qualification ===

Vikas engine variants are used to power the second stage of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), boosters and second stage of the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) Mark I and II, and also the core stage of LVM 3.
On 14 July 2021 ISRO conducted third long duration hot test of Vikas engine for core L110 liquid stage of GSLV Mark III at ISRO Propulsion Complex as part of the engine qualification requirements of the Gaganyaan mission. The engine was successfully test fired for a duration of 240 seconds validating all the required performance parameters.On 20 January 2022, High Thrust Vikas Engine successfully underwent a hot qualification test for duration of 25 seconds at ISRO Propulsion Complex to validate engine robustness under non-nominal operating conditions for fuel-oxidiser mixture ratio and chamber pressure.


=== Static test for Low Altitude Escape Motor ===
On 11 August 2022 ISRO successfully completed the test firing of Low Altitude Escape Motor (LEM) for Crew Escape System. LEM consists of a solid rocket motor with four reverse flow nozzles that generates maximum sea level thrust of 842 kN (nominal) with burn time of 5.98 second (nominal). The nozzle end of LEM is mounted at the fore end of the launch vehicle to avoid exhaust plume impingement on crew module. This is why there are reverse flow multiple nozzle in the solid rocket motor. The reverse flow nozzle makes exhaust gas flow in opposite direction in the nozzle region.The objective of this test was to check ballistic parameters, validate motor subsystem performance (and confirm the design margins), evaluate the thermal performance of nozzle liners especially to confirm the ablative characteristics, validate integrity of all interfaces, evaluate the head-end mounted safe arm (HMSA) based ignition system performance, and evaluate side thrust due to misalignment and variation in flow and other functional parameters including flow reversal.


=== Service Module Propulsion System ===
On 28 August 2021 ISRO successfully tested a System Demonstration Model (SDM) of the Service Module Propulsion System (SMPS) that will be integrated into the Gaganyaan spacecraft. During on-ground testing at ISRO Propulsion Complex (IPRC), the SDM was fired for a duration of 450 seconds which matched the pre-test prediction data using five main engines and eight RCS thrusters. Each 440 N thrust engine will also be tested individually for longer duration involving various parameters to gain human-rating certification.


=== CE-20 engine qualification ===

On 12 January 2022, ISRO conducted a hot qualification test on CE-20 cryogenic engine for a duration of 720 seconds at ISRO Propulsion Complex (IPRC). On 28 October 2022, CE-20 E11 successfully completed a Pressure Chamber Test for 30 seconds at IPRC. It was done to check the efficacy of the engine for Gaganyaan missions. On 9 November 2022, the duration was increased to 70 seconds. The test results were on expected lines as per ISRO sources.


=== Static fire test of HS200 ===
A human-rated variant of the S200 solid strap-on booster, or 'HS200', was developed for the Gaganyaan programme. The first static fire test of HS200 was conducted on 13 May 2022 at SDSC SHAR for a duration of 135 seconds with nominal performance.


=== Integrated Main Parachute Airdrop Test ===
 On 18 November 2022, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) conducted an Integrated Main Parachute Airdrop Test (IMAT) of the Parachute Deceleration System (PDS), in which 5-ton dummy mass equivalent of the actual crew module mass was taken to an altitude of 2.5 km and dropped from Ilyushin Il-76 by Indian Air Force. Two small pyro-based mortar-deployed pilot parachutes then pulled the main parachutes free. The size of the main parachutes was initially restricted to a smaller area to reduce opening shock. After 7 seconds, the pyro-based reefing line cutters cut the area restricting line, allowing the parachutes to inflate fully. The fully inflated main parachutes reduced the payload speed to a safe landing speed. The entire sequence lasted about 2-3 minutes.The Parachute Deceleration System is jointly developed by ISRO and DRDO. System design, analytical simulations for parachute deployment, development of ordnance devices for parachute ejection, mechanical assembly, instrumentation and avionics were done by VSSC. In total, five air dropped tests (of 10 parachutes) are planned as part of qualification process.


=== Test Vehicle Abort Mission-1 ===
Test Vehicle Abort Mission-1 (TV-D1) was a high altitude abort test as part of the Gaganyaan program, held on 21 October 2023 at around 10:00 a.m IST. The rocket launch was the second attempt of the day, with the initial try halted just five seconds before the scheduled time. The primary purpose of the test was to ensure the crew's ability to safely exit the rocket in the event of a malfunction. Originally slated for 8:00 local time, the launch was postponed for 45 minutes due to weather-related concerns.During TV-D1 mission, the crew module experience an unexpected upended orientation while being recovered by Indian Navy from Bay of Bengal. In order to mitigate the problem and improve safety, ISRO is going to test an ""uprighting system"" that resembles gaseous balloons and works similarly to airbags in cars to keep the crew module from toppling over in the event of lateral wind and sea wave disturbances following splashdown. Redundancy is built into the system to guard against failure. Test Vehicle Abort Mission-2 (TV-D2) is scheduled to launch in Q1 2024 by ISRO. The crew escape mechanism will use low and high altitude escape motors, while the crew module control systems will mimic the crew seat, suspension, and uprighting systems.


== Vyommitra ==

On 22 January 2020, ISRO announced Vyommitra, a female-looking robot who will accompany the other astronauts in the mission. ISRO aims not to fly animals onboard experimental missions unlike other nations that have carried out human space flight. Instead, it will fly humanoid robots for a better understanding of what weightlessness and radiation do to the human body during long durations in space.Vyommitra is expected to be onboard uncrewed Gaganyaan missions to perform microgravity experiments, monitor module parameters, and support astronauts in crewed missions by simulating functions like a human from the waist up. It does not have legs. It is programmed to speak Hindi and English and perform multiple tasks.It can detect and give out warnings if environmental changes within the cabin get uncomfortable to astronauts and change the air condition. It can autonomously complete tasks and follow new commands.

"Hall, Texas","Hall is an unincorporated community in San Saba County, in the U.S. state of Texas. According to the Handbook of Texas, the community had a population of 15 in 2000.


== History ==
Hall was founded in 1903 when settlers purchased land from the local Hall and Selman ranches. The Hall Ranch was established by John Mabin “Pony” Hall in 1855. Settlers in the area included Frank Templeton, Bill Wicker, and a man surnamed Woolsey. A Unity Baptist Church building was erected in 1913. Mr. Templeton opened the first store in Hall in 1906. A post office was established here on September 14, 1911, by William Nathan Hudson in his general store and named it Hall in honor of the Hall family. That same year, the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway built a track and a depot here and built cattle pens the following year. Hall had 150 residents, a bank, two general stores, and churches for Christian and Baptist congregations in 1914. The population decreased to 82 in 1925, causing the post office to close in either 1942 or 1943. It went down to 50 in 1986 and farmers grew peanuts and grain crops on their ranches. The population was 15 in 2000.


== Geography ==
Hall is located along Farm to Market Road 2997, 6 mi (9.7 km) west of Richland Springs in western San Saba County.


== Education ==
Hall had its first school built in 1905. It burned to the ground in 1914 and schoolchildren finished the year at the local Woodmen's lodge. A three-room school building served the community until it joined the Richland Springs Independent School District in 1932.

Scout Moor Wind Farm,"Scout Moor Wind Farm is the second largest onshore wind farm in England. The wind farm, which was built for Peel Wind Power Ltd, produces electricity from 26 Nordex N80 wind turbines. It has a total nameplate capacity of 65 MW of electricity, providing 154,000 MW·h per year; enough to serve the average needs of 40,000 homes. The site occupies 1,347 acres (545 ha) of open moorland between Edenfield, Rawtenstall and Rochdale, and is split between the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale in northern Greater Manchester and the Borough of Rossendale in south-eastern Lancashire. The turbines are visible from as far away as south Manchester, 15–20 miles (24–32 km) away.A protest group was formed to resist the proposed construction, and attracted support from the botanist and environmental campaigner David Bellamy. Despite the opposition, planning permission was granted in 2005 and construction began in 2007. Although work on the project was hampered by harsh weather, difficult terrain, and previous mining activity, the wind farm was officially opened on 25 September 2008 after ""years of controversy"", at a cost of £50 million.
In 2012 Peel Energy sold its 50% share in the facility to Munich Re's asset management division MEAG. The other 50% holding was also purchased by MEAG from HgCapital Renewable Power Partners.


== Geography ==
Scout Moor is an upland moor of peat bog and heather in the South Pennines, reaching a maximum elevation of 1,552 feet (473 m) at its peak, Top of Leach. The underlying geology – a mixture of hard rock and soft shales – broadly belongs to the Lower Coal Measures. The rock and shales weather at different rates, giving the area a landscape of ""steep escarpments separated by sloping shelves"", although the main dome of the moor is flat and rounded. The moorland covers an area of about 1,347 acres (545 ha), of which less than 21 acres (8.5 ha), about 2%, is occupied by the wind farm.
Scout Moor Quarry, a 250-acre (100 ha) open-pit mine in Edenfield, is used for the extraction of gritstone and sandstone, and formerly had its own railway line. The eastern fringe of Scout Moor Wind Farm extends to Hail Storm Hill (also known as Cowpe Moss), one of the 180 Marilyns of England. The presence of coal under Scout Moor led to extensive and unrecorded shallow coal mining in the area during the 18th and 19th centuries. Adits, shafts and coal seams from that period mark the landscape.


== History ==
One meaning of scout is a long ridge of rock, appearing to ""shoot out"" horizontally. The word is thought to be a corruption of the Old English sceot, meaning ""shot"" or ""to shoot"", suggesting Anglo-Saxon settlement in the locality at a very ancient time.Although the UK Government has set a target of 10% for the proportion of the UK's electricity produced by renewable energy by 2010, wind power in the UK has a long history of controversy, with an average approval rate for planning permission of only 28% for onshore wind farms. Scout Moor was first identified as an excellent site for a wind farm in 2001. Peel Holdings commissioned market research consultants MORI to undertake a telephone poll over seventeen days in 2002, soliciting the opinions of residents in Bury, Rossendale and Rochdale about wind farms in general and Scout Moor in particular. The results showed that 88% of respondents thought wind farms were a very or fairly good idea, 72% thought the Scout Moor project was a very or fairly good idea, and 63% stated wind power as the preferred energy source.The proposal to build a wind farm, in a joint venture between United Utilities and Peel Holdings, was announced in 2003. Shortly afterwards a pressure group, The Friends of Scout and Knowle Moor, was formed, and on 9 September 2003 representatives of the group attended a meeting of the Metropolitan Borough of Bury's, Ramsbottom and Tottington Area Board to oppose the plans. At the meeting, the spokesperson for the group said that, although they supported the use of alternative energy, they felt that this was the wrong area. Among the objections were that the scheme was contrary to the Unitary Development Plan and the Green Belt, and would adversely affect common land, open countryside and areas of ecological importance and special landscape value. The group also considered that the proposed development would be out of scale with the landscape, adversely affecting peat, water courses and wildlife, and would have a seriously detrimental visual impact, as well as causing a noise nuisance.The second presentation was given by a representative of Scout Moor Wind Farm, who argued the need for Britain to produce clean green power without harmful emissions, to counter the increasing dangers of global warming. He went on to say that the UK has fewer wind farms than other major industrial countries in Europe, even though it is a windier country, and that North West England has a particularly poor record, with only 1.3% of electricity generated from renewable energy. Following this meeting the campaign to oppose the proposal gathered momentum, and in November 2003 a protest was held on the moor, led by environmental campaigner Professor David Bellamy.
Although Bury Metropolitan Borough Council supported the proposal, objections were raised by Lancashire County Council, Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council and Rossendale Borough Council, and a public enquiry was held in November and December 2004. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry gave formal consent to the application for the development of the wind farm in May 2005, by which time United Utilities had sold their share in the project and ended their involvement. A number of conditions were imposed:

Under section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act (1990) the applicant will be required to establish a habitat management plan. Other conditions have been
placed on the development including that:

Access tracks to all areas to and around the turbine bases shall remain unfenced. Access will be allowed on the site for the whole of the life of the development for members of the public and grazing stock.
Construction will take place outside the bird nesting season.
A survey will take place to establish the presence of badgers in the area before development takes place.
No development shall take place until there is a full archaeological investigation.
More conditions have been attached to the consent and various surveys and assessments must be carried out by the applicant before development can commence.
On 20 April 2006, Janet Anderson (Member of Parliament for Rossendale and Darwen) asked Margaret Beckett, then Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, whether the development would meet the provisions of the Commons Bill regarding the protection of and public access to common land. The reply from Jim Knight, (Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Rural Affairs, Landscape and Biodiversity) was that ""[t]hese applications are made under section 147 of the Inclosure Act 1845. Consideration is given under these provision to the effect of the exchange on the general public's legal right of access over the land. The future provisions in the Commons Bill are not relevant.""


=== Construction ===
The detailed design for the project was completed during summer 2006 and construction began in January 2007. The first task was to build a stable access road, but the moor was covered in a layer of peat with a low load-bearing capacity. The whole area had also been subjected to extensive coal mining during the 19th and early 20th centuries, so there was a potential for subsidence. To address these problems, the mining voids were grouted and a floating road was constructed, using a complex system of geotextiles and geogrids to prevent the road from sinking. This was achieved by laying a crushed-gravel base, reinforced with polyester and polypropylene grids, to bridge any potential mine voids and ensure that the weak shear strength of the subsoil was exceeded by the base course material.
The wind turbines arrived at Scout Moor in parts, transported by large goods vehicles along the M66 motorway to Edenfield as part of a 76-day-long convoy of delivery.The weather constrained the wind farm's construction for the teams from contractor McNicholas and German turbine supplier Nordex. During the final stages, the project manager for McNicholas was quoted as saying:

The weather has undoubtedly been the single biggest challenge we have faced up here. We have worked with wind speeds well in excess of 120mph and temperatures as low as minus 12 degrees Celsius, which is more like minus 25 with the wind-chill factor. I've worked on a lot of wind farm construction projects but the adverse conditions have made this one of the most difficult ... We have spent £30,000 on personal protective equipment for the workers. Keeping them warm, fed and moving in these conditions is a massive man management project, but we did it.
The wind farm, which stretches across nearly 2 miles (3.2 km) of open moorland between Edenfield, Rawtenstall and Rochdale, was officially opened on 25 September 2008. and was at that time the largest onshore wind farm in England. As of 26 August 2008, 21 of 26 turbines had been commissioned and 4,000 MW·h of electricity had been exported to the National Grid. The turbines are visible from south Manchester, 15–20 miles (24–32 km) away, and are expected to produce enough electricity to meet the needs of 40,000 average homes. Scout Moor has the capacity to produce a total of 65 MW, compared with the 90 MW capacity of Kentish Flats, the United Kingdom's largest offshore wind farm. The total cost of the Scout Moor project was £50 million, but Peel Holdings expect the turbines to be in operation for at least 25 years. Since its opening, the wind farm ""has become a real tourist attraction""; a calendar showing photographs of the wind farm's construction has been featured in local news stories.


== Future plans ==
Over the lifetime of the wind farm, Peel Holdings' energy subsidiary, Peel Wind Power Ltd, will provide up to £500,000 to help landowners create biodiverse areas on the land surrounding the moor. A prime target habitat envisaged to be enhanced and re-created under the Habitat Enhancement Plan is upland blanket bog and important habitats for skylarks and wading birds on the moorland fringe. To receive funding, landowners within an identified area will need to apply to a panel made up of representatives from Peel, the local authorities and independent ecological experts. This panel will meet regularly throughout the year.Peel Wind Power are members of RenewableUK and state in their member's profile that they are actively seeking new opportunities in the renewable energy sector. In November 2008, the company announced a two-year agreement to look at developing wind farms on land owned by UK Coal. If the 14 sites encompassed by the agreement were successfully developed, they would have the potential for 54 wind turbines generating up to 133 megawatts of power. Peel Energy director Steven Underwood said: ""This agreement is an important step for Peel Energy, significantly expanding its onshore pipeline and gaining access to some of the UK's best potential wind farm locations."" The Peel group holds a 28% stake in UK Coal.At a private meeting held in May 2007 between developers, EnergieKontor UK, and invited local councillors, plans were put forward for another large wind farm consisting of 24 turbines on the moors above nearby Haslingden, spanning Thirteen Stone Hill and Oswaldtwistle Moor. Following the meeting Catherine Pilling, a Rossendale Liberal Democrat councillor, expressed her view that the natural beauty of the Rossendale Valley was under threat as it was increasingly being targeted by wind farm developers. ""Our party is very much in favour of renewable energy,"" she said, ""but Rossendale is an area of outstanding beauty, and you have to ask: Would they be building a similar thing in the Lake District?"" Rossendale Borough Council leader Duncan Ruddick representing the electoral ward of Worsley in Rossendale, the proposed site of the new wind farm, said he was against wind farms and would be campaigning against it and speaking at the Development Control committee when it came. The leader of the Labour local councillors was also opposed to the plan, saying that he was concerned about the size of the turbines and that the visual impact on the ""beautiful West Pennine Moors"" would be devastating. Planning permission for the development was granted by Hyndburn Council in March 2010.In August 2015 planning permission was granted by Rossendale Borough Council's development control committee to add a further 14 turbines at Scout Moor to create what is believed would be England's largest onshore wind farm, but the plans drew many objections from residents and two petitions were launched by local MPs opposing the scheme. In 2017 The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Sajid Javid MP overruled Rossendale council's decision but said he was ""minded to approve"" two additional turbines in Rochdale with a maximum height of 115 metres, subject to conditions, which would potentially enlarge Scout Moor to 28 turbines.


== Specifications ==


=== Capacity factor ===

As the figures given in the table above were published before the turbines had been operational for a full year they are projected rather than recorded figures. Wind speed is not constant, therefore a wind farm's annual energy production never achieves the sum of the generator nameplate ratings multiplied by the total hours in a year. The ratio of actual productivity in a year to this theoretical maximum is called the capacity factor. Typical capacity factors are 20–40%, with values at the upper end of the range achieved on particularly favourable sites. The expected capacity factor for Scout Moor Wind Farm, calculated from the company's projected figures, is 27%. The actual capacity factor calculated from data published by OFGEM for January 2012 to December 2014 (three years of data) was 29.08%.

Repo! The Genetic Opera,"Repo! The Genetic Opera is a 2008 American gothic rock opera directed by Darren Lynn Bousman. Based on the 2002 opera of the same name, written and composed by Darren Smith and Terrance Zdunich, the film stars Alexa Vega, Paul Sorvino, Anthony Stewart Head, Sarah Brightman, Paris Hilton, Bill Moseley, Nivek Ogre and Zdunich.
Repo! premiered at the Fantasia Film Festival in July 2008, followed by a limited release on November 7, 2008, on seven screens in Pasadena, Chicago, Mobile, Charlotte, Kansas City, Toronto and Ottawa.


== Plot ==
By the year 2056, an epidemic of organ failures has devastated the planet and wiped out 99% of the human population. The megacorporation GeneCo provides organs on a payment plan. Clients who miss payments are hunted down by Repo Men, skilled assassins who ""repossess"" the organs (""Genetic Repo Man""). The CEO of GeneCo, Rotti Largo, discovers he is terminally ill. Rotti's children Luigi, Pavi, and Amber bicker over who will inherit GeneCo (""Mark It Up""), but Rotti believes none of them are worthy heirs and instead plans to give his fortune to 17-year-old Shilo Wallace, the daughter of his late ex-fiancée Marni (""Things You See In A Graveyard"").
Shilo has inherited a rare blood disease from Marni that requires her to stay indoors, though she longs to see the outside world (""Infected""). Shilo's overprotective father Nathan believes he accidentally killed Marni with a treatment he created for her illness – in truth, a jealous Rotti secretly poisoned Marni's medicine and blackmailed Nathan, promising not to arrest him if he agreed to become GeneCo's head Repo Man, though he has convinced Shilo he is a doctor (""Legal Assassin""). One night, Shilo secretly visits Marni's tomb and runs into the omniscient GraveRobber, who is digging up bodies to secrete Zydrate, a euphoric and addictive pain-killer that he sells on the street to keep up with his GeneCo payments (""21st Century Cure"").
Rotti lures Shilo to GeneCo's fair with the promise of a cure for her disease. There, she meets Blind Mag, an opera singer and GeneCo's celebrity spokesperson. Born blind, Mag has been given surgically enhanced eyes by GeneCo at the cost of indefinite employment, though she is soon resigning. GraveRobber helps Shilo escape the fairgrounds, encountering several of his customers including the surgery-addicted Amber (""Zydrate Anatomy""). Shilo learns that Mag's eyes are set for repossession and that Amber will replace her as GeneCo's spokeswoman. After GeneCops arrive, Shilo quickly returns to her room before Nathan notices her missing.
Rotti hires Nathan to repossess Mag's eyes, but Nathan refuses, citing that Mag was Marni's best friend (""Night Surgeon""). An infuriated Rotti vows to have Nathan taken out. Mag visits Shilo and reveals she is her godmother, and that Nathan had told her Shilo died with Marni. She cautions Shilo to not make the same mistakes she did (""Chase the Morning""). Nathan arrives and forces Mag out after she scolds him for lying and incarcerating Shilo (""Everyone's a Composer""). Meanwhile, Rotti writes his will, ready to make Shilo his sole beneficiary (""Gold"").
Rotti invites Shilo to the Opera (""At the Opera Tonight""). Nathan heads to the opera to find her, pursued by GeneCops, whom he quickly dispatches. Amber makes her stage debut, but her performance is ruined when her transplanted face falls off. Mag completes her final performance, but deviates from the song's grand finale, denouncing the Largo family and gouging out her eyes in an act of defiance (""Chromaggia""). Rotti cuts the cords suspending Mag, impaling her on a fence, but assures the panicking audience that Mag's death was staged as part of the show.
Shilo is approached by a Repo Man  and attacks him with a shovel, revealing that he is Nathan. She angrily confronts Nathan for lying to her about his profession (""Let the Monster Rise""). Onstage, Rotti reveals that Nathan has been poisoning Shilo's ""medicine"" in an attempt to keep her safe from the outside world after being unable to cope with the loss of Marni. As his disease rapidly worsens, Rotti offers Shilo GeneCo if she kills her father. When she refuses, Rotti uses the last of his strength to fatally shoot Nathan, and dies after disowning his children. After a tearful farewell to her father (""I Didn't Know I'd Love You So Much""), Shilo leaves, deciding that her father's actions do not dictate her future (""Genetic Emancipation"").
Shilo flees, leaving GeneCo with no legal heir. Amber inherits the company instead and auctions her fallen face to charity, which Pavi wins after Luigi kills the top three bidders.

== Production ==


=== Development ===
In 1996, Darren Smith had a friend who was going through bankruptcy and whose possessions were going into foreclosure. Inspired by this, Smith came up with the idea of a future where not only one's property, but also one's body parts, could be repossessed. Smith and Terrance Zdunich collaborated ideas and plot lines to create the first version of Repo!, titled The Necromerchant's Debt, which told the story of a Graverobber in debt to a Repo Organ Man. It premiered at the John Raitt theater in 2002. After being such a success, Smith and Zdunich expanded on the universe to create all of the storylines that became Repo! The Genetic Opera later in 2002. Many changes were made, gradually, to the characters and music throughout various incarnations through 2005. For example, Rotti, in the earliest performances, was not father to Luigi, Pavi and Amber. Instead, he was a younger brother to Luigi and Pavi, while Amber was Luigi's daughter. Lyrics were adjusted to new arcs and some songs were dropped altogether, such as ""But This Is Opera!"", cut out in an effort to change the direction of Mag's character.
After years of being performed as a stage play, Repo! was adapted into a ten-minute short film directed and financed by Darren Lynn Bousman to pitch the idea to film studios. The film starred Shawnee Smith as Amber Sweet (then named ""Heather Sweet""), Michael Rooker as the Repo Man, Kristen Fairlie as Shilo, Zdunich as GraveRobber and J. Larose as Pavi.


=== Filming ===
Once picked up by Lionsgate, principal photography began in September 2007 in Canada. The film was scheduled to be released on April 25, 2008, but was pushed back to November 7. X Japan leader Yoshiki produced the soundtrack, along with composing one extra track for the film.

== Reception ==


=== Critical response ===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 37% of 59 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.5/10. The website's consensus reads: ""Bombastic and intentionally gross, Repo! The Genetic Opera has a unique style but lacks the wit and substance to be involving."" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 32 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating ""generally unfavorable"" reviews.Kyle Smith of The New York Post concluded, ""There probably aren't enough futuristic Goth rock musicals, but Repo! The Genetic Opera is weak on a couple of things a musical needs: music and lyrics."" Nathan Lee for The New York Times declared the film ""feels destined to please a campy coterie of fans and no one else"" and criticized the music, saying, ""A few catchy melodies, some clever lyrics or even a sense that the score wasn't just one long, unmodulated track might have energized this singularly inert tale..."" Tasha Robinson  for The A.V. Club said, ""One of the main issues with Repo! The Genetic Opera is that nearly every aspect of it goes on too long. The songs are generally overextended, which is a particular problem given that most of them are also atonal and dull, either chanted or seemingly assembled from a series of clunky, ill-fitting, barely rhyming lines."" And ultimately ""...I spent the vast majority of the film either bored or squirming with discomfort over the cheap gore, the arrhythmic songs, and the phenomenally bombastic performances...""


=== Box office ===
Repo! grossed $53,684 in its opening weekend, a $6,711 average per theater. The film's full eleven-theater release earned $146,750 in the United States, and an additional $41,376 internationally, for a total of $188,126 worldwide.


=== Accolades ===
Hilton's performance won her the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress at the 29th Golden Raspberry Awards. The songs ""Chase the Morning"", ""Chromaggia"" and ""Zydrate Anatomy"" were shortlisted for the Academy Award for Best Original Song, although none were nominated.

Willy Russell,"William ""Willy"" Russell (born 23 August 1946) is an English dramatist, lyricist and composer. His best known works are Educating Rita, Shirley Valentine, Blood Brothers and Our Day Out.


== Early life ==
Russell was born in Whiston, Lancashire (which is now Merseyside). On leaving school, aged 15, he became a women's hairdresser, eventually running his own salon, until the age of 20 when he decided to go back to college. This led to him qualifying as a teacher. During these years, Russell also worked as a semi-professional singer, writing and performing his own songs in folk clubs.At college, he began writing drama and, in 1972, took a programme of two one-act plays to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, where they were seen by writer John McGrath, who recommended Russell to the Liverpool Everyman, which commissioned the adaptation, When The Reds…, Russell's first professional work for theatre.


== Career ==
Russell's first play was Keep Your Eyes Down (1971), written while he trained as a teacher at Saint Katherine's College of Higher Education in Liverpool and performed at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 1971.In 1974 Russell wrote John, Paul, George, Ringo ... and Bert, a musical about The Beatles. Commissioned by the Liverpool Everyman, it ran for a (then) unprecedented eight weeks before transferring to the West End where it ran for over a year, winning the Evening Standard and London Theatre Critics awards for the best musical of 1974. It premiered at the Everyman Theatre, Liverpool, and then transferred to the Lyric Theatre in the West End in 1974.Alongside further stage works, One for the Road (1976) and Stags and Hens (1978), Russell was a screenwriter with television films, Death of A Young Young Man (1975, BBC1), Daughters of Albion (1979), Our Day Out (1977) and the five-part serial One Summer (1983).Commissioned by the Royal Shakespeare Company, Educating Rita premiered at the Warehouse, London in 1980 and transferred to the West End Piccadilly Theatre, London in August 1980, and starred Julie Walters and Mark Kingston. Since its premiere and long West End run (the play ran to ""at least"" June 1982), the play has been translated and produced in almost every part the globe garnering awards both for its author and for many of the actors who have played the roles of Rita and Frank.Returning to the Liverpool Everyman in 1986, Russell wrote Shirley Valentine which went on to an acclaimed West End run, earning Olivier Awards for both its author (Comedy of the Year) and star Pauline Collins (Actress of the Year in a New Play). The play transferred to New York for a highly successful Broadway run in February 1989 to November 1989, and a Tony Award as Best Actress for Collins.Both Educating Rita (1983)  and Shirley Valentine (1989) became feature films with Michael Caine, Julie Walters and Pauline Collins all receiving Oscar nominations for their respective roles, as did Russell for his Educating Rita screenplay.Russell's other worldwide theatrical success has been Blood Brothers, ""a Liverpudlian folk opera"" about a pair of twins separated at birth and brought up in completely different environments. It won the Olivier Award for Best New Musical in 1983. Its 1988 revival had over 10,000 consecutive performances during its 24-year West End run, which ended in November 2012. Simultaneously, there were UK touring and international productions, including a two-year run on Broadway starting in 1993. The Broadway production was nominated for the 1993 Tony Award, Best Musical.In 1985, Russell co-wrote the song ""The Show"", the theme for the TV series Connie with series creator Ron Hutchinson. The song was performed by vocalist Rebecca Storm and released as a single by Towerbell Records in June 1985, reaching number 22 on the UK Singles Chart.
Russell (with musical collaborator Bob Eaton) realised a long-held ambition to develop Our Day Out further and after extensive rewriting, and recomposing created Our Day Out – The Musical. This modern musical retelling retains all the characters and plot of the original but with the action brought forward to today with a new score and lyrics to reflect this twenty first century setting. The musical was produced in 2010 at the Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool.The Wrong Boy, Willy Russell's first novel, was published in 2000. In 2004, Russell returned to his original singer/songwriter roots, releasing his album, Hoovering the Moon on Pure Records. Russell also co-produced the Tim Firth album Harmless Flirting.In 2013, the Archive and Special Collections department of Liverpool John Moores University established the Willy Russell Archive containing manuscripts, programmes, publicity and media material including newspaper cuttings and press releases, correspondence, legal, financial and administrative documents, records relating to the casting and audition process, audio and film material, and promotional ephemera. The material was produced throughout the course of Russell's career and is a comprehensive representation of his work to date. It also illustrates Russell's collaborative works, both written and musical.


== Personal life ==
In 1969, Russell married Annie Seagroatt; the couple have one son, Rob, and two daughters, Rachel and Ruth.

Leith Waterworld,"Leith Waterworld was a leisure pool in Leith, Edinburgh, Scotland. It was built on the site of the former Leith Central railway station. It was the only pool in Edinburgh with flumes, and there was also a fast river run. It was closed in January 2012 in order to save funds for the Royal Commonwealth Pool's renovation and re-opening. A campaigning group against the closure, called Splashback, were funded to carry out feasibility studies but the property has been converted into a children's soft-play centre.


== History ==
The pool opened in 1992, and was then closed in November 1999 after problems were found including tiles coming away from walls, electrical problems and rusting structures. It reopened in 2002 and a new multisensory play area was introduced in 2003. Repairs were estimated to have cost £270,000. There were previous threats to close the pool to save money in 1997 and 2005.On 22 December 2011 Edinburgh Council voted to close the pool. It closed on 8 January 2012. Campaigners continued to protest and lodged an official complaint against the closure. The closed pool became an issue in the Edinburgh 2012 elections, referenced at local hustings. In September 2012, Splashback's bid to reopen the facility was rejected and they were told to come back with a better submission. In May 2013 the decision was made to accept a proposal to redevelop the premises as a soft-play area. Splashback accused Edinburgh councillor Richard Lewis of breaking his word about reopening the pool.

== Flora ==
The dominant vegetation type of this ecoregion is coniferous forest. In contrast with Rocky Mountain ecoregions to the north, lodgepole pine is rather rare, replaced by Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides). Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii subsp. glauca), Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmanni), Subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), Limber pine (Pinus flexilis) and Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) can also be found in the mountain forests. Bristlecone pine (Pinus aristata) is the dominant plant at the tree line/krummholz zone. Aside from coniferous forests, the ecoregion contains meadows, foothill grasslands, riparian woodlands and alpine tundra.


== Fauna ==
Mammals include elk (Cervus canadensis), mule deer (Odocoileus hemonius), black bear (Ursus americanus), wolverine (Gulo gulo), North American cougar (Puma concolor), Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis), and American marten (Martes americana). Grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) may exist in this region but there has not been a confirmed sighting of a grizzly in Colorado since 1979. A load of bird species are found in this region including black-billed magpies (Pica hudsonia), Canada jays (Perisoreus canadensi), Steller's jay (Cyanocitta stelleri), broad-tailed hummingbirds (Selasphorus platycerus), dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis), and the threatened brown-capped rosy-finches (Leucosticte australis) and black rosy-finches (Leucosticte atrata).

Ultra Outlets of Medford,"Ultra Outlets of Medford is an outlet center located in Medford, Minnesota about 55 miles south of the Minneapolis–Saint Paul, Minnesota Metropolitan Area (Twin Cities). Originally opened as Medford Outlet Center in 1991, it was the first outlet center to open in Minnesota. It includes retailers such as Old Navy, Eddie Bauer, Bath & Body Works, Maurices, Famous Footwear and a variety of local businesses. For a brief time the outlet center was known as Preferred Outlets of Medford until it  reverted to its original name in 2011. Since 2015, the center has lost a significant amount of National and regional tenants, and could be considered a ‘dead’ mall.


== History ==
The center originally opened with 29 stores and later expanded to 54 stores with two anchor locations at the entrance. Since the early 2010s, the center has dwindled to only a dozen stores due to consumers changing habits such as online shopping and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, with the close proximity of the Albertville Premium Outlets in Albertville, Minnesota and the Twin Cities Premium Outlets in Eagan, Minnesota much of the traffic from the Twin Cities metropolitan area has disappeared. The center once included prominent retailers such as Coach, Liz Claiborne, Levi's, Nike, Gap, Rebok, Harry and David, and Toys ""R"" Us.


== Ultra Outlets ==
In 2016, the outlet center was sold to Ultra Outlets USA, a company based in Columbus, Ohio, for $2.3 million and was rebranded to Ultra Outlets of Medford. A number of major improvements to the infrastructure, design, and functionality of the center were made over the next few years including the repavement and new traffic configuration of the parking lot along with the addition of free public Wi-Fi. These improvements never came to fruition, with the new owners losing a significant amount of money on their investment. Property records show the property has declined by about 50% to $1.2 million in 2022. This significant decline has likely had significant implications for the small town of Medfords budget.

Jermall Charlo,"Jermall Charlo (; born May 19, 1990) is an American professional boxer. He has held world championships in two weight classes, including the WBC middleweight title since 2019 and previously the IBF light middleweight title from 2015 to 2017. His identical twin brother, Jermell Charlo, is also a professional boxer and unified WBC, WBA (Super) and IBF light middleweight world champion.


== Early life ==
Jermall is older than his identical twin Jermell by one minute. Both brothers are graduates of Alief Hastings High School in Houston, Texas.


== Amateur career ==
They began boxing when they started following their father, himself a former boxer, into the gym. As an amateur, Jermall was hopeful for a spot on the 2008 U.S. Olympic team but was forced to back out due to a toe injury. He competed in the amateur ranks for one more year and finished with a record of 65 wins and 6 losses.


== Professional career ==


=== Light middleweight ===


==== Early career ====
On August 12, 2008, Charlo made his professional debut against Cimmaron Davis and won the fight via 2nd-round technical knockout. On July 11, 2009, Charlo faced Deon Nash, the opponent his brother Jermell went up against and beat in 2008. Jermall won a comfortable unanimous decision victory and later fought Nash to a rematch on August 28, 2010, and Charlo would end up winning again by a corner retirement. On October 24, 2010, Charlo went up against Puerto Rican Carlos Garcia, whom his brother Jermell had fought a year prior. Both brothers beat Garcia by unanimous decision. Over the next five years, Charlo remained undefeated picking up wins over Orlando Lora, Antwone Smith and Norberto Gonzalez. By the close of 2014, Charlo had a record of 20 wins with 16 coming inside the distance and no losses.On March 28, 2015, Charlo went up against a highly talented prospect, Michael Kenneth Finney (12-2-1, 10 KOs) at The Pearl, Palms Casino in Las Vegas. Charlo won all of the rounds on all 3 judges scorecards and won a unanimous decision victory. The fight nearly came to an end a few times during the fight, however Finney managed to take Charlo the distance for the fifth time in his career.


==== Charlo vs. Bundrage ====
In May 2015, 42 year old Cornelius Bundrage (34-5, 19 KOs) was ordered by the IBF to make a mandatory title defense against Charlo. July 25 was a potential date discussed initially. On June 8, a few weeks prior to the fight taking place, Bundrage was forced to pull out of the fight citing an injury above his left eye. The card, which was scheduled to July 18 was postponed. The deep cut happened during a sparring session. On August 17, it was confirmed the fight would take place at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Ledyard, Connecticut, on September 12. After an 18-month wait, Charlo dismantled Bundrage and captured the IBF light middleweight title with a dominating third-round knockout win. Bundrage was knocked down once in rounds 1 and 2 and twice in round 3. An overhand right put Bundrage down in round 1. Charlo never allowed Bundrage to get into the fight, constantly applying pressure. The second knockdown, which occurred in round 2 was from a left jab. Fast combinations to the head dropped Bundrage early in round 3 and a couple of minutes later, a final blow to the head. The referee did attempt to make a count and stopped the fight at 2 minutes and 33 seconds. After the fight, Bundrage said, ""I hand't fought in (11 months), you can't be inactive fighting these young guys.""


==== Charlo vs. Campfort ====
A few weeks after winning the title, Charlo's trainer Ronnie Shields confirmed that Charlo would make his first defence against veteran Wilky Campfort (21-1, 12 KOs) on November 28, 2015, at The Bomb Factory in Dallas, Texas. Campfort's sole loss on his record came in his second professional fight via majority decision after 4 rounds. Shield's, who had been training both the twins, recently confirmed he would no longer be working with Jermell. He stated it was on good terms and it would not affect how Jermall would perform. Charlo floored Campfort in round 2 with a counter right hand. He recorded a second knockdown the following round after a flurry in the corner forced Campfort to take a voluntary knee. Towards the end of round 3 Charlo hit a perfect left uppercut clean to his left eye of Campfort's, compromising his vision was instantly to take a knee again. Despite beating the count, Campfort complained that he was unable to see, causing referee Mark Calo-Oy to wave off the fight. Over the 4 rounds, Charlo out landed Campfort 62-11, connecting on 30% of his power shots. After the bout, Charlo confirmed he would stay at light middleweight and continue to defend his title, however he wanted big fights. He also praised his jab, calling it the best in the business.


==== Charlo vs. Trout ====
On March 29, 2016, it was announced that Charlo would make a defence against former world champion Austin Trout (30-2, 17 KOs) at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas in Las Vegas, Nevada on May 21. The card also included top light middleweights Erislandy Lara, Vanes Martirosyan and his brother Jermell. In a close contested bout, Charlo defeated Trout by a 12-round unanimous decision. The judges' scored the fight 115-113, 116-112, 116-112. Charlo landed the harder shots to dominate the action in the first six rounds. However, Charlo seemed to gas out a little in the second half of the fight, and was outworked by Trout. Trout suffered a cut over his right eye in the 10th round from a clash of heads but fought well despite suffering the cut. The crowd booed loudly when the scores were read out to let the judges know that they felt Trout should have won. Charlo landed 130 of 474 punches thrown (27%) and Trout landed 117 of his 490 thrown (24%). Trout received a purse of $300,000 and Charlo earned a purse of $500,000.


==== Charlo vs. Williams ====
Charlo's next title defense was set to be against the No. 1 contender Julian Williams (22-0-1, 14 KOs) on December 10, 2016, at the USC Galen Center in Los Angeles, California. The fight was pushed back as Charlo was nursing an eye injury and was given a 60-day medical extension by IBF. There were also rumours that Charlo would vacate the title to move up to middleweight. Charlo retained his IBF light middleweight title with a fifth round stoppage of Williams. Charlo dropped Williams in the second round with a powerful jab. Williams came back and fought a clever fight, making Charlo miss, slipping punches, landing some good counters. In round 5, Charlo landed a right uppercut, dropping Williams hard. Williams got up, however Charlo went for the finish, and got it with a third knockdown after a barrage of punches ending with a left hook. After the referee stopped the fight, Williams went over to congratulate Charlo. Charlo didn't want to embrace and told Williams,""I don't want your congratulations, I want your apology."" The crowd noticing the heat between the two corners started to boo Charlo. In the post fight interview, Charlo stated Williams had disrespected him leading up to the fight, he also called out Canelo and Golovkin, stating he would move up to middleweight. The fight aired on Showtime and averaged 321,000 viewers, peaking at 370,000 viewers.


=== Middleweight ===
Charlo officially vacated his IBF light middleweight title on February 16, 2017, in order to move up to middleweight. Charlo had wanted to unify the light middleweight division, but there were no titlists available. At the time, twin Jermell, who Jermall had vowed not to fight, held the WBC title. He also stated after the Williams fight that he had been struggling to make weight. Charlo told ESPN, ""It was either going to be a big fight for me at 154 pounds, like against Miguel Cotto or Canelo Alvarez, something big like that, or move up,"" On March 11, WBC ranked Charlo number 2 ahead of David Lemieux and Curtis Stevens, who were ranked number 3 and 4 respectively. The IBF gave Charlo a number 3 ranking. In March 2017, it was reported by ESPN Deportes that an announcement would be made for Charlo to fight WBC number 1 ranked, Argentinian boxer Jorge Sebastian Heiland in a final eliminator.


==== Charlo vs. Heiland ====
On June 5, 2017, reports circulated around Argentina that WBC mandatory challenger Jorge Sebastian Heiland (28-4-2, 15 KOs) would be ordered to fight Charlo in a final eliminator. Heiland had been the mandatory since 2015. Early talks indicated the fight could take place on the undercard of the Mikey Garcia vs. Adrien Broner undercard. On June 9, the WBC officially ordered the fight between the two, with the winner becoming the mandatory challenger for the winner of Canelo Álvarez vs. Gennady Golovkin, which would take place in September 2017. The fight was officially announced on June 27. Charlo weighed in a career high 159.2 pounds while Heiland came in slightly lighter at 158.2 pounds.Charlo became the mandatory challenger for the WBC middleweight title, with a stoppage win over an injured Heiland in round 4. At the start of the fight, it was clear that Heiland's left leg was injured. Charlo first dropped Heiland in round 2 with a left to the head. In round 4, Charlo landed another left hook to the head which dropped Heiland again. Heiland beat the count, but as he was getting up, he stumbled around due to the injury. Referee Benji Esteves stopped the fight immediately at 2:13 of the fourth round to ensure Heiland took no more punishment. Charlo spoke to Showtime's Jim Gray in the post fight interview, ""Sometimes the injury can be a decoy. You never want to just jump in and think it's part of his game plan. My coach [Ronnie Shields] told me to stay behind my job like I did, continue to work and it's gonna come."" The ringside doctor checked Heiland's leg before the fourth round but let the action continue. Heiland stated that his leg was okay before the fight and the injury occurred in the opening round. Charlo earned $350,000 compared to Heiland who had $200,000 purse. The fight drew an average 500,000 viewers and peaked at 542,000 viewers on Showtime.


==== Charlo vs. Centeno ====
On November 21, 2017, the WBC announced that Charlo would have the opportunity to claim the Interim WBC middleweight title against Hugo Centeno (26-1, 14 KOs). WBC President Maurcio Sulaiman explained the reason for this being due to the full WBC title being tied up in a potential rematch between Golovkin and Álvarez. A possible date in January 2018 was being discussed at the time. Due to negotiations not being made, on January 2, 2018, Sulaiman ordered the fight and confirmed it would be sanctioned by the WBC for the interim championship. On January 23, the fight was made official to take place on the undercard of Deontay Wilder's WBC heavyweight title defence against Luis Ortiz on March 3 at the Barclays Center. On February 23, the fight was postponed after Centeno injured his ribs in training. The fight was quickly rescheduled to take place on April 21 on the Adrien Broner vs. Jessie Vargas undercard. On fight night, in front of  13,964 in attendance, Charlo won the vacant WBC interim middleweight title after knocking out Centeno in round 2. The knockdown came when Charlo landed a left hook to the head followed by a right hand to Centeno. The fight was promptly halted by referee Steve Willis. The official time was at 0:55 of round 2. Charlo spend the first round stalking Centeno, who was reluctant to exchange. After the fight, Charlo said, ""I'm a two-time world champion. Bring on Triple G! I want that fight! The networks [HBO and Showtime] and the teams can figure out how to get the Triple G fight done. I have the best manager [Al Haymon] in the world. I'm 27-0 with 21 knockouts. Everybody sees it. What more can I say?"" CompuBox Stats showed that Charlo landed 12 of 35 punches thrown (34%) and Centeno landed 10 of his 31 thrown (32%). Charlo earned $500,000 to Centeno's $235,000 purse.


==== Charlo vs. Korobov ====
In October 2018, Premier Boxing Champions announced a doubleheader for December 22, 2018, at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. The card, which would be televised by FOX, would feature Jermell Charlo defending his WBC light middleweight title against Tony Harrison and Jermall Charlo defending his WBC interim middleweight title against former world title challenger Willie Monroe Jr. (23-3, 6 KOs). The twins flipped a coin to see who would close the show. The official press conference took place on October 25. On December 15, a week before the fight, it was reported that the WBC had been alerted of an adverse finding in Monroe's pre-fight drug test. It was reported that Russian boxer Matt Korobov (28-1, 14 KOs), who was scheduled to fight on the untelevised undercard against Juan DeAngel, stepped up to the challenge. Koborov, usually fighting at the light heavyweight limit, was dropping down to super middleweight to fight DeAngel, and now had six days to come down to 160 pounds from super middleweight. The WBC issued a statement confirmed Monroe would not be able to challenge Charlo for the title. They also confirmed the adverse finding was a banned steroidal substance. According to the sample collector, Monroe disclosed that he had used a non-specific “testosterone booster”, as written in the Doping Control Form, however did not request a 'therapeutic Use Exception' for the substance. Charlo vs. Korobov was confirmed on December 17. Korobov had only two pounds to lose as it was revealed the contracted weight limit for his fight against DeAngel was 162 pounds.


==== Charlo vs. Adams ====
On 29 June 2019, Charlo fought Brandon Adams, who was ranked #12 by the WBC at middleweight. Adams came out to box, and was tricky at times for Charlo. However, Charlo still managed to dominate throughout most of the fight, winning it via a wide unanimous decision. Two of the judges had Charlo winning 120-108 and one had it 119-109 for the champion.


==== Charlo vs. Hogan ====
On 7 December 2019, Charlo defended his WBC middleweight title against Dennis Hogan. Hogan was ranked #5 by the WBC at middleweight. Charlo dropped Hogan twice, once in the fourth and once in the seventh round, en route to a seventh round TKO victory. Hogan managed to get up from the second knockdown in the seven round, but the referee decided to end the fight and award Charlo the TKO victory.


==== Charlo vs. Derevyanchenko ====
On 26 September 2020, Charlo defended his belt against WBC #1 and The Ring #4 at middleweight, Sergiy Derevyanchenko. In what was probably his toughest opponent up to date, Charlo used a powerful jab, showed a good chin and a variety of shots to outpoint Derevyanchenko to a unanimous decision win, with scores of 116-112, 117-111, 118-110, and retain his WBC belt.


==== Charlo vs. Montiel ====
On June 19, 2021, Charlo successfully defended his title for the fourth time against unheralded challenger Juan Macias Montiel. Charlo was in control throughout the fight, winning a unanimous decision with scores of 118-109, 119-109, 120-108.


==== Charlo vs. Benavidez Jr ====
On November 25, 2023, in Las Vegas, Charlo  faced José Benavidez Jr. in a 10-round non-title middleweight bout. He won the bout by unanimous decision.

Hurricane Gonzalo,"Hurricane Gonzalo was the second tropical cyclone, after Hurricane Fay, to directly strike the island of Bermuda in a one-week time frame in October 2014, and was the first Category 4 Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane Ophelia in 2011. At the time, it was the strongest hurricane in the Atlantic since Igor in 2010. Gonzalo struck Bermuda less than a week after the surprisingly fierce Hurricane Fay; 2014 was the first season in recorded history to feature two hurricane landfalls in Bermuda. A powerful Atlantic tropical cyclone that wrought destruction in the Leeward Islands and Bermuda, Gonzalo was the seventh named storm, sixth and final hurricane and only the second major hurricane of the below-average 2014 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm formed from a tropical wave on October 12, while located east of the Lesser Antilles. It made landfall on Antigua, Saint Martin, and Anguilla as a Category 1 hurricane, causing damage on those and nearby islands. Antigua and Barbuda sustained US$40 million in losses, and boats were abundantly damaged or destroyed throughout the northern Leeward Islands. The storm killed three people on Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy. Gonzalo tracked northwestward as it intensified into a major hurricane. Eyewall replacement cycles led to fluctuations in the hurricane's structure and intensity, but on October 16, Gonzalo peaked with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph (235 km/h).
After Hurricane Fay caused extensive power outages on the island just days before, residents of Bermuda were forced to complete preparations for Gonzalo in haste. Banks, businesses, schools, and government offices closed in advance of the storm, while the Royal Navy ship HMS Argyll left its post in the Caribbean to provide Bermuda with emergency assistance. The cyclone gradually weakened before crossing directly over central Bermuda at Category 2 strength around 00:30 UTC on October 18. Gonzalo battered the island with wind gusts as high as 144 mph (232 km/h), downing hundreds of trees and creating widespread roof damage. At the height of the storm, about 31,000 out of 36,000 total electricity customers were without power; service was not fully restored until early November. Many roads were impassable immediately following the hurricane, and in many cases, the damage done by Gonzalo was indistinguishable from that of Fay. Bermuda Regiment soldiers and sailors from the Argyll took part in initial cleanup and repairs on the territory, and preliminary assessments revealed that the storm did not compare to the devastation of Hurricane Fabian in 2003. Catastrophe modelling firms estimated that Bermuda suffered at least $200 million in insured losses, and despite the heavy disruptions, no deaths or serious injuries were reported there.
Departing Bermuda, Gonzalo accelerated toward the waters of the North Atlantic, passing close to southeastern Newfoundland before becoming extratropical on October 19. Gusty winds and bands of heavy rain in the southeastern Avalon Peninsula engendered minor flooding and power outages. A large storm system involving the remnants of Gonzalo battered the British Isles and central Europe on October 21, killing three people in the United Kingdom and severely hindering transportation. The system later played a role in triggering torrential rains over the Balkans, which resulted in severe flooding in Greece and Bulgaria.


== Meteorological history ==
Hurricane Gonzalo originated from a tropical wave that emerged from the western coast of Africa on October 4 and trekked across the Atlantic. Despite an attendant expanse of clouds and thunderstorms, hostile winds from an upper-level trough hindered cyclogenesis. On October 10, after encountering an eastward-propagating Kelvin wave, the system developed more concentrated convection. With conditions increasingly favorable for further development, the disturbance gradually became better organized, forming a small low-pressure area by October 11. In turn, a tropical depression formed at 00:00 UTC on October 12, located approximately 390 mi (630 km) east of the Leeward Islands. Continued maturation amid warm waters and low wind shear yielded Tropical Storm Gonzalo 12 hours later. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not begin issuing advisories on the cyclone until midday on October 12, after a Hurricane Hunter flight into the system reported surface winds of 40 mph (65 km/h).A powerful ridge over the central Atlantic steered the nascent storm westward toward the Lesser Antilles. Thunderstorm activity was strong near the center was initially somewhat disorganized and asymmetric. However, a tight inner core soon took shape, and Gonzalo began to quickly intensify throughout the day on October 12. Following the appearance of an eye feature early the next day, the storm was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane while located near Antigua in the eastern Caribbean. Shortly thereafter, the storm passed directly over the island. The hurricane later struck Saint Martin and Anguilla, and skirted just north of the British Virgin Islands while continuing to intensify. By that time, it was headed toward the northwest around the periphery of the aforementioned ridge.
On October 14, the eye contracted to a diameter of 17 mi (27 km) and improved its satellite presentation. At 18:00 UTC, Gonzalo strengthened to a Category 3 major hurricane while located about 170 mi (275 km) north of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Six hours later it became the first Category 4 hurricane in the Atlantic basin since Hurricane Ophelia in 2011. Subsequently, a concentric eyewall structure indicated an imminent eyewall replacement cycle, with the inner feature ""about as small as it can get"" according to the NHC. The eyewall replacement cycle briefly disrupted the storm's core, causing Gonzalo to weaken slightly, but upon completion on the evening of October 15, the system stabilized and resumed intensification. While moving northward early the next day, Gonzalo reached its peak intensity with winds of 145 mph (235 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 940 mbar (hPa; 27.76 inHg). By evening it had turned north-northeastward, ahead of an advancing trough over the eastern United States and in the wake of the receding ridge.From the evening of October 16 through the next morning, the hurricane experienced further internal fluctuations as it approached Bermuda from the south-southwest. Concurrently, the storm began to weaken. In particular, cloud tops around the hurricane warmed, and convection became less uniform, likely attributable to cooler waters and heightened wind shear. The hurricane was downgraded to Category 2 as the northern eyewall crossed Bermuda, and about 00:30 UTC on October 18, the center of circulation passed directly over the island, signaling an official landfall. Along with Hurricane Fay, which struck Bermuda on October 12, this represented the first recorded instance of two hurricanes making landfall on the island within the same season. Moving away from Bermuda, the hurricane continued to degrade, but showed signs of increased organization later on October 18. As Gonzalo accelerated northeastward at over 50 mph (80 km/h), it passed about 50 miles (80 km) southeast of Newfoundland's Avalon Peninsula early on October 19. In spite of sea surface temperatures below 50 °F (10 °C), the storm was able to maintain a central dense overcast and deep warm core. By 18:00 UTC, Gonzalo had finally succumbed to the cold environment and intense wind shear, completing its transition into a strong extratropical cyclone about 460 mi (740 km) northeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Gonzalo's remnants sped east-northeastward until a frontal boundary absorbed it on October 20, to the south-southwest of Iceland. The resultant system brought stormy weather to the British Isles and parts of mainland Europe on October 21, and later contributed to the formation of a large cut-off low.


== Preparations ==
When Gonzalo first formed, various governments across the eastern Caribbean issued tropical cyclone warnings and watches, extending from Guadeloupe to the coast of Puerto Rico. As the storm was strengthening and moving through the region, a hurricane warning was issued for the British Virgin Islands, Anguilla, and Saint Martin. Several major cruise lines altered their itineraries to avoid the storm.Late on October 14, while Gonzalo was still about 700 miles (1,125 km) to the south, the Bermuda Weather Service issued a hurricane watch for the island. The watch was upgraded to a warning the next day. Having been affected by the unexpectedly destructive Hurricane Fay just days earlier, residents quickly began preparing for Gonzalo by obtaining emergency supplies and expediting cleanup efforts from the previous storm. Premier of Bermuda Michael Dunkley advised citizens to complete most preparations by the afternoon of October 16. Banks and businesses began closing that day, while schools and government offices were closed by October 17. One school functioned as a storm shelter, and 66 people ultimately sought refuge there. Bus and ferry services were suspended on the evening of October 16. Bermuda's only daily newspaper, the Royal Gazette, did not go to print on October 17, but distributed the next day's edition for free. Bermuda Regiment soldiers were stationed at various points to support emergency response crews and ensure the safety of the public.The Caribbean Electric Utility Services Corporation (CARILEC) sent linemen to assist the Bermuda Electric Light Company (BELCO) crews in the event of power outages from Gonzalo. Still completing restoration work after massive outages from Fay, BELCO stationed vehicles and supplies at strategic points on the island to prepare for the next hurricane. On the morning of October 16, BELCO switched its focus from Fay to Gonzalo, leaving around 1,500 households without power; the remaining affected customers were asked to refrain from calling to report outages. Ahead of the storm, the Royal Navy frigate HMS Argyll sailed from the Caribbean to provide Bermuda with emergency assistance. Public beaches were closed as hurricane swells began to build, and the decision was made to shut down the Causeway early on October 17, based on forecasts of long-duration severe winds. Additionally, L.F. Wade International Airport closed prior to the storm's onslaught, accounting for 62 canceled commercial flights. Three cruise ships were diverted from the island.


== Impact and aftermath ==


=== Caribbean ===
While moving through the northeastern Leeward Islands as a fledgling hurricane, Gonzalo produced sustained winds of 77 mph (124 km/h) on Antigua, with gusts to 90 mph (140 km/h). Roads were blocked by uprooted trees, while numerous buildings, including several schools, received significant damage. Gonzalo caused an island-wide power outage, and its storm surge damaged boats. Schools and businesses were forced to close, and four emergency shelters opened to storm victims. Debris and flooding forced V. C. Bird International Airport to delay its return to operation after closing as a precaution. Numerous homes sustained damage, largely to their roofs, with the Saint George Parish suffering the greatest losses. Farming communities and a variety of crops were severely impacted, which sparked concerns of imminent produce shortages. Some growers lost their entire banana crops.Barbuda experienced gusts as high as 70 mph (110 km/h), as well as radar-estimated rainfall of up to 6 in (150 mm). Although Barbuda was subject to less widespread devastation than its twin island, there were still snapped tree limbs, reports of flooding, and disruptions to utility services. Damages to residences, government buildings, and agriculture on Antigua contributed to Antigua and Barbuda's national storm cost of around US$40 million, which also includes compensation to American Airlines for not meeting departing passenger quotas during the hurricane. Numerous individuals were treated for minor storm-related injuries, none of them life-threatening. Further west, Gonzalo caused minor power outages on Saint Kitts and Nevis, while a general 1–2 in (25–51 mm) of rain accompanied wind gusts to 58 mph (93 km/h) on Guadeloupe.
The storm wrecked dozens of boats around Saint Martin, including 22 in Simpson Bay Lagoon, and an elderly man aboard one of the stricken vessels was killed. Two people on Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy went missing in the storm, and were presumed dead after remaining unaccounted for several months later. Fourteen other missing individuals were returned alive. Winds on Saint Barthélemy blew 86 mph (138 km/h) sustained, with gusts to 126 mph (203 km/h). Fallen trees obstructed streets, and an aircraft flipped over on a runway at Gustaf III Airport. As many as 40 boats were reportedly beached on Saint Barthélemy.On Saint Martin, sustained winds exceeded 60 mph (95 km/h), and L'Espérance Airport recorded gusts to 93 mph (150 km/h) before the observing equipment failed. As much as 5.70 in (145 mm) of rain fell over the island. Reports of urban flooding and entrance of water into homes were common. Gonzalo impaired water and electricity services throughout Dutch Sint Marteen and inflicted significant damage to homes. The St. Maarten Zoo sustained heavy structural damage, though all resident animals survived unharmed. The French side of the island incurred relatively little destruction, with scattered roof and window damage, though Orient Beach ""was a scene of complete devastation""; several businesses there suffered extensively. Emergency responders and military aircraft from Martinique were dispatched to aid in post-storm recovery on Saint Barthélemy and Saint Martin.Heavy rain on Anguilla flooded the Clayton J. Lloyd International Airport and portions of several districts, qualifying the government for a US$500,000 ""excess rainfall"" insurance payout. The eastern and western ends of the island bore the brunt of the storm, facing damage to utility poles, vegetation, and roofs, and public schools did not reopen until October 20 or later. The sole hospital experienced minor flood damage.Gonzalo produced squally weather in parts of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, causing power outages and prompting 20 people to stay in an emergency shelter. Cyril E. King Airport on Saint Thomas was temporarily closed due to the storm; the airport endured blustery conditions, with gusts reaching 35 mph (56 km/h). Elsewhere, rough seas affected parts of the Greater Antilles and the Bahamas.


=== Bermuda ===
Gonzalo generated hurricane-force winds across Bermuda over a period of about six hours, at their strongest from the northwest on the backside of the storm. Tropical storm conditions persisted for up to 24 hours. Elevated weather stations observed the highest winds; Commissioner's Point recorded 10-minute sustained winds of 109 mph (175 km/h), and St. David's measured gusts as high as 144 mph (232 km/h). Gusts reached 113 mph (182 km/h) at the Causeway, closer to sea level. The airport recorded 2.85 in (72 mm) of rain, but due to the strong winds, this was most likely an underestimation of what actually fell. The passage of the hurricane's eye was marked by diminished winds and a lack of rain, but a drizzle of ocean mist reportedly fell over the island. As Gonzalo struck at low tide, the effects of storm surge were minimal. At Esso Pier on the north side of the island, storm tides peaked at 3.25 ft (0.99 m) above normal.The intense winds brought down utility poles and hundreds of trees (likely exacerbated by saturated ground from record rainfall in the months prior), leaving ""barely a road"" passable. The storm razed several invasive species, with endemic trees proving more resilient. A composting facility received 1,200 truckloads of plant debris per day after Fay and Gonzalo, up from an average of 100. Damage from the storms totaled around US$260,000 on Bermuda National Trust properties, which include nature preserves and cemeteries. Similarly, the Bermuda Botanical Gardens and Arboretum were closed due to safety hazards resulting from extensive vegetation damage.
The first storm-related power outages took place in the early afternoon on October 17 as weather conditions worsened. At the height of the storm, about 31,000 out of 36,000 electricity customers were without power, including the 1,500 outages left unresolved after Fay. Backup CARILEC crews helped with specialty assignments, such as commercial outages and homes without power since before Gonzalo's onslaught. Service was not fully restored until November 3, and BELCO ultimately spent US$2.9 million on system repairs after hurricanes Fay and Gonzalo. The company replaced 228 utility poles, 80 transformers, and over four miles (6.4 km) of wire. Other utilities, such as television and Internet services, also suffered, and technicians handled individual outages deep into the month of November. About six hundred streetlights on main roads and several hundred more on side-streets were inoperative following the hurricane; some remained unmended through January 2015.Structural damage ranged from the superficial to complete wall or roof failure, the latter being relatively uncommon. A multitude of buildings, including churches, a visitor's center, the House of Assembly building in Hamilton, and the Bermuda Police Service headquarters at Prospect Camp, suffered some degree of roof damage. Older structures were particularly prone to substantial damage, as were commercial storage buildings subject to less strict building codes. In December, five new slate quarries were approved to accommodate the demand for roofing materials. Both the new and the old portions of King Edward VII Memorial Hospital received significant damage that exposed the facilities to the elements. An exhibit at the Bermuda Aquarium, Museum and Zoo was unroofed, and coastal erosion threatened to encroach on the site, though no animals were harmed. Part of the structure's roof was blown a one-quarter mile (400 m).L.F. Wade International Airport sustained some roof and runway lighting damage, and the Bermuda Weather Service building lost a storm shutter and saw water forced inside a communications room. A restaurant at the site of the Gibbs Hill Lighthouse was severely damaged, requiring a complete roof replacement. The Causeway was largely spared, with some damage to the safety walls alongside the road, and it was partially reopened on October 18 after initial repairs. However, one of two lanes remained shut down for several days. Many boats were washed ashore and damaged or wrecked by the storm, and other vessels tipped over in boatyards. According to preliminary estimates, properties in the Dockyard alone incurred US$1 million (2014 BMD) in damage.
The strongest hurricane to directly affect Bermuda since 2003's Hurricane Fabian, Gonzalo was generally less destructive. Damage modelling firms estimated insured losses from the hurricane to settle between US$200 million and US$400 million, not including damage to watercraft, though the CEO of the largest property insurer on Bermuda believed losses to be much lower. It was estimated that a Fabian equivalence in 2014 would cause about US$650 million in damage. Some insurance companies decided to treat Fay and Gonzalo as a single event, allowing one deductible to count toward claims from both storms. After initial assessments, Premier Dunkley reported that the territory fared ""much better than we expected"", and the storm was not blamed for any deaths or major injuries on Bermuda.In the aftermath of the hurricane, a Royal Navy helicopter aboard Argyll flew out ahead of the ship to start aerial damage assessments. Members of the Bermuda Regiment immediately began cleanup and recovery efforts, while the government provided tarps to affected homeowners. Sailors from the Argyll teamed up with Regiment soldiers upon the ship's arrival to continue relief work. Some 35 of the vessel's crew worked to clear debris from the runway at the airport, which reopened on October 19 after thorough evaluations. Including damage from Fay, about $2 million was spent on airport repairs, and the storms were later cited as evidence of the need for a newer terminal in a more protected location. All schools on the territory resumed classes by October 21.


=== Atlantic Canada ===
On October 17, the Canadian Hurricane Centre issued a tropical storm watch for the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland, between Arnold's Cove and Chapel's Cove. Some communities, including St. John's, worked to clear debris from culverts and storm drains to minimize the effects of flooding. Outer rainbands produced up to 2.7 in (69 mm) of rain in just a few hours, which produced localized urban flooding in St. John's. Winds gusted to 66 mph (106 km/h) at Cape Pine and 55 mph (89 km/h) at Cape Race. At St. John's International Airport, sustained winds of 34 mph (55 km/h) were punctuated by gusts to 46 mph (74 km/h). The winds briefly cut power to about 100 households in a St. John's neighborhood. Offshore, a buoy over the Laurentian fan recorded peak wave heights to 68 ft (21 m), and an oil rig southeast of the storm's center experienced sustained winds of 98 mph (158 km/h). Low astronomical tides prevented significant coastal flooding, but a 2.6 ft (0.8 m) surge was recorded at both St. John's and Argentia. Farther west, the hurricane generated rough seas and rip currents along the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia.


=== United Kingdom and Europe ===
The extratropical storm complex incorporating the remnants of Gonzalo generated strong winds across the British Isles, especially over Ireland and the northern United Kingdom. Winds gusted to 88 mph (142 km/h) at Oban in western Scotland, while gusts exceeding 60 mph (95 km/h) were common elsewhere. The system halted transportation throughout the region, forcing the cancellation of more than a hundred flights at London Heathrow Airport, grounding ferries, and blocking roads and railways with debris. Falling trees killed one woman near Hyde Park, London, and injured several others. In Essex, the winds collapsed a car jack supporting a van, fatally crushing a man working underneath. The storm triggered minor power outages in Scotland and Wales, with more extensive outages in northwestern Ireland after gusts as high as 115 km/h (71 mph).
Western and central Europe were also impacted by damaging winds and downpours. The coast of the Netherlands endured high seas and gusts to 108 km/h (67 mph), uprooting trees and flooding the coastline. Rail services and flight operations were disrupted throughout the region. In Germany, gusts over 145 km/h (90 mph) were recorded at high elevations. In Stuttgart alone, fifty vehicles were damaged by falling debris; downed trees, torn roofs, and power outages were common throughout the nation. In the Bavarian capital of Munich, the storm destroyed a large tin roof measuring over 80 m2 (860 sq ft), parts of which impacted cars and fences on the ground. Damage from the incident was estimated at €500,000 (US$637,000). Throughout Germany, the storm wrought €60–100 million (US$80–130 million) in insured losses. A woman died in a traffic accident, attributed to wet road conditions, along the Bundesstraße 303 in the Bayreuth district. Northwesterly gales yielded a storm surge along the country's North Sea coastline, with tides running over 2 m (6 ft 7 in) above normal along the Elbe River at Hamburg. Neighboring Austria and Switzerland also experienced gales and power outages. A tornado touched down near Neukirchen an der Enknach in Austria, damaging homes and farms. Gusts in southern Switzerland reached 185 km/h (115 mph), leading to road and rail closures. In southern France, the system initiated a mistral wind event.The upper-level low associated with the hurricane's remnants blanketed parts of the Alps with heavy snowfall, accumulating to several feet, and subsequently fueled torrential rains in the Balkans on October 24 and 25. Floodwaters caused by estimated rainfall totals nearing 150 mm (6 in) inundated entire villages in southeastern Bulgaria, forcing hundreds to evacuate, and there were widespread disruptions of power and water services. A woman in Burgas died from drowning. In the Greek capital city of Athens, the deluge filled streets with rushing water that swept away hundreds of vehicles. More than three hundred buildings were inundated in the Attica area.

=== Critical reviews ===
""Animal Control"" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Katie Rife of The A.V. Club gave the episode a ""B+"" grade and wrote, ""After the events of this week's What We Do In The Shadows, I can only assume that once the vampires succeed in taking over Staten Island, the employees of the municipal Animal Control department will be paraded through the streets in shirts made of cat hair as they're pelted with feces by passers-by, before they're corralled into a giant blender and whipped up into a human smoothie upon which all the creatures of the night can feast. How else to repay the indignity visited upon Laszlo this episode, after gluttony for blood leads him on an adventure that ends with him running down the street while under attack from half a dozen yowling, scratching cats?""Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode a 4 star rating out of 5 and wrote, ""After the running display of vampire clichés feeding the show, this is something to look forward to. What We Do in the Showers isn't anemic when it comes to the laughs tonight, even if the episode is sweeter than a diabetic's blood."" Greg Wheeler of The Review Geek gave the episode a 4 star rating out of 5 and wrote, ""With only 22 minutes to play with, What We Do In The Shadows makes the most of its limited run-time with an episode chock full of drama and comedy. There's a great array of jokes here too, playing on the tropes inherent with the series, complete with fourth wall breaks and the continued mockumentary style.""

In later years she sang with her son Lázaro, and was usually accompanied by the conjunto Campo Alegre.Initially, her music was mainly that of the European countryside guajiro (peasant), with lyrics based on the poetics of décima. The musical form was often that of the punto cubano. The relationship with Ñico Saquito taught her a great deal about the son and the guaracha, and her later work made frequent use of those forms.

Murali Kartik,"Murali Kartik (, born 11 September 1976) is an Indian cricket commentator and former cricketer who sporadically represented the national team from 2000 to 2007. He was a specialist slow left arm orthodox bowler known for his loopy trajectory and ability to spin and bounce, but  was not selected for international matches during his prime years due to the presence of Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh. He was also a left-handed batsman, and although he has had some success with the bat at first-class level with 21 half-centuries, he was not  able to repeat this at international level.After starting out in the Delhi junior system, Murali moved through the age group ranks at Railways, and was selected for the Indian Under-19 team. He made his first-class debut in 1996–97 and after a few productive seasons at the domestic level, made his Test debut in early-2000 as Kumble's bowling partner. However, he ran into disciplinary problems and was expelled from the National Cricket Academy in the same year, while new national captain Sourav Ganguly was reluctant to entrust him with responsibility. Ganguly called for off spinner Harbhajan Singh to be recalled in 2001, and was rewarded with a series-winning performance against Australia. This entrenched the off spinner in the team and left Kartik on the outer.
For the next four years, Kartik was on the fringes of selection. He made his ODI debut in 2002, however a series of disappointing performances lead to him missing the 2003 Cricket World Cup. He was recalled in late-2003 for limited overs matches and played in approximately half of India's matches over a six-month period, as well as one Test after Harbhajan suffered a serious injury. In late-2004 Kartik played in three Tests as India fielded three spinners, and claimed his only man-of-the-match award in Tests against Australia in Mumbai, but was again dropped two matches later. In late 2005, Murali became a regular member of the ODI team for a few months when the International Cricket Council introduced an experimental rule that allowed one substitute to be used, opening an extra vacancy in the national team. However, Kartik was unable to secure his position in the team and the rule was later revoked. In late 2007, Kartik broke back into the ODI team and took 6/27 in one victory over Australia, but lost form soon after and was again dropped. He has not represented India since then. 
Aside from domestic cricket, Kartik played for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League and has been in demand in English county cricket as an overseas player, representing Lancashire, Middlesex, Somerset and Surrey.Kartik has been part of the IPL commentary team since 2015 and regularly commentates on the Indian national team's home games.


== Early life ==
Born on 11 September 1976 in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, Murali Kartik wanted to be a genetic engineer. He was a medium pacer in his early years, before switching to a left arm finger spinner in the classical mould. Kartik grew up trying to emulate past Indian orthodox spinners Bishen Singh Bedi, Maninder Singh and Venkatapathy Raju. He also garnered attention for what was perceived to be a fiery attitude, but took pride in coach Kapil Dev saying of him, ""I have never seen a player with such an attitude towards the game in my 20 years of international cricket"".Kartik started out in the junior system at Delhi. He broke into their Under-16 team in December 1992, and took a match total of 10/74 on debut against Himachal Pradesh, and scored 52 not out in an innings victory. He took 2/91 in the next match against Haryana, but could no longer play in the Under-16s because of his advancing age. He could not break into the Under-19s at Delhi, and played no further youth domestic matches for two years, before transferring to Railways and breaking into their Under-19 team.In five matches for his new team during  1994–95, he took 24 wickets at 14.58 including a haul of 5/28 against Vidarbha. He was rewarded for his performance with a selection into the Under-19 Central Zone team for the zonal one-day tournament, taking five wickets at 25.00 in four matches. He had little success with the bat, scoring 47 on one occasion during the season, but otherwise only aggregating nine runs in six innings.The following season in 1995–96, Murali had a more successful season for Railways Under-19s. He started with 5/73 and 5/55 against Madhya Pradesh and made it three five-wicket hauls in a row with 5/42 against Vidarbha. He took another five-wicket haul later in the season against Rajasthan and ended the competition with 38 wickets at 18.94 in seven matches. Railways made the final, where they faced Punjab. Murali was Railways' most effective bowler, taking 4/57 in Punjab's first innings of 310. He then made 14 not out as Railways ceded a first innings lead, which was enough to give Punjab the title as the match ended in a draw. Kartik took 3/138 in the second innings. After the final, newly crowned champions took on the Rest of India, and Kartik took 2/25 and 4/89 to help his team to a six-wicket victory. Kartik had a less successful time in the zonal one-dayers for Central, taking only one wicket in three matches. He also improved his batting marginally, scoring 57 and three other double-digit scores.As a result of his performances during the season, Kartik was called up to the Indian Under-19 team for an international series against South Africa. In the youth Test, he took 4/40 as India dismissed South Africa for 159 to take a 19-run lead. In the second innings, he took 3/30 as South Africa fell for 107 in pursuit of 277. In two youth one-day internationals that followed, Kartik was prominent in the Indian victories, taking 3/23 and 3/33 respectively.


== Domestic career ==
The following season, 1996–97, Kartik was promoted into the senior ranks. In his first match, a List A fixture against Madhya Pradesh, Kartik took 2/27 from ten overs but was unable to prevent a four-wicket loss. He made his first-class debut the next day against the same team and bowled 16 overs taking a total of 1/18 in a drawn match. In a closely contested match, Madhya Pradesh were 8/89, and 17 runs short with two wickets in hand when time ran out. Kartik had scored a rearguard 47 in the second innings, without which Madhya Pradesh would have won.
In his next first-class match, against Vidarbha, he took a hat-trick in the first innings, ending with 6/28, helping to bowl Vidarbha out for 130. He then took 3/27 in the second innings as Vidarbha made only 95 to cede victory to Railways. He ended the season with 16 wickets at 19.37, and 185 runs at 20.55 including a 74 against Bengal, but was overlooked for the Central Zone selection for the Duleep Trophy after taking only six wickets in his last four matches for the season. In four one-day matches for Railways, Kartik took seven wickets at 12.42, including a match-winning 4/13 against Rajasthan.The following season he managed 14 wickets at 18.42 in four matches, but was dropped in the later stages of the tournament. After taking a match total of 7/74 in helping to orchestrate an innings victory over Rajasthan in his third match of the season,  Kartik went wicketless in the next match against Madhya Pradesh, and was dropped. He scored 70 runs at 23.33 during the tournament. In four one-dayers for Railways, he took four wickets at 29.75 at an economy rate of 3.30. Despite being dropped by Railways, Kartik was called up to make his senior debut for Central Zone. He took two wickets at 63.00 in two first-class matches, and then took three wickets at 43.00 at an economy rate of 4.30 in three matches.Despite the modest returns during the season, Kartik was selected for an India A tour of Pakistan in February and March 1998. In four first-class matches, which were persistently curtailed by the weather, Kartik bowled only 31 overs, and only two in the two matches against Pakistan A. He finished with four wickets at 27.50. In the two one-dayers, he proved expensive, taking 1/53 and 0/73 from ten overs each, as Pakistan won both matches easily.At the start of the 1998–99 season, Kartik took 23 wickets for Vijay Cricket Club in the Chennai League. He played more regularly in the 1998–99 Ranji Trophy, taking 29 wickets in seven matches at 19.3 to be the 13th highest wicket-taker. This included a 3/8 and 4/62 in an innings win over Rajasthan, and 5/84 and 5/55 in the last two matches of the campaign against Tamil Nadu and Delhi. He also added 29 and 53 with the bat against Tamil Nadu to help stave off a defeat after they were trailing by over 200 on the first innings.He was rewarded with selection for Central Zone and after taking 4/133 against North Zone, claimed 5/73 and 2/22 in the final to help them defeat West Zone by 112 runs in Aurangabad to claim the Duleep Trophy, and was the leading wicket-taker during the tournament. He scored a total of 183 runs at 18.30 for the entire Indian first-class season. He took five wickets at 26.60 in four zonal one-dayers, winning all four matches. 


== International career ==


=== Early international career ===
Kartik had a truncated but productive 1999–2000 Indian season. After taking a solitary wicket in a truncated match for India A against the touring New Zealand,  Kartik snared 6/62 and 6/31 against Vidarbha, He then went on an India A tour to the West Indies, so his only other first-class match was a Ranji Trophy encounter against Rajasthan in which he took 4/53. In four first-class matches in the Caribbean, Kartik took 18 wickets at 16.38. This included two matches against West Indies A, in which he took 6/75 before claiming 3/64 and 5/73 in the second match, although he was unable to force a victory in either. In two one-day matches against West Indies, Kartik took two wickets at 26.00 at an economy rate of 3.46. Returning to India, he took 12 wickets at 13.08 in five matches for Railways and the Indian Board president's XI, before playing in the zonal one-dayers with less success, managing only two wickets at 91.50 at an economy rate of 4.57. Despite these struggles, he was selected for the India A team for the Challenger Trophy, where he took four wickets at 38.00 at an expensive economy rate of 5.84.Despite the downturn in his limited overs fortunes towards the end of the season, Kartik's form was enough to earn him selection in the Indian Board president's XI for the tour match against the visiting South Africans before the Tests. He had a match total of 2/122, which was enough for him to secure national selection, playing in both Tests against South Africa in early 2000 at Mumbai and Bangalore as India sought a second spinner to accompany Anil Kumble, after Harbhajan Singh's performance in the role the previous season had been deemed inadequate. Kartik scored 14 before being bowled by Shaun Pollock as India batted first and made 225. He then took 2/28 from 18 overs as India restricted the tourists to 176, before collapsing to be all out for 113 in the second innings. Kartik scored only two runs before being caught behind by Pollock. Kartik took 1/50 in the second innings as South Africa ground their way to the target of 163 with four wickets in hand. In the second Test, Kartik took 3/123 and scored a duck and two as India were crushed by an innings. Overall, Kartik performed steadily, taking six wickets at 33.50.Kartik was selected in 2000 for the first intake of the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore, after earlier having made his Test debut in early 2000 in a home series against South Africa. However, his stay was cut short along with that of Harbhajan, when they were expelled by the director Hanumant Singh over disciplinary issues.In the 2000–01 season, Kartik started in fine form as he set out to maintain a Test position. In the Irani Trophy, the traditional season opener between the reigning Ranji champions—Mumbai—and the Rest of India, Kartik orchestrated the defeat of the title-holders. After taking 4/73 in Mumbai's 260, Kartik scored 22 in Rest of India's total of 389. He then took 9/70 to cut down Mumbai for 184, and his batting colleagues accumulated the 55 needed for victory without loss. Kartik then took 3/82 and 1/45 against Madhya Pradesh to secure his spot in the Test team.Kartik then played in one Test against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe respectively in India, taking match totals of 1/42 and 2/66. He scored 43 in the nine-wicket win over Bangladesh but did not bat in the seven-wicket win over Zimbabwe. New captain Sourav Ganguly—who had taken over after Sachin Tendulkar resigned following the South African whitewash—did not show much confidence in him, only giving him short but frequent spells. Kartik was dropped from the team after the first Test against Zimbabwe. In the one-day domestic circuit,  Kartik took nine wickets at 25.22 at an economy rate of 4.02, giving himself a chance for a Test recall in the Duleep Trophy.In the Duleep Trophy, Kartik struggled, taking 2/129 against East and then 0/178 in the first innings as North Zone accumulated 8/690 declared. He then had to endure the humiliation of not being trusted to bowl in the second innings as North reached 8/233. In the last match against South, Kartik could only aggregate 1/87. Although Kartik had scored 45 and 27 in his two innings, he totalled only three Duleep Trophy wickets at an average of 131.33. The selectors were unsatisfied by these performances, and despite a shoulder injury to Kumble, Kartik was overlooked as India hosted Australia in the 2001 Border Gavaskar Trophy. Harbhajan was recalled and took 32 wickets at 17 to engineer an Indian series win and permanently establish himself as India's leading spinner alongside Kumble. Kartik played in one more match for Railways at the end of the season, and his poor season continued, managing only a total of 2/152, although he did score 79 with the bat.Kartik started the new 2001–02 season well, taking 20 wickets at 15.40 in the first four first-class matches of the season, including five-wicket hauls against Rajasthan and Vidarbha, and 3/84 against the touring English Test team for a Board president's XI, but this was not enough for the selectors to recall him for Tests. He continued his form for Railways in the one-dayers, taking seven wickets at 20.57 in four matches at an economy rate of 4.00, before suffering a serious back injury that forced him to travel to Adelaide for treatment, which was funded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India. He made a successful comeback in January after a month-long layoff, and ended as fourth-highest wicket taker in the Ranji Trophy, with 34 at an average of 17, taking 5/51 and 3/7, and scoring 69 in his final match of the season to secure a win over Baroda. He batted well in the second half of the season,  scoring 42 and 58. He also performed well in the Challenger Trophy and zonal one-dayers after his surgery, taking ten wickets at 21.70 in seven matches. At the end of the season, Kartik was rewarded with his debut in One Day Internationals (ODIs); where he conceded 47 runs without a wicket from eight overs against the Zimbabwean batsmen, however India won by five wickets.


=== Support role ===
Since then, Kartik was India's third choice Test spinner behind Kumble and Harbhajan for most of the decade, only playing when they were injured or when India selected three spinners. At the end of the 2001–02 season, Kartik was selected for an India A tour of South Africa. He struggled in the first two matches, before taking 6/101 and scoring 59 in the second match against South Africa A to end the three games with ten wickets at 32.50. He had more success in the one-dayers, taking four wickets at 17.50 at an economy rate of 2.50 in three matches.The West Indies toured India at the start of the 2002–03 season and Kartik had a chance to press his claims for Test selection in two tour matches against the visitors. However, he had little impact, taking 2/92 for the Board president's XI and 0/117 for Railways against the Caribbean tourists, although he scored 72 with the bat in the latter match. He then took a total of 2/135 as Railways, the reigning Ranji Trophy holders, defeated the Rest of India in the Irani Trophy. With these lean returns, Kartik was overlooked for the Tests.Kartik had opportunities in the ODI format following his strong form in domestic limited overs matches, playing in four consecutive matches against the West Indies. After going wicketless in the first of these matches, he broke through in the next match to take his maiden ODI wicket in his third appearance. Kartik then took 3/36 in the next match as India scraped home by three wickets, but in his fourth outing of the series, he conceded 69 runs in nine overs without a wicket, after which he was dropped. He had taken four wickets at 47.25, at an economy rate of 4.84.Kartik was called into the Test squad to tour New Zealand in late 2002 after Kumble withdrew, but in the warm-up match he bowled one only over, in which he was hammered for 23 runs. He then watched from the sidelines as India only fielded one spin bowler—Harbhajan—in the Tests, held on green, pace-friendly surfaces. Kartik returned to India and was ineffective in the zonal one-dayers, taking a total of 1/148 from 24 overs in three matches, conceding more than a run a ball. Combined with his results against the West Indies, the poor returns saw him left out of the 2003 Cricket World Cup squad, with Harbhajan and Kumble preferred.
While the World Cup was in progress, Kartik toured the West Indies with India A, playing against the domestic teams in five first-class matches. He took 14 wickets at 30.50 including a 5/105 against Barbados and 4/57 against Trinidad and Tobago. India A then toured England during the northern hemisphere summer and Kartik took 10 wickets at 40.00 and scored 79 runs at 26.33 including a 50 in four first-class matches, and three wickets at 44.33 in one-dayers.At the start of the 2003–04 season, Kartik took 2/118 and 2/41 for India A in a match against the touring New Zealanders, and was overlooked for the Test series against the visitors. He managed only a total of 1/84 from 18 overs in the Challenger Trophy but was called into the ODI team and gained semi-regular appearances during the TVS Trophy against New Zealand and Australia, competing with Kumble and Harbhajan for a regular position in the team. In four matches during the competition, he was economical although not very penetrative, taking four wickets at 38.25 at an economy rate of 3.82.


=== Occasional international appearances in 2004 and 2005 ===
After taking match figures of 6/117 and 5/140 for India A against Sri Lanka A, Kartik made his first overseas appearance for India, replacing the injured Harbhajan midway through the 2003–04 tour of Australia. He had little success in his first tour match, taking 1/64 and 1/53 against Australia A. He played in the final Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground when India fielded two spinners for the only time in the series. He was punished by the Australian batsmen, taking a total of 1/211 from 45 overs, a run rate of 4.68 in a high-scoring draw.Kartik then made sporadic appearances in the VB triangular ODI series, playing in four of India's ten matches, as he and Kumble were brought in and out of the team in an attempt to challenge the Australian superiority. He continued to be punished by the Australian batsmen, taking a total of 1/178 from 26 overs, an economy rate of 6.84. However, he did manage to resist the Australians with the bat; in his only two innings he made 32 not out and 23 as the Indian batting was dismissed for only 203 and 151 respectively.Despite these performances, Kartik was retained for the ODI tour of Pakistan with Harbhajan still injured, taking five wickets at 32.80 at an economy of 5.46. He played in three of the five matches and India won all of these. Kartik was also in the Test squad, but did not play a match as India opted to field only Kumble and won the series 2–1.Kartik started the 2004–05 season by scoring 56 and 16 and taking 2/42 and 2/49 as Rest of India defeated Mumbai in the Irani Trophy, but it was not enough to prevent Harbhajan from resuming his position in the team for the home Test series against Australia. He got an opportunity in the Third Test in Nagpur, when Harbhajan was ill, taking 3/57 and 2/74 as India lost by 342 runs to lose their first home series to Australia since 1969–70. Kartik held his place when Harbhajan returned for the final Test in Mumbai as India fielded three spinners, and took 4/44 and 3/32 in a man of the match performance which saw India win by 13 runs. Both of these performances occurred under the captaincy of Rahul Dravid with Ganguly injured, in which Kartik netted his wickets at an average of 17.50 compared to 51.08 under Ganguly's leadership. Kartik played the last of his eight Tests in a subsequent opening match against South Africa in Kanpur, taking a total of 2/93 under Ganguly's command, only to be dropped after India chose to only use two spinners in the subsequent matches. Kartik spent the next month watching from the sidelines as the reserve slow bowler, as only Kumble and Harbhajan played during the tour of Bangladesh. During this campaign, he played the second ODI, taking 2/43 as India lost to Bangladesh for the first time. Kartik returned to India and took seven wickets at 35.42 at an economy rate of 4.69 in the zonal one-dayers and Challenger Trophy, and then played four first-class matches to end the season, taking 10 wickets at 19.10. At the end of the season, he took 2/54 in a home ODI against Pakistan, who scored 7/319 to overhaul the target.He enjoyed more opportunities in the ODI arena in 2005, when Kumble was dropped by newly appointed coach Greg Chappell due to his lack of athleticism, as well as the introduction of the experimental rules which allowed the use of one substitute, thus opening an extra position in the team. Kartik had a modest start under the new regime, taking 1/52 from nine overs in a win over a depleted host Zimbabwe team. He returned to India and started the new season in fine all-round form. After taking 2/34 in the first innings, he scored his highest first-class score of 96 to guide Railways to 311, giving them a first-innings lead of 88 runs over  Rest of India in the Irani Trophy. He then took 3/28 to dismiss Rest of India for 137 in their second innings, setting up a nine-wicket win. He then took seven wickets at 16.85 at an economy rate of 4.56 in three matches for India Seniors in the Challenger Trophy, including a match-winning 5/29 in the final against India B.Kartik was thus selected in the Indian ODI team for the home summer, and played in ten of the twelve ODIs that India hosted in late 2005. He started well with 3/48 in a 152-run crushing of Sri Lanka in Nagpur, and went on to finish the series with eight wickets at 30.25, playing in six of the seven matches. However, his form dissipated and he went wicketless in the South African series, conceding 126 runs in 28 overs, and giving away more than a run a ball in the last two matches. Kumble remained in favour for the Tests along with Harbhajan, and Kartik returned to Ranji competition while they bowled against Sri Lanka in the five-dayers. Kartik took 5/95 against Mumbai and then 8/40 against Delhi, and in three Ranji Trophy matches took 17 wickets at 19.94.Despite his ineffectiveness against South Africa, Kartik was retained in the ODI squad, but after conceding 64 runs from nine overs in the first ODI loss against Pakistan, he was replaced in early-2006 in the Test and ODI squad by 17-year-old leg-spinner Piyush Chawla and off-spinner Ramesh Powar respectively.


=== County career ===
In late 2006, India's ODI team began to hit rocky waters. After losing a bilateral series in the West Indies due to his poor performance, they were knocked out of a triangular tournament in Malaysia ahead of the finals, and were eliminated in the first round of the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy on home soil. Kartik took four wickets at 34.00 and an economy rate of 5.36 in the Challenger Trophy and could not earn a recall. He had a steady domestic first-class season, taking 26 wickets at 25.53 in nine matches, never taking more than five wickets in a match. He took 13 wickets at 27.92 in eight one-day matches for the season, and was overlooked as Kumble and Harbhajan were the spinners selected for the 2007 Cricket World Cup. India were knocked out in the first round after losing to Bangladesh, and Harbhajan was dropped while Kumble retired from ODIs, but Kartik did not do enough to persuade the selectors to hand him a recall.
In 2004, Kartik played in the Lancashire League with Ramsbottom as their professional. In 19 games, he took 80 wickets at 9.92 and scored 464 runs at 25.77. He scored three fifties with a best of 83 against Colne and took nine five-wicket innings hauls including a best of 9/30 against Enfield in addition to two other matches in which he took seven wickets.In 2005, he returned to Ramsbottom as their professional for a second season, with more effect. He took 83 wickets at 9.19 and scored 519 runs at 37.07 in 20 matches. He scored five fifties including a best of 66, and took eight five-wicket innings hauls including a best of 9/47 against Church as well as 7/27 against Lowerhouse. These performances earned him notice, and in late 2005, he appeared as a late-season overseas player substitute for Lancashire, and became the first overseas Lancashire player to take ten wickets on their debut, with 10/168 against Essex. This 5/93 and 5/75 helped Lancashire to an eight-wicket win, and in his only other first-class match, he took 4/43 and 2/4, which was not enough as the Roses went down to Leicestershire by four runs. His sixteen wickets at 16.25 placed him second on the season's bowling averages, and helped the team to be promoted from Second Division. In two one-day games, Kartik took five wickets at 13.40.Despite these performances, he was not initially offered a contract for 2006. Eventually in August 2006, he was again signed as a late-season overseas player for Lancashire just in time to appear in the C&G Trophy final against Sussex, taking 2/28 and scoring a duck in a 15-run defeat. He took eight wickets at 17.25 in four one-dayers, and six wickets at 39.00 in three first-class matches with a best of 3/89, as well a 40 with the bat against Hampshire.In 2007, he joined Middlesex as an overseas registration. He made his debut as the county club's 700th first-class cricketer against Somerset at Taunton in April 2007. He took 51 wickets at 24.96 in 12 matches and agreed to sign on for a further season in 2008. A highlight of Kartik's stint was a haul of 6/21 and 3/52 that helped set up an innings win over Glamorgan, and 6/85 and 3/83 that secured a 38-run win over Leicestershire. A third five-wicket haul, 5/38 against Derbyshire, was not enough to prevent a 15-run defeat. With the bat, Kartik contributed 209 runs at 19.00 with a best of 35. Kartik was also prolific for his new county in the one-dayers, taking 21 wickets at 23.52 in 15 matches, taking three wickets in a match twice, both of which resulted in wins. During the T20 tournament, Kartik took nine wickets at 10.77 and an economy rate of 5.70, including a haul of 5/13 in a vain attempt to halt an Essex run-chase.


=== Brief international return and later career ===
In late 2007, Kartik was recalled to the ODI team in place of the struggling Powar midway through the series against Australia. He played his first ODI in 18 months when he returned for the fourth match at Mohali. He took 1/48, and conceded only two runs in the 48th over as Australia stumbled in a tight run chase to give India their first win of the series.Kartik took only one wicket in the next two matches, which Australia won. In the seventh and final match, Kartik took a career best of 6/27 from 10 overs at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai to bowl Australia out for 193. The tourists had reached 2/117 after 19.4 overs, scoring at over six runs and over before Kartik removed Brad Hodge and Andrew Symonds from consecutive balls. He failed to get his hat-trick, but in the 32nd over he removed Brad Haddin from the first ball, and then Brad Hogg and Brett Lee from the fourth and fifth balls. Again Kartik missed the hat-trick opportunity, but returned to claim his six wicket. In reply, India had fallen to 8/143 before Kartik chipped in with an unbeaten 21 from 34 balls in an unbroken 52-run stand with Zaheer Khan, guiding India to a two-wicket victory. Kartik was recognised as the man of the match. Kartik then made his T20 international debut, taking 0/27 from four overs in an Indian win over Australia.In the following series against Pakistan, Kartik was only selected in the first, third and fifth matches, and took two wickets at an average of 68.00 at an economy rate of 5.23. As a result, Kartik was omitted from the ODI tour of Australia in favour of Chawla.Due to his international commitments, Kartik made only sporadic appearances during the Indian domestic scene in 2007–08. He took nine wickets at 44.22 and scored 77 runs at 19.25 in three first-class fixtures. After being dropped from India's limited-overs team, Kartik continued his strong one-day form at domestic level, taking six wickets at 25.33 at an economy rate of only 3.16 in six matches.Kartik was purchased by the Kolkata Knight Riders in the inaugural 2008 Indian Premier League. He played in six matches, taking three wickets at 42.33, but was dropped because his economy rate was beyond eight runs an over. All of these came in one match in which he took 3/17.
Kartik was part of the Middlesex team that won the 2008 Twenty20 Cup in England, their first domestic title for 15 years. He played in 11 matches and took 14 wickets at 20.14 at an economy rate of 6.71, claiming at least one wicket in all but one of the matches. Kartik represented Middlesex in the Stanford competition in October, taking two wickets at 25.50 at an economy rate of 6.37.His second first-class season with Middlesex was much less successful than the first; Kartik took only 16 wickets at 34.06 in seven matches, with a best of 4/101 against Derbyshire. He scored 161 runs at 20.12 with a best of 44 against Warwickshire. His one-day form was also lean, yielding six wickets at 33.00 in six matches.Kartik returned to India and took 16 wickets at 32.75 in six matches for Railways in the Ranji Trophy. After taking 5/85 in the first innings of the season opener against Karnataka, his performances fell away and he managed only four wickets in his last three matches. Nevertheless, he was selected for Central Zone in the Duleep Trophy and took a total of 2/98 as they lost on first innings to South and were eliminated after one match. Kartik made his contribution with the bat, scoring 197 runs at 24.62 for the season, including a score of 56 against Maharashtra and two other efforts of 30. Playing for both Railways and Central, Kartik took 12 wickets at 23.50 in the one-day matches for the season. He also scored 65 runs at 13.00.During the 2009 IPL season, which was held in South Africa, Kartik played in ten matches and took four wickets at 50.25, but he was one of the most economical bowlers, conceding only 5.91 runs per over. Kolkata were wracked by infighting and came last. Kartik also scored 21 runs not out. In the 2009 English season, Kartik resumed service for Middlesex, and as in the IPL he was most effective as a stock bowler, taking only four wickets at 51.50 in eight T20 fixtures at an economy rate of 6.86, never taking multiple wickets in a match. Middlesex, who had won the domestic title the previous year, only tasted victory in two of the Twenty20 matches that Kartik played in.Kartik played in ten first-class matches for Middlesex, taking 33 wickets at 22.87. He took his season's innings best of 5/65 and then 2/26 in the season opener against cross-London rivals Surrey, and then took 3/32 and 4/53 in a hard-fought 47-run win over Kent, and a total of 6/139 in the next match against Essex, but his season fell away at the end, managing only six wickets in the last three matches. With the bat, he made 336 runs at 24.00, the most prolific season of his career with the willow, including 62 against Essex and 57 not out against Gloucestershire. He played in a solitary one-dayer, taking 2/19 against Northamptonshire.At the end of the 2009 season, it was announced that Kartik would join Somerset as their overseas player for the 2010 season.During the 2009–10 Indian season, Kartik played in seven matches for Railways in the Ranji Trophy, taking 17 wickets at 25.05 including a best of 5/81 against Mumbai. He also scored 44 against the team and ended with 97 runs at 12.12 for the season. However his figures were not enough to gain selection for Central Zone in the Duleep Trophy.
As of 2020, he is currently a cricket commentator, working on Star Sports coverage of India home games and the Indian Premier League.

Kindenheim,"Kindenheim is an Ortsgemeinde – a municipality belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality – in the Bad Dürkheim district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.


== Geography ==


=== Location ===
The municipality lies in the northwest of the Rhine-Neckar urban agglomeration and is a winegrowing centre in the Palatinate near the north end of the German Wine Route. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Leiningerland, whose seat is in Grünstadt, although that town is itself not in the Verbandsgemeinde.


== History ==
In 817, Kindenheim had its first documentary mention as Cunerono. Later it was called Cunnenheim or Kinnenheim. Until 1969 it belonged to the now abolished Frankenthal district, and in 1972 it was assigned to the newly formed Verbandsgemeinde of Grünstadt-Land


=== Religion ===
In 2007, 59.8% of the inhabitants were Evangelical and 12.5% Catholic. The rest belonged to other faiths or adhered to none.


== Politics ==


=== Municipal council ===
The council is made up of 16 council members, who were elected at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.
The municipal election held on 7 June 2009 yielded the following results:


=== Coat of arms ===
The German blazon reads: In Silber auf grünem Grund zwei unbekleidete naturfarbene Kinder, von denen das rechte in der Rechten geschultert eine goldene Hacke, das linke in der Linken ein goldenes Rebmesser (Sesel) hält, während beide mit der anderen Hand zwischen sich eine aufrecht stehende grüne Traube halten.
The municipality’s arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Argent on a mount vert two naked children proper crined Or, the one in dexter holding in his dexter hand a two-pronged hoe resting on his shoulder of the third, the one in sinister holding in his sinister hand a billhook of the third, both supporting with their free hands a bunch of grapes palewise reversed with leaves of the second.
The arms were approved by the Mainz Ministry of the Interior in 1967 and go back to a court seal from 1544, albeit in modified form. The two children are canting for the municipality’s name, Kind being the German word for “child” and Kinder the word for “children”.


== Culture and sightseeing ==


=== Buildings ===
The Kreutzenberger winery can be considered a monument in building form. The Bauhaus architect Otto Prott built the house in the economically hardship-stricken 1920s in the style of Modernity. In 2005, the house was carefully expanded in the style of those times with the addition of a winepress house with a wine tasting parlour on the rooftop terrace. The architect Heribert Hamann earned the Architekturpreis Wein for this.


=== Families of Kindenheim ===
There are a number of families whose history spans nearly 500 years in Kindenheim.  They include:
Keller - The Keller Family trace their descent from Martin and Anne Keller, and their children - Hanns Keller (b. 1605, Kindenheim) and his sister Appolonnia Keller (b. c. 1614).  Today Kellergasse commemorates the family.
Seyb - Deobaldt Seyb (born c. 1610) arrived in Kindenheim during the time of the Thirty Years War. It is said that he originated from the Palatine, and served as an officer in the army. Deobaldt Seyb married Appolonnia Keller (b. c. 1614 - 1658), of Kindenheim, in 1630. He died before 1652, and was buried in Kindenheim. The Seyb family traces their descent from their three surviving children - Hans Caspar Seyb, Johannes Seyb and Anna Katherina Seyb
Gudex - The Gudex Family are said to have arrived in Kindenheim, via Morstadt,  from France, following the Edict of Fontainebleau, in 1685.

Nguyễn Huệ Boulevard,"Nguyễn Huệ Boulevard (Vietnamese: Đường Nguyễn Huệ) is a boulevard in District 1, downtown Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Being one of Saigon's oldest thoroughfares, the boulevard had undergone several transformations; it is currently a famous pedestrian street in the city.The boulevard stretches from Lê Thánh Tôn Street, right across from Ho Chi Minh City Hall, to Tôn Đức Thắng Boulevard (Bạch Đằng Quay, Saigon River waterfront).


== History ==
The boulevard was originally a canal known as Kinh Lớn (Grand Canal), which linked the former Citadel of Saigon (the Thành Quy) to Saigon River. In the first two decades after the French conquest of Saigon, the canal remained an important waterway, as the central market was then located on its bank. The two quayside streets along the canal were designated by n° 18, before they were officially named Quai Charner (on the right bank) and Quai Rigault de Genouilly (on the left bank) in 1865. Due to the pestilential odors emanating from the canal, local residents had soon requested that it be filled in. However, it took eighteen years of discussions for this to be achieved in 1886–1887. The resulting wide thoroughfare was henceforth named boulevard Charner.
From 1926, the boulevard had two wide central avenues separated by a thin strip of grass, which was ordered by the former Saigon mayor Rouelle. In 1955, it was renamed Nguyễn Huệ Boulevard by the South Vietnamese government.


=== Nguyen Hue pedestrian street ===

In October 2014, the government of Ho Chi Minh City decided to convert the middle lanes of the boulevard into a pedestrian square. The project was completed on April 29, 2015. During weekend evenings, the entire boulevard is pedestrianized.


== Buildings ==
(South east to North west, numerical order)


== Public transportation ==


=== Buses ===
Being a tourist street, tourist buses are commonly seen on the Nguyễn Huệ Boulevard.


=== Metro ===
A metro line is being built. The Line 1, Ho Chi Minh City Metro would cross beneath Nguyễn Huệ Boulevard. The nearest station, the Opera House metro station has many exits to the boulevard.


== Nguyen Hue Flower Street ==
Nguyen Hue Flower Street, or natively known as Đường hoa Nguyễn Huệ, is the common name of Nguyễn Huệ Boulevard during the lunar new year festival. During the festival, the street is decorated for the occasion and are exclusively for pedestrians. The tradition started in 2004, which previously known as Flower Market Nguyễn Huệ.
During the 20th century, the street is commonly a marketplace for trading flowers during the end of the lunar years. Vendors would come from the port at Bạch Đằng Quay. As such, during these years, the street is a common attraction for citizens to sightseeing and enjoy the Tết atmosphere.
After 2003, the city relocated the flower market to 23 Tháng 9 park. In 2004, the city started the tradition to setup flowers decoration on the street, designated as a sightseeing area during new year times. Since then, the name Nguyen Hue flower street is born. The street during this time is for pedestrians, and transportations are forbidden on the street.
In February 2015, the boulevard was under construction, so the Flower Street event was held on the nearby Hàm Nghi Boulevard. Following the boulevard's conversion into a pedestrian street, the tradition continues, with flowers decorated during the new year time. Motorbike routes continued to be blocked, but this time with additional nearby streets like Lê Lợi. During Tet 2023, in addition to the Flower Street, a book street event was held on Lê Lợi Boulevard.
The Nguyễn Huệ flower street are considered to be a culture and tourist event during the new year time, attract many citizens, tourists, as well as home-coming overseas Vietnamese.

Exponential-Golomb coding,"An exponential-Golomb code (or just Exp-Golomb code)  is a type of universal code.  To encode any nonnegative integer x using the exp-Golomb code:

Write down x+1 in binary
Count the bits written, subtract one, and write that number of starting zero bits preceding the previous bit string.The first few values of the code are:

 0 ⇒ 1 ⇒ 1
 1 ⇒ 10 ⇒ 010
 2 ⇒ 11 ⇒ 011
 3 ⇒ 100 ⇒ 00100
 4 ⇒ 101 ⇒ 00101
 5 ⇒ 110 ⇒ 00110
 6 ⇒ 111 ⇒ 00111
 7 ⇒ 1000 ⇒ 0001000
 8 ⇒ 1001 ⇒ 0001001
...
In the above examples, consider the case 3. For 3,  x+1 = 3 + 1 = 4. 4 in binary is '100'. '100' has 3 bits, and 3-1 = 2. Hence add 2 zeros before '100', which is '00100'
Similarly, consider 8. '8 + 1' in binary is '1001'.  '1001' has 4 bits, and 4-1 is 3. Hence add 3 zeros before 1001, which is '0001001'. 
This is identical to the Elias gamma code of x+1, allowing it to encode 0.


== Extension to negative numbers ==
Exp-Golomb coding is used in the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC and H.265 High Efficiency Video Coding video compression standards, in which there is also a variation for the coding of signed numbers by assigning the value 0 to the binary codeword '0' and assigning subsequent codewords to input values of increasing magnitude (and alternating sign, if the field can contain a negative number):

 0 ⇒ 0 ⇒ 1 ⇒ 1
 1 ⇒ 1 ⇒ 10 ⇒ 010
−1 ⇒ 2 ⇒ 11 ⇒ 011
 2 ⇒ 3 ⇒ 100 ⇒ 00100
−2 ⇒ 4 ⇒ 101 ⇒ 00101
 3 ⇒ 5 ⇒ 110 ⇒ 00110
−3 ⇒ 6 ⇒ 111 ⇒ 00111
 4 ⇒ 7 ⇒ 1000 ⇒ 0001000
−4 ⇒ 8 ⇒ 1001 ⇒ 0001001
...
In other words, a non-positive integer x≤0 is mapped to an even integer −2x, while a positive integer x>0 is mapped to an odd integer 2x−1.
Exp-Golomb coding is also used in the Dirac video codec.


== Generalization to order k ==
To encode larger numbers in fewer bits (at the expense of using more bits to encode smaller numbers), this can be generalized using a nonnegative integer parameter  k.  To encode a nonnegative integer x in an order-k exp-Golomb code:

Encode ⌊x/2k⌋ using order-0 exp-Golomb code described above, then
Encode x mod 2k in binaryAn equivalent way of expressing this is:

Encode x+2k−1 using the order-0 exp-Golomb code (i.e. encode x+2k using the Elias gamma code), then
Delete k leading zero bits from the encoding result

Reticulamoeba,"Reticulamoeba is a genus of Rhizaria. It is a relatively large unicellular protist and is commonly known for its thin reticulopodia radiating outwards from the cell (Bass et al., 2012). Reticulamoeba are strictly benthic protists that use their reticulopodia for feeding. They have a close association with benthic diatoms as their main source of food (Bass et al., 2012). There are only two Reticulamoeba species described to date and the protozoologist Karl Grell discovered both of them (Bass et al., 2012).


== History ==
The genus Reticulamoeba was described in 1994 by the protozoologist Karl Grell based on the species R. gemmipara and not until a year later a second species R. minor was discovered (Bass et al., 2012). The two species form a clade within the cercozoan class Granofilosea (Bass et al., 2012). Within this clade, Reticulamoeba present phylogenetic similarities with the genus Mesofila (Bass et al., 2012).


== Habitat and ecology ==
Reticulamoeba is commonly isolated from benthic marine littoral zones as well as in freshwater biofilm (Bass et al., 2012). 


== Anatomy ==
The genus is an amoeboflagellate with a stationary flattened amoeboid stage (Bass et al., 2012). The body of Reticulamoeba is roundish with an irregular outline and about 3-8μm across (Bass et al., 2012). The cell consists of a nucleus, digestive vacuoles and thin reticulopodia (Grell, 1995). The long thin reticulopodia stretch outwards from the cell to form networks across a substrate (Bass et al., 2012). The network created can be larger in diameter than the cell itself (Bass et al., 2012). The reticulopodia present bidirectionally motile granules and move slowly enabling them to change the size and the shape of the network formed (Bass et al., 2012). The first described species of Reticulamoeba was found associated with diatoms on which they feed (Bass et al., 2012). The reticulopodia are what interacts with the diatoms during feeding by penetrating the diatom frustules (Bass et al., 2012). Unlike other organisms, Reticulamoeba form feeding communities to enhance their feeding method; Reticulamoeba cells work together fusing their reticulopodia with each other to create these ‘feeding communities’ (Bass et al., 2012). The genus also shows a biflagellate stage similar to the amoeboid stage, round to irregular in shape (Bass et al., 2012). They can be described as zoospores and have a short anterior and long posterior flagella that aid the Reticulamoeba in swimming (Bass et al., 2012). The flagella are used for both swimming and gliding and once they become stationary they resorb the flagella and eject their reticulopodia to return to the amoeboid stage (Bass et al., 2012). Species of Reticulamoeba differ in their method of cell division. The cells undergo cell division in one of two ways, either by binary fission or by unequal binary fission (Bass et al., 2012).

Mock Auctions Act 1961,"The Mock Auctions Act 1961 (9 & 10 Eliz. 2. c. 47) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that regulated mock auctions. It was repealed by the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/1277).


== Background ==
Attempts to pass an Act regulating mock auctions started in 1928, with the Mock Auctions Bill introduced by Lord Gorell. The Bill failed after it was passed to a Select Committee, which reported that existing provisions were sufficient to deal with the problem. Opponents of the Bill argued that it would be impossible to secure convictions, since victims are reluctant to come forward and highlight their gullibility. The second Mock Auctions Bill was introduced to Parliament by a group of MPs including Norman Dodds, and received royal assent on 27 July 1961.


== Act ==
To avoid interfering with genuine auctions, the Act includes a complex and detailed definition of a mock auction. A mock auction is an auction featuring competitive bidding which satisfies one of three tests:

if there is a reduction in price or repayment of the money to the highest bidder,
if the right to bid is restricted to people who have bought other items or
if any items are offered as gifts or given away.The punishment for running a mock auction, if convicted, was at most either a £1,000 fine, two years in prison or both.

Fools for Scandal,"Fools for Scandal is a 1938 screwball comedy film starring Carole Lombard and Fernand Gravet, featuring Ralph Bellamy, Allen Jenkins, Isabel Jeans, Marie Wilson and Marcia Ralston, and produced and directed by Mervyn LeRoy. It was written by Herbert Fields and Joseph Fields with additional dialogue by Irving Brecher, and uncredited contributions by others based on the unproduced 1936 play Return Engagement by Nancy Hamilton, James Shute and Rosemary Casey.  The songs are by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart.
Fools for Scandal is now best remembered as one of Lombard's worst films and one that set her on the course for seeking dramatic roles for the next few years.


== Plot ==
Film star Kay Winters (Carole Lombard) is traveling through Paris under a wig and the pseudonym of Kay Summers with her maid and companion Myrtle (Marie Wilson). She meets Rene (Fernand Gravet), a French marquis who has lost all his money and has pawned all his material possessions to live, something Paris society does not know. He sees her on the street in Montmartre and offers to give her a tour of the real Paris. Kay, who already had plans to attend dinner with Lady Paula Malverton (Isabel Jeans), tries to brush him off, only to become charmed by the persistent and impetuous Rene. Once finished with the tour, they have dinner, and unexpectedly run into Lady Malverton and her party. Lady Malverton calls Rene over to her table. When he returns, he discovers that Kay has left. However, she left a note asking him to lunch with her the following day.
Kay returns to her hotel, to see Phillip Chester (Ralph Bellamy) waiting for her, the man who is in love with her. The next day, Kay is waiting by the fountain and Rene discovers that he has overslept. His friend, Dewey Gilson (Allen Jenkins), has taken too long getting Rene's suit from the pawn shop. Rene waits, helplessly, as Kay prepares to leave. However, he runs down and obtains two carpets from a salesman, wrapping them around himself as a form of wealthy robe. He alerts Kay that he will be ready to have lunch in just a while, but two women, who believe that he is selling the carpets, demand to buy them. In an argument about who can buy the carpets between the women and Kay, the carpets are pulled from Rene and he runs away in his underwear.
Later, Rene discovers that Kay is actually a movie star. Before he can contact her, however, she leaves for London. Rene follows her. He comes to her house at a party in which Kay has ordered her guests to appear in animal masks. Upon seeing Rene, she invites him to dinner, where Lady Malverton tells him to demonstrate his skills as a chef. After tasting the food that Rene prepares, Kay, as a joke, offers him a job as her cook. Rene, delighted, accepts without Kay knowing. Meanwhile, Phillip begs Kay to marry him, but she again postpones her answer.
Lady Malverton finds Rene in the kitchen, where he tells her that he has taken the job of being Kay's chef. Lady Malverton spreads the gossip. The following morning, Kay is delivered breakfast by Rene and begs him to leave. Rene tells her he has no such intention and answers the phone several times and tells everyone he is Kay's chef. Lady Malverton arrives with a swarm of gossips and demands to know the truth. Kay tells them that she has hired him as a chef. Nonetheless, the tabloids are already running reports that Rene is Kay's ""love chef"".
Kay, undaunted, accepts Phillip's proposal of marriage and orders an engagement dinner. Rene does his best to spoil the dinner and succeeds, with Phillip walking out of the house after a quarrel with Kay. Rene finally gets Kay to admit she loves him, but she tells him that she will not marry him, as the difference in social status between them will earn her the derision of everyone she knows. Rene tells her that he is a French marquis and leaves, angered by her silly fears. Kay follows him into an opera house where they kiss before an unexpected audience.


== Cast ==

Cast notes:
Fools for Scandal featured a cameo by Lombard's Pekingese, and it was the third pairing of Lombard and Bellamy.


== Production ==
The working title of the film, which was planned to be filmed in Technicolor, was ""Food for Scandal""; both titles were inspired by Sheridan's play The School for Scandal. The day of its release, April 16, 1938, Sheridan's play was feature on NBC Blue's program Great Plays.The film was Lombard's first and last for Warner Bros., and Mervyn LeRoy's last; he then went to MGM.Fernand Gravet came to Warners after having achieved considerable success in French films under the name Fernand Gravey, but the failure of Fools for Scandal prevented him from achieving star status in the United States. He made one other film in the U.S., The Great Waltz for MGM, then returned to France.Warners borrowed Ted Tetzlaff, Lombard's favorite cinematographer, from Paramount Pictures for the film, so that Lombard would be comfortable with how she was shot.  She later said that she knew Fools for Scandal was a flop ""when my friends confined their comments to how beautifully I had been photographed"". Unfortunately, she never worked with Tetzlaff again.


== Reception ==
Fools for Scandal was an enormous box-office failure. Although Lombard considered The Gay Bride her worst film, many contemporary fans give Fools for Scandal that distinction. Lombard lacked chemistry with Gravet, and audiences, who had already begun tiring of screwball comedies, noted a similarity between the plots of Fools for Scandal and Lombard's previous screwball film My Man Godfrey.Fools's failure prompted Lombard to pursue only dramatic roles for the next few years until she joined Alfred Hitchcock and Robert Montgomery for 1941's Mr. & Mrs. Smith.

Tong lau,"Tong lau or ke lau are tenement buildings built from the late 19th century to the 1960s in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Southern China, and Southeast Asia. Designed for both residential and commercial uses, they are similar in style and function to the shophouses with five-foot way (Min Nan Chinese: têng-á-kha) of Southeast Asia. Over the years, tong lau construction has seen influences of Edwardian-style architecture and later the Bauhaus movement.


== Etymology ==
Tong lau (Cantonese) or tang lou (Mandarin) means ""Chinese building"" – Tong or Tang (唐) refers to the Tang dynasty and is used as a term to mean Chinese, and lau (樓) is a building with more than one floor. It is a general term for a type of building found in Hong Kong that also developed in Macau and Canton (Guangzhou) from traditional Southern Chinese townhouses.


== Architecture ==
Early tong lau buildings were generally long and narrow with a width of between 12 and 15 feet (3.7 and 4.6 m), determined by the length of the wooden beams. In Hong Kong's building regulations, tong lau refers to a building with any living space intended for more than one tenant. It is essentially a tenement building for residential and commercial use. The ground floor is reserved for commercial use, mostly by small businesses like retail shops and food vendors. The upper floors are for residential use, and cater to Chinese residents of Hong Kong. 
Most early tong lau were two-to-four stories tall, due to building regulations that initially limited the height of building to 1.25 times the width of the street with a maximum height of 35 feet (11 m). However, due to the influx of migrants from mainland China to Hong Kong in the 1950s, height control of buildings was relaxed in 1955, and some tong lau that were built after that might have nine or more floors and be built without lifts. The heyday of tong lau ended in the 1960s when population pressure resulted in many tong lau being demolished to make way for high-rise buildings, along with changes in building ordinances in order to allow for such high-rise buildings.Ke lau or qilou (Chinese: 騎樓. meaning ""riding building""), is a form of tong lau with an arcade running alongside the road for pedestrian use. The term was originally ""kelau with feet"" (Chinese: 有腳騎樓; pinyin: youjiao qilou; Jyutping: Jau5goek3 Ke4lau2), which was first used in Canton's building regulations in 1912, and referred to the columns forming the colonnade that supported the projecting floors that ""ride"" above. The ke lau buildings developed in Guangzhou were influenced by local traditions and the shophouses with five-foot ways of Singapore, which were first built following the instructions of Stamford Raffles given in his town plan soon after the founding of the colony in the early 19th century. Ke lau were built in Southern China (Guangdong, Guangxi and Fujian) starting in the early 20th century. Most of the ke lau in Guangzhou were built in the 1930s until the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war, and few were built after that period.


== History ==


=== Early tong lau ===
Early Hong Kongese tong lau mainly consisted of two- or three-story structures built back-to-back in areas such as Tai Ping Shan. 19th-century tong lau synthesized Chinese and European architectural features. While the Chinese component was based on building design from southern China, mainly that of Guangdong Province; European influences were usually Neoclassical. The tong lau roof used wood and/or Xieding tiles and iron was used for the balconies. The balcony's design was based on Cantonese styles. Windows used French styling and were made of wood and glass. The upper floors were supported by brick pillars and protruded out to the edge of the street.Inside, the floors were connected by wooden stairs. Most floors ranged from 450 to 700 square feet with very high ceilings. Top floors were often living quarters for shopkeepers and their family.
Other architectural features of early tong lau are:
granite capped balustrades
decorative urns on the roof
wooden floors and joists
Canton floor tilesIn 1903, in response to an outbreak of bubonic plague, the Hong Kong government issued a set of new regulations for tong lau so as to improve the living conditions for inhabitants in these buildings. New tong lau buildings needed to have a light well, have larger windows, and the buildings were limited to four floors so their residents can receive sufficient light. The frontage were set at 15 feet, and at the back there needed to be a six-foot lane, so as to remove back-to-back constructions. Roof tiles were also replaced by flat concrete roofs.In the 1920s, reinforced concrete began to be introduced as the main structural element, which allowed for a veranda as well as cantilevered or recessed balconies to let in extra light. An example of tong lau or ke lau from this period is Lui Seng Chun, a building in reinforced concrete built in Hong Kong in 1931.


=== After World War II ===
Tong lau built after World War II were simpler in design:
Iron balconies were replaced with concrete ones and later sealed with windows. Roofs were often flat with an open terrace and later renovated to allow for additional residential space. Wooden windows gave way to stainless steel windows. Air conditioning units were added to the windows in the 1970s and 1980s. Often clothes racks were added below the windows and hung above the sidewalk or street below. Signs were hung on the exterior walls and protruded onto the streets below.Other features of the new tong lau included:
mosaic floor tiles
terrazzo staircaseThe postwar boom and influx of immigrants led to a shortage of housing in Hong Kong. Many tong lau were renovated to become rental units. In order to become spacious space, each unit was separated from adjacent units through brick party walls, is between 13 and 16 feet wide (about 4 to 5 m).The ground floor of a tong lau was used as shop space, but a cockloft was often built on the upper space in front of the partition wall of the kitchen, or utilized as working area. Rooms on the upper floors were divided into smaller rooms and sublet as units by owners; said rooms were only big enough to accommodate bunk beds. The middle of the floor was a common space for tenants to eat and use. Bathrooms and kitchens were also shared among the tenants of each floor. Tenants paid for electricity and water on a monthly basis.The subletting of floors in tong lau led to changes in housing regulations in Hong Kong.
After the 1960s, many tong lau were demolished to give way to taller apartment and commercial buildings, especially new town or private apartment. Fewer Tong Lau are relatively found in Hong Kong today.On 29 January 2010, No. 45J Ma Tau Wai Road, Ma Tau Wai, a five-story-tall tong lau of more than 50 years history, suddenly collapsed at approximately 1:43 pm. Four people were killed. Such spontaneous, cascading and complete building collapse in Hong Kong has been quite rare since the Second World War and the incident raised concern of the HKSAR Government and the Hong Kong public towards the safety of the aging tong lau in Hong Kong, especially those built with similar specifications 50 or more years ago.


== Location ==


=== Mainland China ===
Ke lau styles varied from Chinese to European:
Gothic Style
Nanyang (Southeast Asia) Style
Ancient Roman Gallery Style
Imitation Baroque Style
Modernisme　
Traditional Chinese Architectural Style


==== Guangdong ====
Southern China, namely cities in Guangdong Province, is the birthplace of tong lau and ke lau. They were built by wealthy Chinese merchants in the cities like Guangzhou and, with the aid of overseas Chinese, in emigrant market towns like Chikan, Kaiping.Locations in Guangzhou with Ke lau:

Renmin Zhong Road (人民中路)
Renmin Nan Road (人民南路)
Shangxiajiu Pedestrian Street, including Dishifu Road (上下九步行街)
Yide Road especially area around the Sacred Heart Stone House Cathedral (一德路)
Wanfu Road (萬福路)
Taikang Road (泰康路)
Xinhua Bookstore of Science and Technology on Beijing Road (北京路)
Oi Kwan Hotel on Yanjiangxi Road (沿江西路)
186 Wenming Road (文明路)
139 Dezheng Nan Road (德政南路)


==== Hainan and Guangxi ====
As both Hainan Island and the eastern part of the Guangxi Province lie in the broader Cantonese sphere of linguistical and cultural influence and historically were part of Guangdong, several cities and towns also have this kind of architecture.


===== Beihai =====
The city of Beihai lies on the coast in Guangxi. The Old Sheng Ping Street (升平街舊址) is lined with 'ke lau architecture. Life and trade thrived here in the 19th century. Today it is full of restaurants, souvenir shops and adorned with sculptures and boards with information about local culture.


===== Haikou =====
The historical Bo'ai Road area is located in the heart of the Hainan capital city of Haikou. Nearly all the buildings here are of tong lau style. Beginning in 2012, the entire area has been undergoing restoration. It started with Zhongshan Road, now completed and converted into a pedestrian zone. The restoration is currently expanding outward with the facades being replastered and painted. Lights facing toward the facades to illuminate them at night are now installed on many of the buildings. With road repair ongoing, and new, tourist-related businesses replacing the old shops, the entire area is being developed as a visitor attraction.


===== Chengmai =====
The southern part of the town of Chengmai, located in Chengmai County, Hainan, has an area adjacent to the Nandu River that consists of numerous, dilapidated tong lau buildings.


===== Wenchang =====
The tong lau buildings in the city of Wenchang's ""Wennan Old Street"" have been completely restored. Unlike Haikou's Bo'ai Road area, the facades are unpainted and are gray in appearance. The area is located downtown and is a visitor attraction.


====== Puqian ======
An area within the town of Puqian, mostly consisting of a single street, is lined with tong lau buildings. This street is the main route from the port to the city center. However, the tong lau buildings here are in serious disrepair. In fact, many of them are structurally unsafe.

			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Macau ===
Tong lau are also found in Macau on Avenida de Almeida Ribeiro near the Largo do Senado. They are better preserved in Macau, where they did not give way to newer buildings. Upper floors no longer house people and often are assigned for commercial use. Tong lau here often feature Portuguese colonial architectural influences.


=== Hong Kong ===
The existence of tong lau was a culmination of a series of historic forces including the economic development of Hong Kong, the Second World War, and the influx of Chinese migrants to Hong Kong.In 1898, the government introduced a building and public health ordinance which defined all the buildings including tong lau. In 1903, the government introduced a four-story limit as well as a maximum height per story of 9 feet (2.7 m). This explains the general appearance of tong lau. The ordinance changed in 1962; this became fully operative in 1966, and no tong lau was built later.Tong laus are mainly distributed in the following areas in Hong Kong: Cheung Chau, Kennedy Town, Shek Tong Tsui, Sai Ying Pun, Sheung Wan, Central, Wan Chai, Causeway Bay, Happy Valley, Tai Hang, North Point, Quarry Bay, Sai Wan Ho, Shau Kei Wan, Chai Wan, Aberdeen, Tin Wan, Ap Lei Chau, Stanley, Tsim Sha Tsui, Yau Ma Tei, Mong Kok, Tai Kok Tsui, Sham Shui Po, Cheung Sha Wan, Shek Kip Mei, Hung Hom, To Kwa Wan, Ma Tau Wai, Ho Man Tin, Kowloon City, Wong Tai Sin, San Po Kong, Lok Fu, Tsz Wan Shan, Ngau Chi Wan, Kwun Tong, Ngau Tau Kok, Cha Kwo Ling, Kwai Chung, Tsuen Wan, Tuen Mun, Yuen Long, Tai Wai, Tai Po, Luen Wo Hui, Sheung Shui, Sha Tau Kok, Sai Kung Town, and Tai O.There are a number of extant tong lau in Hong Kong:

== Background ==
Robartes was the son of the Hon. Charles Bagenal Agar, youngest son of James Agar, 1st Viscount Clifden. His mother was Anna Maria Hunt, heiress of Lanhydrock, great-niece of Henry Robartes, 3rd Earl of Radnor and 4th Baron Robartes (which titles became extinct in 1757; see the Earl of Radnor 1679 creation for more information). He adopted the Robartes name by warrant in 1822 and inherited the Lanhydrock estate.
He commissioned the architect George Gilbert Scott to renovate Lanhydrock House but in 1881 it was badly damaged by a fire in which his wife died of smoke inhalation.


== Political career ==
Robartes was returned to Parliament for Cornwall East in 1847, a seat he held until 1868. In 1869 the barony of Robartes held by his mother's ancestors was revived when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Robartes, of Lanhydrock, and of Truro in the County of Cornwall.


== Family ==
Lord Robartes died at 1 Dean Street, Park Lane, London on 9 March 1882, aged 73. He had married in 1839 Juliana Pole-Carew (1812–1881) of Antony House and had one son Thomas Agar-Robartes, 6th Viscount Clifden, who succeeded him in the barony and to Lanhydrock. In 1899 Thomas also succeeded his second cousin as the sixth Viscount Clifden.

Boresch III of Ossegg and Riesenburg,"Boresch III of Ossegg and Riesenburg (died before 1312) was a Bohemian aristocrat of the House of Riesenburg.
The son of Boresch II (also Bohuslav II) was a member of the regional court (Landgericht) in 1291. At the end of the 13th century ore mining flourished on the Riesenburg estates. On 22 March 1302 he signed a treaty with the abbot of Ossegg, wherein he agreed to share the mining profits with Osek Abbey.
Following the death of King Wenceslaus II and the murder of his successor, Wenceslaus III one year later, a new wave of violence swept through Bohemia, as the powerful princes attempted to extend their estates and wealth during the interregnum. Church assets were seized, but attempts were also made to rectify the injustices of the past.
Boresch, too, could not resist further extending his power. In 1307 he was named as the owner of Sayda, this time however not as part of the Bohemian Empire but as an enfeoffment from the Margraviate of Meissen.
He was only mentioned once more before his death. In the treaty documents of 1312 his name no longer appears.

Kawa model,"The Kawa model is a culturally responsive conceptual framework used in occupational therapy to understand and guide the therapeutic process. Developed by Japanese occupational therapists, the model draws upon the metaphor of a river to describe human occupation and its relationship to well-being. The overarching goal of use is to ""provide a culturally flexible model to aid occupational therapists to improve communication with clients, to better understand what a client finds meaningful and important, and to design optimal client-centered interventions."": 17 In Japanese, kawa (かわ) means river, and the model uses the metaphor of a river to represent a person's life flow or occupational journey. The river represents the dynamic and ever-changing nature of life, while rocks, debris, and other elements in the river symbolize obstacles, challenges, and personal experiences. The model emphasizes that each person's river is unique and influenced by cultural, social, and personal factors.
The Kawa model incorporates five main elements: water, river banks and space, rocks, and driftwood. In the model, ""water (mizu) represents life flow and health, driftwood (ryuboku) represents personal assets and liabilities, rocks (iwa) represent life circumstances and problems, and the river walls (torimaki) represent physical and social environmental factors."": 1 


== History ==
Along with a team of Japanese occupational therapists, Dr. Michael Iwama first developed the Kawa model in 1999 alongside a team of Japanese occupational therapists (OTs). Dr. Iwama was looking to develop an occupational therapy model that could be easily understood by clients, not just practitioners and scholars. Dr. Iwama, coming from a Canadian background, imagined a model that utilized boxes and squares with arrows between them, but his Japanese colleagues envisioned the river, in part due to the popularity of the song ""Kawa no nagare no yō ni"" (""Like the Flow of the River"") by Hibari Misora, which depicted life as a river. Iwama's colleagues believed the metaphor of the river would resonate more deeply with their clients than Iwama's original idea because of their connection with nature, as well as their collectivistic perspective.The model is the first ""in occupational therapy (OT) practice that was developed from clinical practice outside of the Western English-speaking world through qualitative research."": 1  Because ""Eastern culture emphasizes the harmony between the person and environmental factors, which is believed to enhance health and well-being[,] ... the model focuses heavily on the client’s environmental contexts and how that impacts the flow of harmony in life, rather than mainly focusing on the individual client."": 1 In 2006, Iwama published The Kawa Model: Culturally Relevant Occupational Therapy, a textbook that provides an overview of the model. 
The model is now actively taught in over 500 OT programs and is utilized on six continents.: 1 


== Core concepts ==


=== Water ===
The concept of ""water"" represents an individual's life flow and priorities, including their cognition, emotion, physical impairments, occupations, roles, and life experiences. Generally speaking, water flows from a mountain, which would symbolize a person's birth and runs into an ocean or other large body of water, which would represent the person's death. Because ""water is fluid and ever changing,"": 373  it reflects the dynamic nature of occupation and the constant interaction between individuals and their environment. Iwama and other proponents of the model suggest that without water flowing and moving, life is stagnant.: 1  Further, water is impacted by the structural environment (e.g., rocks and riverbanks) much like an individual's "" life flow can be shaped, enhanced, or diminished"" by physical, social, and other environments.: 373  Beyond the water's ability to flow, OTs may ask clients to describe how the river is flowing, such as whether it is choppy or smooth.According to the model, if the river has a “strong, deep, unimpeded flow,”: 1129  the individual should experience optimal well-being.


=== River banks ===
The concept of ""river banks"" represents external factors that influence a person's life flow, including social and physical environments and contexts. These may include cultural norms, social expectations, family, and environmental conditions. These factors can support or hinder the person's occupational journey. However, in the best circumstances, ""these external elements would support and guide the client through difficult times just as the banks of the river support its flow."": 1 


=== Rocks ===
The concept of ""rocks"" represents obstacles, challenges, and life events that may disrupt or impact a person's occupational well-being. They can include physical or mental health conditions, personal difficulties, or environmental barriers.When visually depicting their life journey, individuals may consider the location and size of rocks, which would indicate when the event occurred, as well as the how the individual perceives it. If an individual perceives an event or challenge as being highly impactful and disruptive to their life, the rock would be larger, whereas a smaller rock may represent a more minute challenge.


=== Driftwood ===
The concept of ""driftwood"" represents personal traits and skills individuals can use to navigate their occupational journey. Driftwood can include personal traits (e.g., being optimistic or determined); personal skill sets and experiences (e.g., being trained in carpentry); specific beliefs, values and principles; and/or material/social capital (e.g., financial wealth or strong social networks).: 9 Importantly, driftwood can have either a positive or negative impact on the river's flow. Driftwood is intended to flow down the river, but sometimes it may become stuck on a rock and become an impediment; however, it may also unearth rocks to make them less challenging.


=== Spaces ===
The concept of ""spaces"" represents ""opportunities for expanding flow and well-being in accordance with the client’s perspective and priorities."": 1 Using the metaphor, the overarching goal of occupational therapy is to increase spaces for water to flow through the river. Occupational therapists (OTs) can then work with their clients to decrease the size of rocks, widen the river banks, and/or better utilize driftwood.: 10  For the former, clients may find ways to eliminate burdens in their life and/or develop strategies to overcome those barriers.: 10  To widen river banks, occupational therapists may work with clients to implement universal design methods into their daily lives and/or find other ways to alter the physical environment to make it less of a barrier.: 10  Lastly, OTs can work with clients to better utilize existing skill sets and attributes and/or develop new ones to help address barriers. Through these practices, the client's well-being should be positively impacted.: 10 


== Use ==
When utilizing the Kawa model, occupational therapists (OTs) often begin by requesting their clients create a visual representation of their life using the river metaphor described above. During and after the client's creation, the OT will ask ""open-ended, clarifying questions, using a collaborative approach to ensure that the model provides an accurate representation of the client’s perceptions of his or her life."": 17  The discussion should allow the OT and client ""to explore life’s problems, to discuss support systems, and to brainstorm effective methods of problem resolution."": 2 Importantly, the Kawa model is meant to be used as a flexible guide, meaning ""it can be used differently with each client, centering on the client’s perspective and narrative rather than a specific procedural agenda."": 17 In an interview, Iwama discussed how the model may be used for individuals who may not be able to communicate their life flow for themselves (e.g., individuals with severe cognitive impairments, young children, or people with dementia). In these cases, among others, Iwama suggested communicated with a group of people who are close to the individual to collectively discuss the individual's values, barriers, and priorities and thus, as a group, develop their personal Kawa model and collectively problem-solve how to help the individual's river flow.Some researchers have also suggested using the model for interprofessional discussions regarding clients as a tool to promote team-building collaboration. Importantly, ""teambuilding has been positively correlated with job satisfaction, and quality of client care,"" whereas ""a lack of teamwork can lead to decrease morale/job satisfaction, decreased productivity and lost revenue, and decreased client satisfaction and quality of care."": 2 In one study, Lape et al. used the Kawa model within a collaborate care team to facilitate communication about a patient's care needs. Using the model, the care team was able to develop a ""holistic picture of [the client] that showcased each health care professional’s unique perspective, which was interwoven with the perspectives of the rest of the team."": 3  Participants in the study found that using the model ""provided a common language for interprofessional collaboration"" and could be effectively used within their profession.: 5 


== Strengths ==
""Regardless of how the model was used in the reviewed research, such as a guiding OT approach, a client-centered assessment measure, or a tool to facilitate collaboration, an underlying theme in all studies examined was that the Kawa model provides a unique platform for open communication and deeper perspective. The model’s design aims to be culturally neutral while considering all factors that impact healthy life flow. This supports the model’s use as a tool in adaptable ways. All literature reviewed recommended further studies to support and investigate the use of the Kawa model in diverse contexts.""


=== Culturally responsive ===
More and more, occupational therapists (OTs) are recognizing that occupational therapy must be culturally aware and relevant to meet the needs of clients. In large part, this is because an individual’s values, beliefs, ways of thinking and behaving are dependent upon their cultural backgrounds. Therefore, ""without cultural consideration occupational therapy may, in fact, be oppressive and counterproductive."": 222 Many occupational therapists (OT) consider the Kawa model to be culturally responsive. This is, in part, because the model was developed outside the Western world and does not rely upon ""Western cultural norms."": 213  For example, occupational therapy models often focus on the future, despite some cultures being more focused on the past and present. Additionally, because the model was developed by Japanese OTs, it has a more collectivistic focus than many Western models. In part, this means the model embraces ""interdependence within the social environment"": 371  and the importance of relationships. Overall, ""the tenets of autonomy, self-sufficiency, and individual control, or superiority of the environment, commonly promoted by traditional models of occupation, do not take precedence within the Kawa model."": 372 


=== Therapeutic partnership between the client and clinician ===
Many occupational therapists (OTs) find that the Kawa model helps develop a therapeutic partnership between the client and the clinician. Because the model is client- centered (see below), it requires discussion between the OT and the client, as well as collaboration between them throughout the process, including discussions regarding the client's values and priorities, goal-setting, and more.


=== Client-centered approach ===
More and more, occupational therapists (OTs) aim to keep their clients at the center of occupational therapy work, focusing on the client's perceived needs and priorities rather than focusing on pathologising clients' bodies. In part, this is because ""a person’s view on what is meaningful to them is unique"".: 222  That is, instead of deciding upon a set of practices that may be considered universally beneficial, OTs focus on what clients personally find valuable in their life. For example, OTs may spend time helping clients meaningfully participate in hobbies they enjoy (e.g., playing guitar) rather than focusing solely on necessary living tasks (e.g., bathing) and work tasks (e.g., typing on a keyboard). 
Further, OTs are focusing on how they can teach client's skills, as well as how they can modify environments, to address their perceived needs.Many occupational therapists (OT) find that the Kawa model is highly client- centered, which helps OTs understand the client's perspectives and priorities. In part, this is because the model encourages OTs to discuss with clients what they perceive as barriers, strengths, and opportunities. Including clients in this discussion is ""essential in facilitating an understanding of what is important and meaningful to clients and consequently facilitates their engagement in therapy."": 230  Importantly, clients are also actively involved in goal-setting, which both centers the clients' values and increases their motivation to participate in therapy.


=== Interprofessional collaboration ===
Many occupational therapists (OT) find that the Kawa model helps facilitate interprofessional collaboration.


== Limitations and criticisms ==
While many conceptual frameworks may be difficult to grasp, multiple studies have found that occupational therapists (OTs) who are new to the Kawa model, as well as those new to occupational therapy, may struggle to use the model with clients. In part, this difficulty may result from an OT's lack of understanding regarding the model's foundational concepts.OTs' difficulty with use may also be due to their preconceptions of the model and metaphor. That is, OTs may have a specific belief about how the model should be used, and when a client has a ""unique interpretation,"": 232  they may find difficulty working with the client. However, as discussed above, OTs are encouraged to center the clients' perspectives, including their personal and cultural interpretations of the model and occupational therapy.
Conversely, clients may struggle with the metaphor and/or be skeptical about its use. Iwama noted that ""Westerners looking at the model for the first time may be concerned about where the ‘self’ is located in the model."": 140  This can be seen in some studies in which a participant described the river as ""one big wave hitting me over and over again."": 4 Further, the Kawa model relies upon in-depth discussions with clients. As such, OTs who do not have practice conversing with clients in-depth may struggle to understand their clients' perspectives and needs. However, OTs with proficient interviewing skills may be ""more confident in facilitating and guiding the participants to complete their drawings without fear of errors."": 233 The model's ambiguity may also be cause for criticism and impact ease of use. Individual's ability to connect with the metaphor can impact how well clients communicate their occupational needs. Some researchers have also noted that the model doesn't focus on the individual's inner self, that is, the unique and independent part of them that is separate from their surroundings. They also posit that it doesn't pay enough attention to the idea of belonging, which involves being actively involved in a social group and having specific roles and routines. This ambiguity may also result in the OT imposing their own views and biases.

The Gardens of Harlem,"The Gardens of Harlem is an album by multi-instrumentalist and composer Clifford Thornton. It was recorded at the Blue Rock Studio in New York City in April 1974, and was released in 1975 by JCOA Records. On the album, Thornton is joined by members of the Jazz Composer's Orchestra, supplemented by seven musicians playing African percussion instruments. The music was conducted by Jack Jeffers.


== Reception ==
In an article for London Jazz News, Jon Turney stated: ""Clifford Thornton... led the final release credited to the co-operative Jazz Composers' Orchestra, and it's a great one. The multiple African percussion that features prominently in the early pieces here energises the music wonderfully. And as the notes made clear, that collection of sounds arises because the whole work explores West African music and how it has travelled 'from West to North Africa, the Caribbean, the South Eastern United States, to Harlem'. He evoked that history by selecting vocal melodies from the territories in question, and orchestrating them... They are fine tunes, orchestrated with great skill, and evocative in their own right. Add some great jazz soloing, and it's a heady brew.""John Corbett called Thornton ""another figure whose thin discography distorts his real significance,"" and described the album as ""gorgeous, majestic, intricate.""Writing for The Rolling Stone Jazz Record Guide, Fred Goodman commented: ""this... album... remains one of the more satisfying fusions of traditional Third World musics with the American jazz tradition. Thornton's compositions get superb treatment here from the Jazz Composer's Orchestra... Gardens of Harlem weaves together into one grand tapestry the many experimental directions being pursued on the New York scene during that period.""David Hollenberg, in a 1976 review for Mother Jones, commented: ""The Jazz Composer's Orchestra... have published ten records... All are ambitious and honest, especially a recent album entitled The Gardens of Harlem... It is not the first time that a jazz musician has attempted to integrate 'primitive' music with jazz... but it is to my knowledge the most thorough and believable attempt.""In a review for AllMusic, Eugene Chadbourne wrote: ""There was something of a struggle getting this project finished and released... Gardens of Harlem... perpetually in the oven or being rehearsed in dribs and drabs, was to be [Thornton's] masterpiece, bringing together Afro-Cuban, Jamaican, Ghanaian, Algerian, American blues, and gospel influences as well as a piece based on the cry of a South Carolina fruit vendor. A massive cast was to be involved, including some hot avant-garde jazz soloists and a stage full of percussionists. Slightly more than 50 minutes was eventually released, and the good moments are truly riveting, making one long for the version of this album that might have been created had someone with deeper pockets been around... it is a shame Thornton was unable to create a larger body of work with this kind of vision.""

Jacque Vaughn,"Jacque T. Vaughn (born February 11, 1975) is an American professional basketball coach and former player who is the head coach for the Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Vaughn played in the NBA for the Nets, Utah Jazz, Atlanta Hawks, Orlando Magic, and San Antonio Spurs from 1997 to 2009.


== Playing career ==


=== High school ===
A native of Altadena, California, Vaughn attended John Muir High School in nearby Pasadena, where he maintained a 3.94 GPA, and became the best high school player in that area since former Muir and NBA standout Stacey Augmon. Vaughn excelled both on and off the court, and by his senior year was ranked as high as the no. 7 high school recruit in the country and the no. 2 point guard in the class of 1993 behind arguably the nation's top player that year, Randy Livingston. Over the course of the season, Vaughn averaged over 21 points and 19 assists per game, while also compiling six triple-doubles. Named a First-Team All-American by nearly every publication on the market, Vaughn rounded off his special season with a selection to participate in the prestigious McDonald's All-American Game where he put on a show, scoring only 6 points but amassing 13 assists (still a McDonald's record), while also thoroughly outplaying the higher-ranked Livingston once again—this time on a national stage (they had both matched up against each other in the All-Star Game of the 1992 Nike Camp), and was named co-MVP with North Carolina's Jerry Stackhouse in the process. After considering Georgetown, Indiana, UNLV, Arizona and UCLA, Vaughn decided to play for coach Roy Williams at Kansas, continuing, along with fellow recruit and college roommate Scot Pollard, the California pipeline of high school hoopsters to Lawrence, Kansas, started by former standouts Adonis Jordan and Rex Walters, and continuing in later years with Paul Pierce and Eric Chenowith.
As a senior in high school in 1992, Vaughn was awarded the Dial Award as the nation's top male high school scholar-athlete, becoming the first basketball player ever to win that award.


=== College ===
In his college career Vaughn became the starting point guard as a freshman after being chosen to replace incumbent starter Calvin Rayford. Among his first-year highlights were earning the MVP award at the 1993 Pre-Season NIT at Madison Square Garden in New York City and hitting a game-winning three pointer at the overtime buzzer to beat Indiana in an early season game at Allen Fieldhouse. Throughout his four years at Kansas, Vaughn was known as a good distributor of the basketball and effective defender with great speed and court awareness. By the end of his college career, he was the all-time leader in assists in Kansas basketball history with 804 total (since surpassed by Aaron Miles), as well as the Big Eight Conference's all-time record holder. In 1995, Vaugn was named Arthur Ashe Jr. Sports Scholar by Diverse: Issues In Higher Education. Additionally in 1997, the award given annually to the school's assist leader was renamed to include Vaughn, Miles and original assists leader, Cedric Hunter, as the Hunter/Vaughn/Miles Assists Award.
Vaughn earned a 3.72 GPA as a business administration major. He was a two-time Academic All-American at Kansas and the 1997 GTE Academic All-American of the Year. He was also a two-time all-conference pick and was named the Big Eight Player of the Year in 1996. His college jersey was retired on December 31, 2002, and hangs in the rafters of Allen Fieldhouse.


=== Professional ===
In 1997, Vaughn was selected 27th overall by the Utah Jazz in the 1997 NBA draft. In addition to playing four seasons in Utah, Vaughn also played with the Orlando Magic, the Atlanta Hawks (in two separate stints), New Jersey Nets, and San Antonio Spurs. He appeared in 64 games for the NBA champion San Antonio Spurs during the 2006–07 season and finished his career there, retiring after the 2008–09 season. Over his career, he averaged 4.5 points per game and 2.5 assists per game. He also set an NBA record for consecutive missed field goal attempts to open a season, missing his first 22 to start the 2001 season with the Atlanta Hawks. After those 22 straight misses he shot a career best 47 percent that season.

Slavery,"Slavery is the ownership of a person as property, especially in regards to their labor. Slavery typically involves compulsory work with the slave's location of work and residence dictated by the party that holds them in bondage. Enslavement is the placement of a person into slavery, and the person is called a slave or an enslaved person (see 
§ Terminology).
Many historical cases of enslavement occurred as a result of breaking the law, becoming indebted, suffering a military defeat, or exploitation for cheaper labor; other forms of slavery were instituted along demographic lines such as race or sex. Slaves may be kept in bondage for life, or for a fixed period of time after which they would be granted freedom. Although slavery is usually involuntary and involves coercion, there are also cases where people voluntarily enter into slavery to pay a debt or earn money due to poverty. In the course of human history, slavery was a typical feature of civilization, and was legal in most societies, but it is now outlawed in most countries of the world, except as a punishment for a crime.In chattel slavery, the slave is legally rendered the personal property (chattel) of the slave owner. In economics, the term de facto slavery describes the conditions of unfree labour and forced labour that most slaves endure.The Islamic Republic of Mauritania was the last country in the world to officially ban slavery, in 1981,  with legal prosecution of slaveholders established in 2007. However, in 2019, approximately 40 million people, of whom 26% were children, were still enslaved throughout the world despite slavery being illegal. In the modern world, more than 50% of slaves provide forced labour, usually in the factories and sweatshops of the private sector of a country's economy. In industrialised countries, human trafficking is a modern variety of slavery; in non-industrialised countries, enslavement by debt bondage is a common form of enslaving a person, such as captive domestic servants, people in forced marriages, and child soldiers.


== Terminology ==
The word slave arrived in modern English from Middle English sclave, from Old French esclave, from Late Middle High German sklave, from Medieval Latin sclāvus, from Late Latin Sclāvus, from Byzantine Greek Σκλάβος [Sklábos], Έσκλαβήνος [Ésklabḗnos].
According to the widespread view, which has been known since the 18th century, Byzantine Σκλάβινοι [Sklábinoi], Έσκλαβηνοί [Ésklabēnoí], borrowed from Slavic gen self-name *Slověninŭ turned into Σκλάβος, Έσκλαβήνος (Late Latin Sclāvus) in the meaning 'prisoner of war Slave', 'slave' in 8th/9th century, because they often became captured and enslaved. However this version has been disputed since the 19th century.An alternative contemporary hypothesis states that Medieval Latin sclāvus via *scylāvus derives from Byzantine σκυλάω [skūláō, skyláō], σκυλεύω [skūleúō, skyleúō] – ""to strip the enemy (killed in a battle)"", ""to make booty / extract spoils of war"". This version is criticized as well.There is a dispute among historians about whether terms such as ""unfree labourer"" or ""enslaved person"", rather than ""slave"", should be used when describing the victims of slavery. According to those proposing a change in terminology, slave perpetuates the crime of slavery in language by reducing its victims to a nonhuman noun instead of ""carry[ing] them forward as people, not the property that they were"" (see also People-first language). Other historians prefer slave because the term is familiar and shorter, or because it accurately reflects the inhumanity of slavery, with person implying a degree of autonomy that slavery does not allow.


=== Chattel slavery ===
As a social institution, chattel slavery classes slaves as chattels (personal property) owned by the enslaver; like livestock, they can be bought and sold at will. Chattel slavery was practiced in places such as the Roman Empire and classical Greece, where it was considered a keystone of society. Other places where it was extensively practiced include Brazil, the United States and parts of the Caribbean such as Cuba and Haiti.Beginning in the 18th century, a series of abolitionist movements saw slavery as a violation of the slaves' rights as people (""all men are created equal""), and sought to abolish it. Abolitionism encountered extreme resistance but was eventually successful. In the United States it was abolished in 1865 and in Cuba in 1886. The last country in the Americas to abolish slavery was Brazil, in 1888. The last country to abolish slavery, Mauritania, did so in 1981. The 1981 ban on slavery was not effectively enforced in practice, as there were no legal mechanisms to prosecute those who used slaves. This only came in 2007.


=== Bonded labour ===

Indenture, also known as bonded labour or debt bondage, is a form of unfree labour in which a person works to pay off a debt by pledging himself or herself as collateral. The services required to repay the debt, and their duration, may be undefined. Debt bondage can be passed on from generation to generation, with children required to pay off their progenitors' debt. It is the most widespread form of slavery today. Debt bondage is most prevalent in South Asia. Money marriage refers to a marriage where a girl, usually, is married off to a man to settle debts owed by her parents. The Chukri system is a debt bondage system found in parts of Bengal where a female can be coerced into prostitution in order to pay off debts.


=== Dependents ===
The word ""slavery"" has also been used to refer to a legal state of dependency to somebody else. For example, in Persia, the situations and lives of such slaves could be better than those of common citizens.


=== Forced labour ===

 
Forced labour, or unfree labour, is sometimes used to describe an individual who is forced to work against their own will, under threat of violence or other punishment. This may also include institutions not commonly classified as slavery, such as serfdom, conscription and penal labour. As slavery has been legally outlawed in all countries, forced labour in the present day (frequently referred to as ""modern slavery"") revolves around illegal control.
Human trafficking primarily involves women and children forced into prostitution and is the fastest growing form of forced labour, with Thailand, Cambodia, India, Brazil and Mexico having been identified as leading hotspots of commercial sexual exploitation of children.


==== Child soldiers and child labor ====

In 2007, Human Rights Watch estimated that 200,000 to 300,000 children served as soldiers in then-current conflicts. More girls under 16 work as domestic workers than any other category of child labour, often sent to cities by parents living in rural poverty as with the Haitian restaveks.


=== Forced marriage ===

Forced marriages or early marriages are often considered types of slavery. Forced marriage continues to be practiced in parts of the world including some parts of Asia and Africa and in immigrant communities in the West. Marriage by abduction occurs in many places in the world today, with a 2003 study finding a national average of 69% of marriages in Ethiopia being through abduction.


=== Other uses of the term ===
The word slavery is often used as a pejorative to describe any activity in which one is coerced into performing. Some argue that military drafts and other forms of coerced government labour constitute ""state-operated slavery."" Some libertarians and anarcho-capitalists view government taxation as a form of slavery.""Slavery"" has been used by some anti-psychiatry proponents to define involuntary psychiatric patients, claiming there are no unbiased physical tests for mental illness and yet the psychiatric patient must follow the orders of the psychiatrist. They assert that instead of chains to control the slave, the psychiatrist uses drugs to control the mind. Drapetomania was a pseudoscientific psychiatric diagnosis for a slave who desired freedom; ""symptoms"" included laziness and the tendency to flee captivity.Some proponents of animal rights have applied the term slavery to the condition of some or all human-owned animals, arguing that their status is comparable to that of human slaves.The labour market, as institutionalized under contemporary capitalist systems, has been criticized by mainstream socialists and by anarcho-syndicalists, who utilise the term wage slavery as a pejorative or dysphemism for wage labour. Socialists draw parallels between the trade of labour as a commodity and slavery. Cicero is also known to have suggested such parallels.


== Characteristics ==


=== Economics ===
Economists have modeled the circumstances under which slavery (and variants such as serfdom) appear and disappear. One observation is that slavery becomes more desirable for landowners where land is abundant, but labour is scarce, such that rent is depressed and paid workers can demand high wages. If the opposite holds true, then it is more costly for landowners to guard the slaves than to employ paid workers who can demand only low wages because of the degree of competition. Thus, first slavery and then serfdom gradually decreased in Europe as the population grew. They were reintroduced in the Americas and in Russia as large areas of land with few inhabitants became available.Slavery is more common when the tasks are relatively simple and thus easy to supervise, such as large-scale monocrops such as sugarcane and cotton, in which output depended on economies of scale. This enables systems of labour, such as the gang system in the United States, to become prominent on large plantations where field hands toiled with factory-like precision. Then, each work gang was based on an internal division of labour that assigned every member of the gang to a task and made each worker's performance dependent on the actions of the others. The slaves chopped out the weeds that surrounded the cotton plants as well as excess sprouts. Plow gangs followed behind, stirring the soil near the plants and tossing it back around the plants. Thus, the gang system worked like an assembly line.Since the 18th century, critics have argued that slavery hinders technological advancement because the focus is on increasing the number of slaves doing simple tasks rather than upgrading their efficiency. For example, it is sometimes argued that, because of this narrow focus, technology in Greece – and later in Rome – was not applied to ease physical labour or improve manufacturing.
Scottish economist Adam Smith stated that free labour was economically better than slave labour, and that it was nearly impossible to end slavery in a free, democratic, or republican form of government since many of its legislators or political figures were slave owners and would not punish themselves. He further stated that slaves would be better able to gain their freedom under centralized government, or a central authority like a king or church. Similar arguments appeared later in the works of Auguste Comte, especially given Smith's belief in the separation of powers, or what Comte called the ""separation of the spiritual and the temporal"" during the Middle Ages and the end of slavery, and Smith's criticism of masters, past and present. As Smith stated in the Lectures on Jurisprudence, ""The great power of the clergy thus concurring with that of the king set the slaves at liberty. But it was absolutely necessary both that the authority of the king and of the clergy should be great. Where ever any one of these was wanting, slavery still continues...""
Even after slavery became a criminal offense, slave owners could get high returns. According to researcher Siddharth Kara, the profits generated worldwide by all forms of slavery in 2007 were $91.2 billion. That was second only to drug trafficking, in terms of global criminal enterprises. At the time the weighted average global sales price of a slave was estimated to be approximately $340, with a high of $1,895 for the average trafficked sex slave, and a low of $40 to $50 for debt bondage slaves in part of Asia and Africa. The weighted average annual profits generated by a slave in 2007 was $3,175, with a low of an average $950 for bonded labour and $29,210 for a trafficked sex slave. Approximately 40% of slave profits each year were generated by trafficked sex slaves, representing slightly more than 4% of the world's 29 million slaves.


=== Identification ===
A widespread practice was branding, either to explicitly mark slaves as property or as punishment.


== Legal aspects ==


=== Private versus state-owned slaves ===
Slaves have been owned privately by individuals but have also been under state ownership. For example, the kisaeng were women from low castes in pre modern Korea, who were owned by the state under government officials known as hojang and were required to provide entertainment to the aristocracy; in the 2020s some are denoted Kippumjo (the pleasure brigades of North Korea — serving as the concubines of the rulers of the state). ""Tribute labor"" is compulsory labor for the state and has been used in various iterations such as corvée, mit'a and repartimiento. The internment camps of totalitarian regimes such as the Nazis and the Soviet Union placed increasing importance on the labor provided in those camps, leading to a growing tendency among historians to designate such systems as slavery.A combination of these include the encomienda where the Spanish Crown granted private individuals the right to the free labour of a specified number of natives in a given area. In the ""Red Rubber System"" of both the Congo Free State and French ruled Ubangi-Shari, labour was demanded as taxation; private companies were conceded areas within which they were allowed to use any measures to increase rubber production. Convict leasing was common in the Southern United States where the state would lease prisoners for their free labour to companies.


=== Legal rights ===
Depending upon the era and the country, slaves sometimes had a limited set of legal rights. For example, in the Province of New York, people who deliberately killed slaves were punishable under a 1686 statute. And, as already mentioned, certain legal rights attached to the nobi in Korea, to slaves in various African societies, and to black female slaves in the French colony of Louisiana. Giving slaves legal rights has sometimes been a matter of morality, but also sometimes a matter of self-interest. For example, in ancient Athens, protecting slaves from mistreatment simultaneously protected people who might be mistaken for slaves, and giving slaves limited property rights incentivized slaves to work harder to get more property. In the southern United States prior to the extirpation of slavery in 1865, a proslavery legal treatise reported that slaves accused of crimes typically had a legal right to counsel, freedom from double jeopardy, a right to trial by jury in graver cases, and the right to grand jury indictment, but they lacked many other rights such as white adults' ability to control their own lives.


== History ==

Slavery predates written records and has existed in many cultures. Slavery is rare among hunter-gatherer populations because it requires economic surpluses and a substantial population density. Thus, although it has existed among unusually resource-rich hunter gatherers, such as the American Indian peoples of the salmon-rich rivers of the Pacific Northwest coast, slavery became widespread only with the invention of agriculture during the Neolithic Revolution about 11,000 years ago. Slavery was practiced in almost every ancient civilization. Such institutions included debt bondage, punishment for crime, the enslavement of prisoners of war, child abandonment, and the enslavement of slaves' offspring.


=== Africa ===

Slavery was widespread in Africa, which pursued both internal and external slave trade. In the Senegambia region, between 1300 and 1900, close to one-third of the population was enslaved. In early Islamic states of the western Sahel, including Ghana, Mali, Segou, and Songhai, about a third of the population were enslaved.In European courtly society, and European aristocracy, black African slaves and their children became visible in the late 1300s and 1400s. Starting with Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, black Africans were included in the retinue. In 1402 an Ethiopian embassy reached Venice. In the 1470s black Africans were painted as court attendants in wall paintings that were displayed in Mantua and Ferrara. In the 1490s black Africans were included on the emblem of the Duke of Milan.
During the trans-Saharan slave trade, slaves from West Africa were transported across the Sahara desert to North Africa to be sold to Mediterranean and Middle eastern civilizations. The Indian Ocean slave trade, sometimes known as the east African slave trade, was multi-directional. Africans were sent as slaves to the Arabian Peninsula, to Indian Ocean islands (including Madagascar), to the Indian subcontinent, and later to the Americas. These traders captured Bantu peoples (Zanj) from the interior in present-day Kenya, Mozambique and Tanzania and brought them to the coast. There, the slaves gradually assimilated in rural areas, particularly on Unguja and Pemba islands.Some historians assert that as many as 17 million people were sold into slavery on the coast of the Indian Ocean, the Middle East, and North Africa, and approximately 5 million African slaves were bought by Muslim slave traders and taken from Africa across the Red Sea, Indian Ocean, and Sahara Desert between 1500 and 1900. The captives were sold throughout the Middle East. This trade accelerated as superior ships led to more trade and greater demand for labour on plantations in the region. Eventually, tens of thousands of captives were being taken every year. The Indian Ocean slave trade was multi-directional and changed over time. To meet the demand for menial labour, Bantu slaves bought by east African slave traders from southeastern Africa were sold in cumulatively large numbers over the centuries to customers in Egypt, Arabia, the Persian Gulf, India, European colonies in the Far East, the Indian Ocean islands, Ethiopia and Somalia.According to the Encyclopedia of African History, ""It is estimated that by the 1890s the largest slave population of the world, about 2 million people, was concentrated in the territories of the Sokoto Caliphate. The use of slave labour was extensive, especially in agriculture."" The Anti-Slavery Society estimated there were 2 million slaves in Ethiopia in the early 1930s out of an estimated population of 8 to 16 million.Slave labour in East Africa was drawn from the Zanj, Bantu peoples that lived along the East African coast. The Zanj were for centuries shipped as slaves by Arab traders to all the countries bordering the Indian Ocean. The Umayyad and Abbasid caliphs recruited many Zanj slaves as soldiers and, as early as 696, there were slave revolts of the Zanj against their Arab enslavers in Iraq. The Zanj Rebellion, a series of uprisings that took place between 869 and 883 near Basra (also known as Basara), situated in present-day Iraq, is believed to have involved enslaved Zanj that had originally been captured from the African Great Lakes region and areas further south in East Africa. It grew to involve over 500,000 slaves and free men who were imported from across the Muslim empire and claimed over ""tens of thousands of lives in lower Iraq"".The Zanj who were taken as slaves to the Middle East were often used in strenuous agricultural work. As the plantation economy boomed and the Arabs became richer, agriculture and other manual labour work was thought to be demeaning. The resulting labour shortage led to an increased slave market.

In Algiers, the capital of Algeria, captured Christians and Europeans were forced into slavery. In about 1650, there were as many as 35,000 Christian slaves in Algiers. By one estimate, raids by Barbary slave traders on coastal villages and ships extending from Italy to Iceland, enslaved an estimated 1 to 1.25 million Europeans between the 16th and 19th centuries. However, this estimate is the result of an extrapolation which assumes that the number of European slaves captured by Barbary pirates was constant for a 250-year period:

There are no records of how many men, women and children were enslaved, but it is possible to calculate roughly the number of fresh captives that would have been needed to keep populations steady and replace those slaves who died, escaped, were ransomed, or converted to Islam. On this basis it is thought that around 8,500 new slaves were needed annually to replenish numbers – about 850,000 captives over the century from 1580 to 1680. By extension, for the 250 years between 1530 and 1780, the figure could easily have been as high as 1,250,000.
Davis' numbers have been refuted by other historians, such as David Earle, who cautions that true picture of Europeans slaves is clouded by the fact the corsairs also seized non-Christian whites from eastern Europe. In addition, the number of slaves traded was hyperactive, with exaggerated estimates relying on peak years to calculate averages for entire centuries, or millennia. Hence, there were wide fluctuations year-to-year, particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries, given slave imports, and also given the fact that, prior to the 1840s, there are no consistent records. Middle East expert, John Wright, cautions that modern estimates are based on back-calculations from human observation. Such observations, across the late 16th and early 17th century observers, account for around 35,000 European Christian slaves held throughout this period on the Barbary Coast, across Tripoli, Tunis, but mostly in Algiers. The majority were sailors (particularly those who were English), taken with their ships, but others were fishermen and coastal villagers. However, most of these captives were people from lands close to Africa, particularly Spain and Italy. This eventually led to the bombardment of Algiers by an Anglo-Dutch fleet in 1816.
Under Omani Arabs, Zanzibar became East Africa's main slave port, with as many as 50,000 African slaves passing through every year during the 19th century. Some historians estimate that between 11 and 18 million African slaves crossed the Red Sea, Indian Ocean, and Sahara Desert from 650 to 1900 AD. Eduard Rüppell described the losses of Sudanese slaves being transported on foot to Egypt: ""after the Daftardar bey's 1822 campaign in the southern Nuba mountains, nearly 40,000 slaves were captured. However, through bad treatment, disease and desert travel barely 5,000 made it to Egypt."" W.A. Veenhoven wrote: ""The German doctor, Gustav Nachtigal, an eye-witness, believed that for every slave who arrived at a market three or four died on the way ... Keltie (The Partition of Africa, London, 1920) believes that for every slave the Arabs brought to the coast at least six died on the way or during the slavers' raid. Livingstone puts the figure as high as ten to one.""Systems of servitude and slavery were common in parts of Africa, as they were in much of the ancient world. In many African societies where slavery was prevalent, the slaves were not treated as chattel slaves and were given certain rights in a system similar to indentured servitude elsewhere in the world. The forms of slavery in Africa were closely related to kinship structures. In many African communities, where land could not be owned, enslavement of individuals was used as a means to increase the influence a person had and expand connections. This made slaves a permanent part of a master's lineage and the children of slaves could become closely connected with the larger family ties. Children of slaves born into families could be integrated into the master's kinship group and rise to prominent positions within society, even to the level of chief in some instances. However, stigma often remained attached and there could be strict separations between slave members of a kinship group and those related to the master. Slavery was practiced in many different forms: debt slavery, enslavement of war captives, military slavery, and criminal slavery were all practiced in various parts of Africa. Slavery for domestic and court purposes was widespread throughout Africa.

When the Atlantic slave trade began, many of the local slave systems began supplying captives for chattel slave markets outside Africa. Although the Atlantic slave trade was not the only slave trade from Africa, it was the largest in volume and intensity. As Elikia M'bokolo wrote in Le Monde diplomatique:

The African continent was bled of its human resources via all possible routes. Across the Sahara, through the Red Sea, from the Indian Ocean ports and across the Atlantic. At least ten centuries of slavery for the benefit of the Muslim countries (from the ninth to the nineteenth).... Four million enslaved people exported via the Red Sea, another four million through the Swahili ports of the Indian Ocean, perhaps as many as nine million along the trans-Saharan caravan route, and eleven to twenty million (depending on the author) across the Atlantic Ocean.
The trans-Atlantic slave trade peaked in the late 18th century, when the largest number of slaves were captured on raiding expeditions into the interior of West Africa.
These expeditions were typically carried out by African kingdoms, such as the Oyo Empire (Yoruba), the Ashanti Empire, the kingdom of Dahomey, and the Aro Confederacy. It is estimated that about 15 percent of slaves died during the voyage, with mortality rates considerably higher in Africa itself in the process of capturing and transporting indigenous peoples to the ships.


=== Americas ===

Slavery in Mexico can be traced back to the Aztecs. Other Amerindians, such as the Inca of the Andes, the Tupinambá of Brazil, the Creek of Georgia, and the Comanche of Texas, also practiced slavery.Slavery in Canada was practiced by First Nations and by European settlers. Slave-owning people of what became Canada were, for example, the fishing societies, such as the Yurok, that lived along the Pacific coast from Alaska to California, on what is sometimes described as the Pacific or Northern Northwest Coast. Some of the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast, such as the Haida and Tlingit, were traditionally known as fierce warriors and slave-traders, raiding as far as California. Slavery was hereditary, the slaves being prisoners of war and their descendants were slaves. Some nations in British Columbia continued to segregate and ostracize the descendants of slaves as late as the 1970s.

Slavery in America remains a contentious issue and played a major role in the history and evolution of some countries, triggering a revolution, a civil war, and numerous rebellions.
The countries that controlled the transatlantic slave market in terms of number of slaves shipped were: the United Kingdom, Portugal and France.

In order to establish itself as an American empire, Spain had to fight against the relatively powerful civilizations of the New World. The Spanish conquest of the indigenous peoples in the Americas included using the Natives as forced labour. The Spanish colonies were the first Europeans to use African slaves in the New World on islands such as Cuba and Hispaniola. It was argued by some contemporary writers to be intrinsically immoral. Bartolomé de las Casas, a 16th-century Dominican friar and Spanish historian, participated in campaigns in Cuba (at Bayamo and Camagüey) and was present at the massacre of Hatuey; his observation of that massacre led him to fight for a social movement away from the use of natives as slaves. Also, the alarming decline in the native population had spurred the first royal laws protecting the native population. The first African slaves arrived in Hispaniola in 1501. This era saw a growth in race-based slavery England played a prominent role in the Atlantic slave trade. The ""slave triangle"" was pioneered by Francis Drake and his associates, though English slave-trading would not take off until the mid-17th century.
Many whites who arrived in North America during the 17th and 18th centuries came under contract as indentured servants. The transformation from indentured servitude to slavery was a gradual process in Virginia. The earliest legal documentation of such a shift was in 1640 where a black man, John Punch, was sentenced to lifetime slavery, forcing him to serve his master, Hugh Gwyn, for the remainder of his life, for attempting to run away. This case was significant because it established the disparity between his sentence as a black man and that of the two white indentured servants who escaped with him (one described as Dutch and one as a Scotchman). It is the first documented case of a black man sentenced to lifetime servitude and is considered one of the first legal cases to make a racial distinction between black and white indentured servants.After 1640, planters started to ignore the expiration of indentured contracts and keep their servants as slaves for life. This was demonstrated by the 1655 case Johnson v. Parker, where the court ruled that a black man, Anthony Johnson of Virginia, was granted ownership of another black man, John Casor, as the result of a civil case. This was the first instance of a judicial determination in the Thirteen Colonies holding that a person who had committed no crime could be held in servitude for life.


==== Spanish colonial America ====
In 1519, Hernán Cortés brought the first modern slave to the area. In the mid-16th century, the Spanish New Laws, prohibited slavery of the indigenous people, including the Aztecs. A labour shortage resulted. This led to the African slaves being imported, as they were not susceptible to smallpox. In exchange, many Africans were afforded the opportunity to buy their freedom, while eventually others were granted their freedom by their masters. In Jamaica, the Spanish enslaved many of the Taino; some escaped, but most died from European diseases and overwork. The Spaniards also introduced the first African slaves.Spain practically did not trade in slaves until 1810 after the rebellions and independence of its American territories or viceroyalties. After the Napoleonic invasions, Spain had lost its industry and its American territories, except in Cuba and Puerto Rico, where the African slave trade to Cuba began on a massive scale from 1810 onwards. It was started by French planters exiled from the French lost colony Saint Domingue (Haiti) who settled in the eastern part of Cuba.
In 1789 the Spanish Crown led an effort to reform slavery, as the demand for slave labour in Cuba was growing. The Crown issued a decree, Código Negro Español (Spanish Black Code), that specified food and clothing provisions, put limits on the number of work hours, limited punishments, required religious instruction, and protected marriages, forbidding the sale of young children away from their mothers. The British made other changes to the institution of slavery in Cuba. But planters often flouted the laws and protested against them, considering them a threat to their authority and an intrusion into their personal lives.


==== English and Dutch Caribbean ====
In the early 17th century, the majority of the labour in Barbados was provided by European indentured servants, mainly English, Irish and Scottish, with African and native American slaves providing little of the workforce. The introduction of sugar cane in 1640 completely transformed society and the economy. Barbados eventually had one of the world's largest sugar industries. The workable sugar plantation required a large investment and a great deal of heavy labour. At first, Dutch traders supplied the equipment, financing, and African slaves, in addition to transporting most of the sugar to Europe. In 1644, the population of Barbados was estimated at 30,000, of which about 800 were of African descent, with the remainder mainly of English descent. By 1700, there were 15,000 free whites and 50,000 enslaved Africans. In Jamaica, although the African slave population in the 1670s and 1680s never exceeded 10,000, by 1800 it had increased to over 300,000. The increased implementation of slave codes or black codes, which created differential treatment between Africans and the white workers and ruling planter class. In response to these codes, several slave rebellions were attempted or planned during this time, but none succeeded. 

The planters of the Dutch colony of Suriname relied heavily on African slaves to cultivate, harvest and process the commodity crops of coffee, cocoa, sugar cane and cotton plantations. The Netherlands abolished slavery in Suriname in 1863.
Many slaves escaped the plantations. With the help of the native South Americans living in the adjoining rain forests, these runaway slaves established a new and unique culture in the interior that was highly successful in its own right. They were known collectively in English as Maroons, in French as Nèg'Marrons (literally meaning ""brown negroes"", that is ""pale-skinned negroes""), and in Dutch as Marrons. The Maroons gradually developed several independent tribes through a process of ethnogenesis, as they were made up of slaves from different African ethnicities. These tribes include the Saramaka, Paramaka, Ndyuka or Aukan, Kwinti, Aluku or Boni, and Matawai. The Maroons often raided plantations to recruit new members from the slaves and capture women, as well as to acquire weapons, food and supplies. They sometimes killed planters and their families in the raids. The colonists also mounted armed campaigns against the Maroons, who generally escaped through the rain forest, which they knew much better than did the colonists. To end hostilities, in the 18th century the European colonial authorities signed several peace treaties with different tribes. They granted the Maroons sovereign status and trade rights in their inland territories, giving them autonomy.


==== Brazil ====
Slavery in Brazil began long before the first Portuguese settlement was established in 1532, as members of one tribe would enslave captured members of another.Later, Portuguese colonists were heavily dependent on indigenous labour during the initial phases of settlement to maintain the subsistence economy, and natives were often captured by expeditions called bandeiras. The importation of African slaves began midway through the 16th century, but the enslavement of indigenous peoples continued well into the 17th and 18th centuries.
During the Atlantic slave trade era, Brazil imported more African slaves than any other country. Nearly 5 million slaves were brought from Africa to Brazil during the period from 1501 to 1866. Until the early 1850s, most African slaves who arrived on Brazilian shores were forced to embark at West Central African ports, especially in Luanda (in present-day Angola). Today, with the exception of Nigeria, the country with the largest population of people of African descent is Brazil.Slave labour was the driving force behind the growth of the sugar economy in Brazil, and sugar was the primary export of the colony from 1600 to 1650. Gold and diamond deposits were discovered in Brazil in 1690, which sparked an increase in the importation of African slaves to power this newly profitable market. Transportation systems were developed for the mining infrastructure, and population boomed from immigrants seeking to take part in gold and diamond mining. Demand for African slaves did not wane after the decline of the mining industry in the second half of the 18th century. Cattle ranching and foodstuff production proliferated after the population growth, both of which relied heavily on slave labour. 1.7 million slaves were imported to Brazil from Africa from 1700 to 1800, and the rise of coffee in the 1830s further enticed expansion of the slave trade.
Brazil was the last country in the Western world to abolish slavery. Forty percent of the total number of slaves brought to the Americas were sent to Brazil. For reference, the United States received 10 percent. Despite being abolished, there are still people working in slavery-like conditions in Brazil in the 21st century.


==== Haiti ====
Slavery in Haiti started with the arrival of Christopher Columbus on the island in 1492. The practice was devastating to the native population. Following the indigenous Taíno's near decimation from forced labour, disease and war, the Spanish, under advisement of the Catholic priest Bartolomé de las Casas, and with the blessing of the Catholic church, who also wished to protect the indigenous people, began engaging in earnest in the use of African slaves. During the French colonial period beginning in 1625, the economy of Haiti (then known as Saint-Domingue) was based on slavery, and the practice there was regarded as the most brutal in the world.

Following the Treaty of Ryswick of 1697, Hispaniola was divided between France and Spain. France received the western third and subsequently named it Saint-Domingue. To develop it into sugarcane plantations, the French imported thousands of slaves from Africa. Sugar was a lucrative commodity crop throughout the 18th century. By 1789, approximately 40,000 white colonists lived in Saint-Domingue. The whites were vastly outnumbered by the tens of thousands of African slaves they had imported to work on their plantations, which were primarily devoted to the production of sugarcane. In the north of the island, slaves were able to retain many ties to African cultures, religion and language; these ties were continually being renewed by newly imported Africans. Blacks outnumbered whites by about ten to one.
The French-enacted Code Noir (""Black Code""), prepared by Jean-Baptiste Colbert and ratified by Louis XIV, had established rules on slave treatment and permissible freedoms. Saint-Domingue has been described as one of the most brutally efficient slave colonies; one-third of newly imported Africans died within a few years. Many slaves died from diseases such as smallpox and typhoid fever. They had birth rates around 3 percent, and there is evidence that some women aborted fetuses, or committed infanticide, rather than allow their children to live within the bonds of slavery.As in its Louisiana colony, the French colonial government allowed some rights to free people of color: the mixed-race descendants of white male colonists and black female slaves (and later, mixed-race women). Over time, many were released from slavery. They established a separate social class. White French Creole fathers frequently sent their mixed-race sons to France for their education. Some men of color were admitted into the military. More of the free people of color lived in the south of the island, near Port-au-Prince, and many intermarried within their community. They frequently worked as artisans and tradesmen, and began to own some property. Some became slave holders. The free people of color petitioned the colonial government to expand their rights.
Slaves that made it to Haiti from the trans-Atlantic journey and slaves born in Haiti were first documented in Haiti's archives and transferred to France's Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. As of 2015, these records are in The National Archives of France. According to the 1788 Census, Haiti's population consisted of nearly 40,000 whites, 30,000 free coloureds and 450,000 slaves.The Haitian Revolution of 1804, the only successful slave revolt in human history, precipitated the end of slavery in all French colonies, which came in 1848.


==== United States ====
Slavery in the United States was the legal institution of human chattel enslavement, primarily of Africans and African Americans, that existed in the United States of America in the 18th and 19th centuries, after it gained independence from the British and before the end of the American Civil War. Slavery had been practiced in British America from early colonial days and was legal in all Thirteen Colonies, at the time of the Declaration of Independence in 1776. By the time of the American Revolution, the status of slave had been institutionalized as a racial caste associated with African ancestry. The United States became polarized over the issue of slavery, represented by the slave and free states divided by the Mason–Dixon line, which separated free Pennsylvania from slave Maryland and Delaware.
Congress, during the Jefferson administration, prohibited the importation of slaves, effective 1808, although smuggling (illegal importing) was not unusual. Domestic slave trading, however, continued at a rapid pace, driven by labour demands from the development of cotton plantations in the Deep South. Those states attempted to extend slavery into the new western territories to keep their share of political power in the nation. Such laws proposed to Congress to continue the spread of slavery into newly ratified states include the Kansas-Nebraska Act.
The treatment of slaves in the United States varied widely depending on conditions, times, and places. The power relationships of slavery corrupted many whites who had authority over slaves, with children showing their own cruelty. Masters and overseers resorted to physical punishments to impose their wills. Slaves were punished by whipping, shackling, hanging, beating, burning, mutilation, branding and imprisonment. Punishment was most often meted out in response to disobedience or perceived infractions, but sometimes abuse was carried out to re-assert the dominance of the master or overseer of the slave. Treatment was usually harsher on large plantations, which were often managed by overseers and owned by absentee slaveholders.
William Wells Brown, who escaped to freedom, reported that on one plantation, slave men were required to pick 80 pounds (36 kg) of cotton per day, while women were required to pick 70 pounds (32 kg) per day; if any slave failed in their quota, they were subject to whip lashes for each pound they were short. The whipping post stood next to the cotton scales. A New York man who attended a slave auction in the mid-19th century reported that at least three-quarters of the male slaves he saw at sale had scars on their backs from whipping. By contrast, small slave-owning families had closer relationships between the owners and slaves; this sometimes resulted in a more humane environment but was not a given.More than one million slaves were sold from the Upper South, which had a surplus of labour, and taken to the Deep South in a forced migration, splitting up many families. New communities of African American culture were developed in the Deep South, and the total slave population in the South eventually reached 4 million before liberation. In the 19th century, proponents of slavery often defended the institution as a ""necessary evil"". White people of that time feared that emancipation of black slaves would have more harmful social and economic consequences than the continuation of slavery. The French writer and traveler Alexis de Tocqueville, in Democracy in America (1835), expressed opposition to slavery while observing its effects on American society. He felt that a multiracial society without slavery was untenable, as he believed that prejudice against black people increased as they were granted more rights. Others, like James Henry Hammond argued that slavery was a ""positive good"" stating: ""Such a class you must have, or you would not have that other class which leads progress, civilization, and refinement.""
The Southern state governments wanted to keep a balance between the number of slave and free states to maintain a political balance of power in Congress. The new territories acquired from Britain, France, and Mexico were the subject of major political compromises. By 1850, the newly rich cotton-growing South was threatening to secede from the Union, and tensions continued to rise. Many white Southern Christians, including church ministers, attempted to justify their support for slavery as modified by Christian paternalism. The largest denominations, the Baptist, Methodist, and Presbyterian churches, split over the slavery issue into regional organizations of the North and South.

When Abraham Lincoln won the 1860 election on a platform of halting the expansion of slavery, according to the 1860 U.S. census, roughly 400,000 individuals, representing 8% of all U.S. families, owned nearly 4,000,000 slaves. One-third of Southern families owned slaves. The South was heavily invested in slavery. As such, upon Lincoln's election, seven states broke away to form the Confederate States of America. The first six states to secede held the greatest number of slaves in the South. Shortly after, over the issue of slavery, the United States erupted into an all-out Civil War, with slavery legally ceasing as an institution following the war in December 1865.
In 1865, the United States ratified the 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which banned slavery and involuntary servitude ""except as punishment for a crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted,"" providing a legal basis for forced labor to continue in the country. This led to the system of convict leasing, which affected primarily African Americans. The Prison Policy Initiative, an American criminal justice think tank, cites the 2020 US prison population as 2.3 million, and nearly all able-bodied inmates work in some fashion. In Texas, Georgia, Alabama and Arkansas, prisoners are not paid at all for their work. In other states, prisoners are paid between $0.12 and $1.15 per hour. Federal Prison Industries paid inmates an average of $0.90 per hour in 2017. Inmates who refuse to work may be indefinitely remanded into solitary confinement or have family visitation revoked. From 2010 to 2015 and again in 2016 and in 2018, some prisoners in the US refused to work, protesting for better pay, better conditions, and for the end of forced labor. Strike leaders were punished with indefinite solitary confinement. Forced prison labor occurs in both government-run prisons and private prisons. CoreCivic and GEO Group constitute half the market share of private prisons, and they made a combined revenue of $3.5 billion in 2015. The value of all labor by inmates in the United States is estimated to be in the billions. In California, 2,500 incarcerated workers fought wildfires for only $1 per hour through the CDCR's Conservation Camp Program, which saves the state as much as $100 million a year.

==== East Asia ====

Slavery existed in ancient China as early as the Shang dynasty. Slavery was employed largely by governments as a means of maintaining a public labour force. Many Han Chinese were enslaved in the process of the Mongol invasion of China proper. According to Japanese historians Sugiyama Masaaki (杉山正明) and Funada Yoshiyuki (舩田善之), Mongolian slaves were owned by Han Chinese during the Yuan dynasty. Slavery has taken various forms throughout China's history. It was reportedly abolished as a legally recognized institution, including in a 1909 law fully enacted in 1910, although the practice continued until at least 1949. Tang Chinese soldiers and pirates enslaved Koreans, Turks, Persians, Indonesians, and people from Inner Mongolia, central Asia, and northern India. The greatest source of slaves came from southern tribes, including Thais and aboriginals from the southern provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Guizhou. Malays, Khmers, Indians, and ""black skinned"" peoples (who were either Austronesian Negritos of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands, or Africans, or both) were also purchased as slaves in the Tang dynasty. In the 17th century Qing dynasty, there was a hereditarily servile people called Booi Aha (Manchu: booi niyalma; Chinese transliteration: 包衣阿哈), which is a Manchu word literally translated as ""household person"" and sometimes rendered as ""nucai."" The Manchu was establishing close personal and paternalist relationship between masters and their slaves, as Nurhachi said, ""The Master should love the slaves and eat the same food as him"". However, booi aha ""did not correspond exactly to the Chinese category of ""bond-servant slave"" (Chinese:奴僕); instead, it was a relationship of personal dependency on a master which in theory guaranteed close personal relationships and equal treatment, even though many western scholars would directly translate ""booi"" as ""bond-servant"" (some of the ""booi"" even had their own servant). Chinese Muslim (Tungans) Sufis who were charged with practicing xiejiao (heterodox religion), were punished by exile to Xinjiang and being sold as a slave to other Muslims, such as the Sufi begs. Han Chinese who committed crimes such as those dealing with opium became slaves to the begs, this practice was administered by Qing law. Most Chinese in Altishahr were exile slaves to Turkestani Begs. While free Chinese merchants generally did not engage in relationships with East Turkestani women, some of the Chinese slaves belonging to begs, along with Green Standard soldiers, Bannermen, and Manchus, engaged in affairs with the East Turkestani women that were serious in nature.
Slavery in Korea existed since before the Three Kingdoms of Korea period, in the first century BCE. Slavery has been described as ""very important in medieval Korea, probably more important than in any other East Asian country, but by the 16th century, population growth was making [it] unnecessary"". Slavery went into decline around the 10th century but came back in the late Goryeo period when Korea also experienced multiple slave rebellions. In the Joseon period of Korea, members of the slave class were known as nobi. The nobi were socially indistinct from freemen (i.e., the middle and common classes) other than the ruling yangban class, and some possessed property rights, and legal and civil rights. Hence, some scholars argue that it is inappropriate to call them ""slaves"", while some scholars describe them as serfs. The nobi population could fluctuate up to about one-third of the total, but on average the nobi made up about 10% of the total population. In 1801, the majority of government nobi were emancipated, and by 1858, the nobi population stood at about 1.5 percent of the Korean population. During the Joseon period, the nobi population could fluctuate up to about one-third of the population, but on average the nobi made up about 10% of the total population. The nobi system declined beginning in the 18th century. Since the outset of the Joseon dynasty and especially beginning in the 17th century, there was harsh criticism among prominent thinkers in Korea about the nobi system. Even within the Joseon government, there were indications of a shift in attitude toward the nobi. King Yeongjo implemented a policy of gradual emancipation in 1775, and he and his successor King Jeongjo made many proposals and developments that lessened the burden on nobi, which led to the emancipation of the vast majority of government nobi in 1801. In addition, population growth, numerous escaped slaves, growing commercialization of agriculture, and the rise of the independent small farmer class contributed to the decline in the number of nobi to about 1.5% of the total population by 1858. The hereditary nobi system was officially abolished around 1886–87, and the rest of the nobi system was abolished with the Gabo Reform of 1894. However, slavery did not completely disappear in Korea until 1930, during Imperial Japanese rule. During the Imperial Japanese occupation of Korea around World War II, some Koreans were used in forced labour by the Imperial Japanese, in conditions which have been compared to slavery. These included women forced into sexual slavery by the Imperial Japanese Army before and during World War II, known as ""comfort women"".After the Portuguese first made contact with Japan in 1543, slave trade developed in which Portuguese purchased Japanese as slaves in Japan and sold them to various locations overseas, including Portugal, throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. Many documents mention the slave trade along with protests against the enslavement of Japanese. Japanese slaves are believed to be the first of their nation to end up in Europe, and the Portuguese purchased numbers of Japanese slave girls to bring to Portugal for sexual purposes, as noted by the Church in 1555. Japanese slave women were even sold as concubines to Asian lascar and African crew members, along with their European counterparts serving on Portuguese ships trading in Japan, mentioned by Luis Cerqueira, a Portuguese Jesuit, in a 1598 document. Japanese slaves were brought by the Portuguese to Macau, where they were enslaved to Portuguese or became slaves to other slaves. Some Korean slaves were bought by the Portuguese and brought back to Portugal from Japan, where they had been among the tens of thousands of Korean prisoners of war transported to Japan during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98). Historians pointed out that at the same time Hideyoshi expressed his indignation and outrage at the Portuguese trade in Japanese slaves, he was engaging in a mass slave trade of Korean prisoners of war in Japan.
Fillippo Sassetti saw some Chinese and Japanese slaves in Lisbon among the large slave community in 1578, although most of the slaves were black.The Portuguese also valued Oriental slaves more than the black Africans and the Moors for their rarity. Chinese slaves were more expensive than Moors and blacks and showed off the high status of the owner. The Portuguese attributed qualities like intelligence and industriousness to Chinese, Japanese and Indian slaves. King Sebastian of Portugal feared rampant slavery was having a negative effect on Catholic proselytization, so he commanded that it be banned in 1571. Hideyoshi was so disgusted that his own Japanese people were being sold en masse into slavery on Kyushu, that he wrote a letter to Jesuit Vice-Provincial Gaspar Coelho on July 24, 1587, to demand the Portuguese, Siamese (Thai), and Cambodians stop purchasing and enslaving Japanese and return Japanese slaves who ended up as far as India. Hideyoshi blamed the Portuguese and Jesuits for this slave trade and banned Christian proselytizing as a result. In 1595, a law was passed by Portugal banning the selling and buying of Chinese and Japanese slaves.


==== South Asia ====
Slavery in India was widespread by the 6th century BC, and perhaps even as far back as the Vedic period. Slavery intensified during the Muslim domination of northern India after the 11th-century. Slavery existed in Portuguese India after the 16th century. The Dutch, too, largely dealt in Abyssian slaves, known in India as Habshis or Sheedes. Arakan/Bengal, Malabar, and Coromandel remained the largest sources of forced labour until the 1660s.
Between 1626 and 1662, the Dutch exported on an average 150–400 slaves annually from the Arakan-Bengal coast. During the first 30 years of Batavia's existence, Indian and Arakanese slaves provided the main labour force of the Dutch East India Company, Asian headquarters. An increase in Coromandel slaves occurred during a famine following the revolt of the Nayaka Indian rulers of South India (Tanjavur, Senji, and Madurai) against Bijapur overlordship (1645) and the subsequent devastation of the Tanjavur countryside by the Bijapur army. Reportedly, more than 150,000 people were taken by the invading Deccani Muslim armies to Bijapur and Golconda. In 1646, 2,118 slaves were exported to Batavia, the overwhelming majority from southern Coromandel. Some slaves were also acquired further south at Tondi, Adirampatnam, and Kayalpatnam. Another increase in slaving took place between 1659 and 1661 from Tanjavur as a result of a series of successive Bijapuri raids. At Nagapatnam, Pulicat, and elsewhere, the company purchased 8,000–10,000 slaves, the bulk of whom were sent to Ceylon, while a small portion were exported to Batavia and Malacca. Finally, following a long drought in Madurai and southern Coromandel, in 1673, which intensified the prolonged Madurai-Maratha struggle over Tanjavur and punitive fiscal practices, thousands of people from Tanjavur, mostly children, were sold into slavery and exported by Asian traders from Nagapattinam to Aceh, Johor, and other slave markets.
In September 1687, 665 slaves were exported by the English from Fort St. George, Madras. And, in 1694–96, when warfare once more ravaged South India, a total of 3,859 slaves were imported from Coromandel by private individuals into Ceylon. The volume of the total Dutch Indian Ocean slave trade has been estimated to be about 15–30% of the Atlantic slave trade, slightly smaller than the trans-Saharan slave trade, and one-and-a-half to three times the size of the Swahili and Red Sea coast and the Dutch West India Company slave trades.According to Sir Henry Bartle Frere (who sat on the Viceroy's Council), there were an estimated 8 or 9 million slaves in India in 1841. About 15% of the population of Malabar were slaves. Slavery was legally abolished in the possessions of the East India Company by the Indian Slavery Act, 1843.


==== South East Asia ====
The hill tribe people in Indochina were ""hunted incessantly and carried off as slaves by the Siamese (Thai), the Anamites (Vietnamese), and the Cambodians"". A Siamese military campaign in Laos in 1876 was described by a British observer as having been ""transformed into slave-hunting raids on a large scale"". The census, taken in 1879, showed that 6% of the population in the Malay sultanate of Perak were slaves. Enslaved people made up about two-thirds of the population in part of North Borneo in the 1880s.


==== Oceania ====
Slaves (he mōkai) had a recognised social role in traditional Māori society in New Zealand.Blackbirding occurred on islands in the Pacific Ocean and Australia, especially in the 19th century.


=== Europe ===


==== Ancient Greece and Rome ====

Records of slavery in Ancient Greece begin with Mycenaean Greece. Classical Athens had the largest slave population, with as many as 80,000 in the 6th and 5th centuries BC. As the Roman Republic expanded outward, entire populations were enslaved, across Europe and the Mediterranean. Slaves were used for labour, as well as for amusement (e.g., gladiators and sex slaves). This oppression by an elite minority eventually led to slave revolts (see Roman Servile Wars); the Third Servile War was led by Spartacus.

By the late Republican era, slavery had become an economic pillar of Roman wealth, as well as Roman society. It is estimated that 25% or more of the population of Ancient Rome was enslaved, although the actual percentage is debated by scholars and varied from region to region. Slaves represented 15–25% of Italy's population, mostly war captives, especially from Gaul and Epirus. Estimates of the number of slaves in the Roman Empire suggest that the majority were scattered throughout the provinces outside of Italy. Generally, slaves in Italy were indigenous Italians. Foreigners (including both slaves and freedmen) born outside of Italy were estimated to have peaked at 5% of the total in the capital, where their number was largest. Those from outside of Europe were predominantly of Greek descent. Jewish slaves never fully assimilated into Roman society, remaining an identifiable minority. These slaves (especially the foreigners) had higher death rates and lower birth rates than natives and were sometimes subjected to mass expulsions. The average recorded age at death for the slaves in Rome was seventeen and a half years (17.2 for males; 17.9 for females).


==== Medieval Europe ====

Slavery in early medieval Europe was so common that the Catholic Church repeatedly prohibited it, or at least the export of Christian slaves to non-Christian lands, as for example at the Council of Koblenz (922), the Council of London (1102) (which aimed mainly at the sale of English slaves to Ireland) and the Council of Armagh (1171). Serfdom, on the contrary, was widely accepted. In 1452, Pope Nicholas V issued the papal bull Dum Diversas, granting the kings of Spain and Portugal the right to reduce any ""Saracens (Muslims), pagans and any other unbelievers"" to perpetual slavery, legitimizing the slave trade as a result of war. The approval of slavery under these conditions was reaffirmed and extended in his Romanus Pontifex bull of 1455. Large-scale trading in slaves was mainly confined to the South and East of early medieval Europe: the Byzantine Empire and the Muslim world were the destinations, while pagan Central and Eastern Europe (along with the Caucasus and Tartary) were important sources. Viking, Arab, Greek, and Radhanite Jewish merchants were all involved in the slave trade during the Early Middle Ages. The trade in European slaves reached a peak in the 10th century following the Zanj Rebellion which dampened the use of African slaves in the Arab world.In Britain, slavery continued to be practiced following the fall of Rome, while sections of Æthelstan's and Hywel the Good's laws dealt with slaves in medieval England and medieval Wales respectively. The trade particularly picked up after the Viking invasions, with major markets at Chester and Bristol supplied by Danish, Mercian, and Welsh raiding of one another's borderlands. At the time of the Domesday Book, nearly 10% of the English population were slaves. William the Conqueror introduced a law preventing the sale of slaves overseas. According to historian John Gillingham, by 1200 slavery in the British Isles was non-existent. Slavery had never been authorized by statute within England and Wales, and in 1772, in the case Somerset v Stewart, Lord Mansfield declared that it was also unsupported within England by the common law. The slave trade was abolished by the Slave Trade Act 1807, although slavery remained legal in possessions outside Europe until the passage of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 and the Indian Slavery Act, 1843. However, when England began to have colonies in the Americas, and particularly from the 1640s, African slaves began to make their appearance in England and remained a presence until the eighteenth century. In Scotland, slaves continued to be sold as chattels until late in the eighteenth century (on the second May 1722, an advertisement appeared in the Edinburgh Evening Courant, announcing that a stolen slave had been found, who would be sold to pay expenses, unless claimed within two weeks). For nearly two hundred years in the history of coal mining in Scotland, miners were bonded to their ""maisters"" by a 1606 Act ""Anent Coalyers and Salters"". The Colliers and Salters (Scotland) Act 1775 stated that ""many colliers and salters are in a state of slavery and bondage"" and announced emancipation; those starting work after July 1, 1775, would not become slaves, while those already in a state of slavery could, after 7 or 10 years depending on their age, apply for a decree of the Sheriff's Court granting their freedom. Few could afford this, until a further law in 1799 established their freedom and made this slavery and bondage illegal.
The Byzantine-Ottoman wars and the Ottoman wars in Europe brought large numbers of slaves into the Islamic world. To staff its bureaucracy, the Ottoman Empire established a janissary system which seized hundreds of thousands of Christian boys through the devşirme system. They were well cared for but were legally slaves owned by the government and were not allowed to marry. They were never bought or sold. The empire gave them significant administrative and military roles. The system began about 1365; there were 135,000 janissaries in 1826, when the system ended. After the Battle of Lepanto, 12,000 Christian galley slaves were recaptured and freed from the Ottoman fleet. Eastern Europe suffered a series of Tatar invasions, the goal of which was to loot and capture slaves for selling them to Ottomans as jasyr. Seventy-five Crimean Tatar raids were recorded into Poland–Lithuania between 1474 and 1569.
Medieval Spain and Portugal were the scene of almost constant Muslim invasion of the predominantly Christian area. Periodic raiding expeditions were sent from Al-Andalus to ravage the Iberian Christian kingdoms, bringing back booty and slaves. In a raid against Lisbon in 1189, for example, the Almohad caliph Yaqub al-Mansur took 3,000 female and child captives, while his governor of Córdoba, in a subsequent attack upon Silves, Portugal, in 1191, took 3,000 Christian slaves. From the 11th to the 19th century, North African Barbary Pirates engaged in raids on European coastal towns to capture Christian slaves to sell at slave markets in places such as Algeria and Morocco.The maritime town of Lagos was the first slave market created in Portugal (one of the earliest colonizers of the Americas) for the sale of imported African slaves – the Mercado de Escravos, opened in 1444. In 1441, the first slaves were brought to Portugal from northern Mauritania. By 1552, black African slaves made up 10% of the population of Lisbon. In the second half of the 16th century, the Crown gave up the monopoly on slave trade, and the focus of European trade in African slaves shifted from import to Europe to slave transports directly to tropical colonies in the Americas – especially Brazil. In the 15th century one-third of the slaves were resold to the African market in exchange of gold.
Until the late 18th century, the Crimean Khanate (a Muslim Tatar state) maintained a massive slave trade with the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East. The slaves were captured in southern Russia, Poland-Lithuania, Moldavia, Wallachia, and Circassia by Tatar horsemen and sold in the Crimean port of Kaffa. About 2 million mostly Christian slaves were exported over the 16th and 17th centuries until the Crimean Khanate was destroyed by the Russian Empire in 1783. In Kievan Rus and Muscovy, slaves were usually classified as kholops. According to David P. Forsythe, ""In 1649 up to three-quarters of Muscovy's peasants, or 13 to 14 million people, were serfs whose material lives were barely distinguishable from slaves. Perhaps another 1.5 million were formally enslaved, with Russian slaves serving Russian masters."" Slavery remained a major institution in Russia until 1723, when Peter the Great converted the household slaves into house serfs. Russian agricultural slaves were formally converted into serfs earlier in 1679. Slavery in Poland was forbidden in the 15th century; in Lithuania, slavery was formally abolished in 1588; they were replaced by the second serfdom.
In Scandinavia, thralldom was abolished in the mid-14th century.


==== World War II ====

During the Second World War, Nazi Germany effectively enslaved about 12 million people, both those considered undesirable and citizens of conquered countries, with the avowed intention of treating these Untermenschen (sub-humans) as a permanent slave-class of inferior beings who could be worked until they died, and who possessed neither the rights nor the legal status of members of the Aryan race.Besides Jews, the harshest deportation and forced labour policies were applied to the populations of Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia. By the end of the war, half of Belarus' population had been killed or deported.


==== Communist states ====

Between 1930 and 1960, the Soviet Union created a system of, according to Anne Applebaum and the ""perspective of the Kremlin"", slave labor camps called the Gulag (Russian: ГУЛаг, romanized: GULag).Prisoners in these camps were worked to death by a combination of extreme production quotas, physical and psychological brutality, hunger, lack of medical care, and the harsh environment. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, who survived eight years of Gulag incarceration, provided firsthand testimony about the camps with the publication of The Gulag Archipelago, after which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. Fatality rate was as high as 80% during the first months in many camps. Hundreds of thousands of people, possibly millions, died as a direct result of forced labour under the Soviets.Golfo Alexopoulos suggests comparing labor in the Gulag with ""other forms of slave labor"" and notes its ""violence of human exploitation"" in Illness and Inhumanity in Stalin's Gulag:

Stalin's Gulag was, in many ways, less a concentration camp than a forced labor camp and less a prison system than a system of slavery. The image of the slave appears often in Gulag memoir literature. As Varlam Shalamov wrote: ""Hungry and exhausted, we leaned into a horse collar, raising blood blisters on our chests and pulling a stone-filled cart up the slanted mine floor. The collar was the same device used long ago by the ancient Egyptians."" Thoughtful and rigorous historical comparisons of Soviet forced labor and other forms of slave labor would be worthy of scholarly attention, in my view. For as in the case of global slavery, the Gulag found legitimacy in an elaborate narrative of difference that involved the presumption of dangerousness and guilt. This ideology of difference and the violence of human exploitation have left lasting legacies in contemporary Russia.

Historian Anne Applebaum writes in the introduction of her book that the word GULAG has come to represent ""the system of Soviet slave labor itself, in all its forms and varieties"":

The word ""GULAG"" is an acronym for Glavnoe Upravlenie Lagerei, or Main Camp Administration, the institution which ran the Soviet camps. But over time, the word has also come to signify the system of Soviet slave labor itself, in all its forms and varieties: labor camps, punishment camps, criminal and political camps, women's camps, children's camps, transit camps. Even more broadly, ""Gulag"" has come to mean the Soviet repressive system itself, the set of procedures that Alexander Solzhenitsyn once called ""our meat grinder"": the arrests, the interrogations, the transport in unheated cattle cars, the forced labor, the destruction of families, the years spent in exile, the early and unnecessary deaths.

Applebaum's introduction has been criticized by Gulag researcher Wilson Bell, stating that her book ""is, aside from the introduction, a well-done overview of the Gulag, but it did not offer an interpretative framework much beyond Solzhenitsyn's paradigms"".


=== Middle East ===

In the earliest known records, slavery is treated as an established institution. The Code of Hammurabi (c. 1760 BC), for example, prescribed death for anyone who helped a slave escape or who sheltered a fugitive. The Bible mentions slavery as an established institution. Slavery existed in Pharaonic Egypt, but studying it is complicated by terminology used by the Egyptians to refer to different classes of servitude over the course of history. Interpretation of the textual evidence of classes of slaves in ancient Egypt has been difficult to differentiate by word usage alone. The three apparent types of enslavement in Ancient Egypt: chattel slavery, bonded labour, and forced labour.As recently as the early 1960s, Saudi Arabia's slave population was estimated at 300,000. Along with Yemen, the Saudis abolished slavery in 1962. Historically, slaves in the Arab World came from many different regions, including Sub-Saharan Africa (mainly Zanj), the Caucasus (mainly Circassians), Central Asia (mainly Tartars), and Central and Eastern Europe (mainly Slavs Saqaliba).
In Constantinople, about one-fifth of the population consisted of slaves. The city was a major centre of the slave trade in the 15th and later centuries.
Slaves were provided by Tatar raids on Slavic villages but also by conquest and the suppression of rebellions, in the aftermath of which entire populations were sometimes enslaved and sold across the Empire, reducing the risk of future rebellion. The Ottomans also purchased slaves from traders who brought slaves into the Empire from Europe and Africa. It has been estimated that some 200,000 slaves – mainly Circassians – were imported into the Ottoman Empire between 1800 and 1909. In 1908, women slaves were still sold in the Ottoman Empire. German orientalist, Gustaf Dalman, reported seeing slaves in Muslim houses in Aleppo, belonging to Ottoman Syria, in 1899, and that boys could be bought as slaves in Damascus and Cairo in as late as 1909.
A slave market for captured Russian and Persian slaves was centred in the Central Asian khanate of Khiva. In the early 1840s, the population of the Uzbek states of Bukhara and Khiva included about 900,000 slaves.


== Contemporary slavery ==

Even though slavery is now outlawed in every country, the number of slaves today is estimated as between 12 million and 29.8 million. According to a broad definition of slavery, there were 27 million people in slavery in 1999, spread all over the world. In 2005, the International Labour Organization provided an estimate of 12.3 million forced labourers. Siddharth Kara has also provided an estimate of 28.4 million slaves at the end of 2006 divided into three categories: bonded labour/debt bondage (18.1 million), forced labour (7.6 million), and trafficked slaves (2.7 million). Kara provides a dynamic model to calculate the number of slaves in the world each year, with an estimated 29.2 million at the end of 2009.

According to a 2003 report by Human Rights Watch, an estimated 15 million children in debt bondage in India work in slavery-like conditions to pay off their family's debts.Slavoj Žižek asserts that new forms of contemporary slavery have been created in the post-Cold War era of global capitalism, including migrant workers deprived of basic civil rights on the Arabian Peninsula, the total control of workers in Asian sweatshops and the use of forced labor in the exploitation of natural resources in Central Africa.


=== Distribution ===
In June 2013, U.S. State Department released a report on slavery. It placed Russia, China, and Uzbekistan in the worst offenders category. Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, and Zimbabwe were at the lowest level. The list also included Algeria, Libya, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait among a total of 21 countries.In Kuwait, there are more than 600,000 migrant domestic workers who are vulnerable to forced labor and legally tied to their employers, who often illegally take their passports. In 2019, online slave markets on apps such as Instagram were uncovered.In the preparations for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, thousands of Nepalese, the largest group of labourers, faced slavery in the form of denial of wages, confiscation of documents, and inability to leave the workplace. In 2016, the United Nations gave Qatar 12 months to end migrant worker slavery or face investigation.The Walk Free Foundation reported in 2018 that slavery in wealthy Western societies is much more prevalent than previously known, in particular the United States and Great Britain, which have 403,000 (one in 800) and 136,000 slaves respectively. Andrew Forrest, founder of the organization, said that ""The United States is one of the most advanced countries in the world yet has more than 400,000 modern slaves working under forced labour conditions."" An estimated 40.3 million are enslaved globally, with North Korea having the most slaves at 2.6 million (one in 10). Of the estimated 40.3 million people in contemporary slavery, 71% are women and 29% are men. The report found of the 40.3 million in modern slavery, 15.4 million are in forced marriages and 24.9 million are in forced labor. The foundation defines contemporary slavery as ""situations of exploitation that a person cannot refuse or leave because of threats, violence, coercion, abuse of power, or deception.""


==== China ====

The Chinese government has a history of imprisoning citizens for political reasons. Article 73 of China's Criminal Procedure Law was adopted in 2012 and allow the authorities to detain people for reasons of ""state security"" or ""terrorism"". In this regard, detainees can be held for as long as six months in ""designated locations"" such as secret prisons.In March 2020, the Chinese government was found to be using the Uyghur minority for forced labour, inside sweat shops. According to a report published then by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), no fewer than around 80,000 Uyghurs were forcibly removed from the region of Xinjiang and used for forced labour in at least twenty-seven corporate factories. According to the Business and Human Rights resource center, corporations such as Abercrombie & Fitch, Adidas, Amazon, Apple, BMW, Fila, Gap, H&M, Inditex, Marks & Spencer, Nike, North Face, Puma, PVH, Samsung, and UNIQLO have each sourced products from these factories prior to the publication of the ASPI report.


==== Libya ====
During the Second Libyan Civil War, Libyans started capturing Sub-Saharan African migrants trying to get to Europe through Libya and selling them on slave markets or holding them hostage for ransom Women are often raped, used as sex slaves, or sold to brothels. Child migrants suffer from abuse and child rape in Libya.


==== Mauritania ====
In Mauritania, the last country to abolish slavery (in 1981), it is estimated that 20% of its population of 3 million people are enslaved as bonded labourers. Slavery in Mauritania was criminalized in August 2007. However, although slavery, as a practice, was legally banned in 1981, it was not a crime to own a slave until 2007. Although many slaves have escaped or have been freed since 2007, as of 2012, only one slave owner had been sentenced to serve time in prison.


==== North Korea ====

North Korea's human rights record is often considered to be the worst in the world and has been globally condemned, with the United Nations, the European Union and groups such as Human Rights Watch all critical of the country's record. Forms of torture, forced labour, and abuses are all widespread. Most international human rights organizations consider North Korea to have no contemporary parallel with respect to violations of liberty.


=== Economics ===
While American slaves in 1809 were sold for around $40,000 (in inflation adjusted dollars), a slave nowadays can be bought for just $90, making replacement more economical than providing long-term care. Slavery is a multibillion-dollar industry with estimates of up to $35 billion generated annually.


=== Trafficking ===
Victims of human trafficking are typically recruited through deceit or trickery (such as a false job offer, false migration offer, or false marriage offer), sale by family members, recruitment by former slaves, or outright abduction. Victims are forced into a ""debt slavery"" situation by coercion, deception, fraud, intimidation, isolation, threat, physical force, debt bondage or even force-feeding with drugs to control their victims. ""Annually, according to U.S. government-sponsored research completed in 2006, approximately 800,000 people are trafficked across national borders, which does not include millions trafficked within their own countries. Approximately 80% of transnational victims are women and girls, and up to 50% are minors, reports the U.S. State Department in a 2008 study.While the majority of trafficking victims are women who are forced into prostitution (in which case the practice is called sex trafficking), victims also include men, women and children who are forced into manual labour. Because of the illegal nature of human trafficking, its extent is unknown. A U.S. government report, published in 2005, estimates that about 700,000 people worldwide are trafficked across borders each year. This figure does not include those who are trafficked internally. Another research effort revealed that roughly 1.5 million individuals are trafficked either internally or internationally each year, of which about 500,000 are sex trafficking victims.


== Abolitionism ==

Slavery has existed, in one form or another, throughout recorded human history – as have, in various periods, movements to free large or distinct groups of slaves.


=== In antiquity ===
Ashoka, who ruled the Maurya Empire in the Indian subcontinent from 269 to 232 BCE, abolished the slave trade but not slavery. The Qin dynasty, which ruled China from 221 to 206 BC, abolished slavery and discouraged serfdom. However, many of its laws were overturned when the dynasty was overthrown. Slavery was again abolished by Wang Mang in China in 17 CE but was reinstituted after his assassination.


=== Americas ===
The Spanish colonization of the Americas sparked a discussion about the right to enslave Native Americans. A prominent critic of slavery in the Spanish New World colonies was the Spanish missionary and bishop, Bartolomé de las Casas, who was ""the first to expose the oppression of indigenous peoples by Europeans in the Americas and to call for the abolition of slavery there.""In the United States, all of the northern states had abolished slavery by 1804, with New Jersey being the last to act. Abolitionist pressure produced a series of small steps towards emancipation. After the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves went into effect on January 1, 1808, the importation of slaves into the United States was prohibited, but not the internal slave trade, nor involvement in the international slave trade externally. Legal slavery persisted outside the northern states; most of those slaves already in the U.S. were legally emancipated only in 1863. Many American abolitionists took an active role in opposing slavery by supporting the Underground Railroad. Violent clashes between anti-slavery and pro-slavery Americans included Bleeding Kansas, a series of political and armed disputes in 1854–1858 as to whether Kansas would join the United States as a slave or free state. By 1860, the total number of slaves reached almost four million, and the American Civil War, beginning in 1861, led to the end of slavery in the United States. In 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed slaves held in the Confederate States; the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibited most forms of slavery throughout the country.
Many of the freed slaves became sharecroppers and indentured servants. In this manner, some became tied to the very parcel of land into which they had been born a slave having little freedom or economic opportunity because of Jim Crow laws which perpetuated discrimination, limited education, promoted persecution without due process and resulted in continued poverty. Fear of reprisals such as unjust incarcerations and lynchings deterred upward mobility further.


=== Europe ===
France abolished slavery in 1794 during the Revolution, but it was restored in 1802 under Napoleon. It has been asserted that, before the Revolution, slavery was illegal in metropolitan France (as opposed to its colonies), but this has been refuted.One of the most significant milestones in the campaign to abolish slavery throughout the world occurred in England in 1772, with British Judge Lord Mansfield, whose opinion in Somersett's Case was widely taken to have held that slavery was illegal in England. This judgement also laid down the principle that slavery contracted in other jurisdictions could not be enforced in England.Sons of Africa was a late 18th-century British group that campaigned to end slavery. Its members were Africans in London, freed slaves who included Ottobah Cugoano, Olaudah Equiano and other leading members of London's black community. It was closely connected to the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade, a non-denominational group founded in 1787, whose members included Thomas Clarkson. British Member of Parliament William Wilberforce led the anti-slavery movement in the United Kingdom, although the groundwork was an anti-slavery essay by Clarkson. Wilberforce was urged by his close friend, Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger, to make the issue his own and was also given support by reformed Evangelical John Newton. The Slave Trade Act was passed by the British Parliament on March 25, 1807, making the slave trade illegal throughout the British Empire, Wilberforce also campaigned for abolition of slavery in the British Empire, which he lived to see in the Slavery Abolition Act 1833.
After the 1807 act abolishing the slave trade was passed, these campaigners switched to encouraging other countries to follow suit, notably France and the British colonies. Between 1808 and 1860, the British West Africa Squadron seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard. Action was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade, for example against ""the usurping King of Lagos"", deposed in 1851. Anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 African rulers.


=== Worldwide ===
In 1839, the world's oldest international human rights organization, Anti-Slavery International, was formed in Britain by Joseph Sturge, which campaigned to outlaw slavery in other countries. There were celebrations in 2007 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade in the United Kingdom through the work of the British Anti-Slavery Society.
In the 1860s, David Livingstone's reports of atrocities within the Arab slave trade in Africa stirred up the interest of the British public, reviving the flagging abolitionist movement. The Royal Navy throughout the 1870s attempted to suppress ""this abominable Eastern trade"", at Zanzibar in particular. In 1905, the French abolished indigenous slavery in most of French West Africa.On December 10, 1948, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which declared freedom from slavery is an internationally recognized human right. Article 4 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states:

No one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms.
In 2014, for the first time in history, major leaders of many religions, Buddhist, Hindu, Christian, Jewish, and Muslim met to sign a shared commitment against modern-day slavery; the declaration they signed calls for the elimination of slavery and human trafficking by 2020. The signatories were: Pope Francis, Mātā Amṛtānandamayī, Bhikkhuni Thich Nu Chân Không (representing Zen Master Thích Nhất Hạnh), Datuk K Sri Dhammaratana, Chief High Priest of Malaysia, Rabbi Abraham Skorka, Rabbi David Rosen, Abbas Abdalla Abbas Soliman, Undersecretary of State of Al Azhar Alsharif (representing Mohamed Ahmed El-Tayeb, Grand Imam of Al-Azhar), Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi, Sheikh Naziyah Razzaq Jaafar, Special advisor of Grand Ayatollah (representing Grand Ayatollah Sheikh Basheer Hussain al Najafi), Sheikh Omar Abboud, Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Metropolitan Emmanuel of France (representing Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew.)Groups such as the American Anti-Slavery Group, Anti-Slavery International, Free the Slaves, the Anti-Slavery Society, and the Norwegian Anti-Slavery Society continue to campaign to eliminate slavery.UNESCO has been working to break the silence surrounding the memory of slavery since 1994, through The Slave Route Project.


== Apologies ==
On May 21, 2001, the National Assembly of France passed the Taubira law, recognizing slavery as a crime against humanity. Apologies on behalf of African nations, for their role in trading their countrymen into slavery, remain an open issue since slavery was practiced in Africa even before the first Europeans arrived and the Atlantic slave trade was performed with a high degree of involvement of several African societies. The black slave market was supplied by well-established slave trade networks controlled by local African societies and individuals.
There is adequate evidence citing case after case of African control of segments of the trade. Several African nations such as the Calabar and other southern parts of Nigeria had economies depended solely on the trade. African peoples such as the Imbangala of Angola and the Nyamwezi of Tanzania would serve as middlemen or roving bands warring with other African nations to capture Africans for Europeans.
Several historians have made important contributions to the global understanding of the African side of the Atlantic slave trade. By arguing that African merchants determined the assemblage of trade goods accepted in exchange for slaves, many historians argue for African agency and ultimately a shared responsibility for the slave trade.In 1999, President Mathieu Kérékou of Benin issued a national apology for the central role Africans played in the Atlantic slave trade. Luc Gnacadja, minister of environment and housing for Benin, later said: ""The slave trade is a shame, and we do repent for it."" Researchers estimate that 3 million slaves were exported out of the Slave Coast bordering the Bight of Benin. President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana also apologized for his country's involvement in the slave trade.The issue of an apology is linked to reparations for slavery and is still being pursued by entities across the world. For example, the Jamaican Reparations Movement approved its declaration and action plan. In 2007, British Prime Minister Tony Blair made a formal apology for Great Britain's involvement in slavery.On February 25, 2007, the Commonwealth of Virginia resolved to 'profoundly regret' and apologize for its role in the institution of slavery. Unique and the first of its kind in the U.S., the apology was unanimously passed in both Houses as Virginia approached the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown.On August 24, 2007, Mayor of London Ken Livingstone issued a public apology for London's role in Atlantic slave trade, which took place at an event commemorating the 200th anniversary of the British slave trade's abolition. In his speech, Livingstone described the slave trade as ""the racial murder of not just those who were transported but generations of enslaved African men, women and children. To justify this murder and torture black people had to be declared inferior or not human... We live with the consequences today."" City officials in Liverpool, which was a large slave trading port, apologized in 1999.On July 30, 2008, the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution apologizing for American slavery and subsequent discriminatory laws. In June 2009, the U.S. Senate passed a resolution apologizing to African-Americans for the ""fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality, and inhumanity of slavery"". The news was welcomed by President Barack Obama, the nation's first president of African descent. Some of President Obama's ancestors may have been slave owners.In 2010, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi apologized for Arab involvement in the slave trade, saying: ""I regret the behavior of the Arabs... They brought African children to North Africa, they made them slaves, they sold them like animals, and they took them as slaves and traded them in a shameful way.""


=== Reparations ===

There have been movements to achieve reparations for those formerly held as slaves or for their descendants. Claims for reparations for being held in slavery are handled as a civil law matter in almost every country. This is often decried as a serious problem, since former slaves' relatives lack of money means they often have limited access to a potentially expensive and futile legal process. Mandatory systems of fines and reparations paid to an as yet undetermined group of claimants from fines, paid by unspecified parties, and collected by authorities have been proposed by advocates to alleviate this ""civil court problem."" Since in almost all cases there are no living ex-slaves or living ex-slave owners these movements have gained little traction. In nearly all cases the judicial system has ruled that the statute of limitations on these possible claims has long since expired.
In June 2023, The Brattle Group presented a report at an event at the University of the West Indies in which reparations were estimated, for harms both during and after the period of transatlantic chattel slavery, at over 100 trillion dollars.


== Media ==

Film has been the most influential medium in the presentation of the history of slavery to the general public around the world. The American film industry has had a complex relationship with slavery and until recent decades often avoided the topic. Films such as The Birth of a Nation (1915) and Gone with the Wind (1939) became controversial because they gave a favourable depiction. In 1940 The Santa Fe Trail gave a liberal but ambiguous interpretation of John Brown's attacks on slavery. Song of the South gave a favorable outlook on slavery in the United States in 1946.
The Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s made defiant slaves into heroes. The question of slavery in American memory necessarily involves its depictions in feature films.Most Hollywood films used American settings, although Spartacus (1960), dealt with an actual revolt in the Roman Empire known as the Third Servile War. The revolt failed, and all the rebels were executed, but their spirit lived on according to the film. Spartacus stays surprisingly close to the historical record.The Last Supper (La última cena in Spanish) was a 1976 film directed by Cuban Tomás Gutiérrez Alea about the teaching of Christianity to slaves in Cuba, and emphasizes the role of ritual and revolt. Burn! takes place on the imaginary Portuguese island of Queimada (where the locals speak Spanish) and it merges historical events that took place in Brazil, Cuba, Santo Domingo, Jamaica, and elsewhere.
Historians agree that films have largely shaped historical memories, but they debate issues of accuracy, plausibility, moralism, sensationalism, how facts are stretched in search of broader truths, and suitability for the classroom. Berlin argues that critics complain if the treatment emphasizes historical brutality, or if it glosses over the harshness to highlight the emotional impact of slavery.

What is Modern Slavery?; Office To Monitor And Combat Trafficking In Persons, U.S. Department of State.","Slavery is the ownership of a person as property, especially in regards to their labor. Slavery typically involves compulsory work with the slave's location of work and residence dictated by the party that holds them in bondage. Enslavement is the placement of a person into slavery, and the person is called a slave or an enslaved person (see

Auricularia nigricans,"Auricularia nigricans  is a species of fungus in the family Auriculariaceae. Basidiocarps (fruitbodies} are gelatinous, ear-like, and grow on dead wood of broadleaf trees. It is an American species, known from Louisiana and the Caribbean south to Argentina, and was formerly confused with the similar Asian species Auricularia polytricha, originally described from India.


== Taxonomy ==
The species was first described in 1788 as Peziza nigrescens by the Swedish botanist Olof Swartz, based on a collection he made from Jamaica. In a later publication he changed the name to Peziza nigricans, which was accepted by the Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries. For abstruse nomenclatural reasons, Fries's sanctioned name takes priority over Swartz's original name. In his monograph of Auricularia species, American mycologist Bernard Lowy rejected the name as being ""doubtful"", preferring to call the species Auricularia polytricha. Olof Swartz's original collection still exists, however, enabling the identity of his species to be confirmed. Molecular research, based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences, has shown that Auricularia nigricans is distinct.


== Description ==
Auricularia nigricans forms thin, rubbery-gelatinous fruit bodies that are ear-shaped and up to 60 mm (2.4 in) across and 4 mm (0.16 in) thick. The fruitbodies occur singly or in clusters. The upper surface is densely tomentose and ash-grey to yellowish brown. The spore-bearing underside is smooth and pinkish to brown.


=== Microscopic characters ===
The microscopic characters are typical of the genus Auricularia. The basidia are tubular, laterally septate, 50–75 × 3-6.5 µm. The spores are allantoid (sausage-shaped), 14.5–17 × 5–7 µm. The surface hairs are 650–1080 µm long.


=== Similar species ===
Auricularia cornea is similar but has much shorter surface hairs 200–400 µm long.


== Habitat and distribution ==
Auricularia nigricans is a wood-rotting species, typically found on dead attached or fallen wood of broadleaf trees. It is widely distributed in the Americas, from Louisiana and the Caribbean south to Argentina, but is not currently known elsewhere.

Jack Snelling,"John James ""Jack"" Snelling (born 8 November 1972) is a former Australian politician. He was the Labor member for the South Australian House of Assembly seat of Playford from the 1997 election until his retirement in 2018. Snelling left the Labor Party in 2021 to found the Family First Party.


== Background ==
Prior to his election into politics, Snelling was an electoral officer, and a staffer in the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA). Snelling was a supporter of the work of Christopher Pearson.


== Parliament ==
Entering parliament in 1997 at the age of 24, he was the youngest member of the House of Assembly at the time. He was Speaker of the South Australian House of Assembly for the Rann Labor government from 2006 to 2010. He also served as Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees. He is aligned with Labor's right faction.A consequence of the major 2016 electoral redistribution was that two thirds of the voters in Snelling's electorate of Playford will be moved to Florey. On 15 March 2017 he won Labor preselection to be the candidate for Florey at the 2018 election. The incumbent member for Florey, Frances Bedford, had also nominated for pre-selection. On 28 March 2017, Bedford resigned from the party after they endorsed Snelling for the seat. A ReachTEL poll conducted on 2 March 2017 of 606 voters in post-redistribution Florey indicated a 33.4 percent primary vote for Bedford running as an independent which would likely see Snelling defeated after preferences. Snelling withdrew from the pre-selection on 17 September 2017.

State of charge,"State of charge (SoC) is the level of charge of an electric battery relative to its capacity. SoC is usually expressed as percentage (0% = empty; 100% = full). An alternative form of the same measure is the depth of discharge (DoD), calculated as 100 - SoC (100% = empty; 0% = full). SoC is normally used when discussing the current state of a battery in use, while DoD is most often seen when discussing the lifetime of the battery after repeated use.


== In electric vehicles ==
In a battery electric vehicle (BEV), SoC for the battery pack is the equivalent of a fuel gauge.
It is important to mention that state of charge, presented as a gauge or percentage value on any vehicle dashboard, especially in plug-in hybrid vehicles, may not be representative of a real level of charge. In that particular case, some noticeable amount of energy stored in the electric battery is not shown on the dashboard, and is reserved for hybrid-work operations.  It permits a vehicle to accelerate with electric motors mainly using battery energy, while the petrol engine serves as a generator and recharges the battery to the minimum level needed for such operation. Examples of such cars are Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV (all versions/years of production), where 0% of the state of charge presented to the driver is a real 20-22% of charge level (assuming zero level as the lowest level of charge permitted by car producer). Another one is BMW i3 REX (Range Extender version), where about 6% of SOC is reserved for PHEV-alike operations. Tesla has stated that their SoC should be less than 95%, with some commentators saying between 30%-80% Archived 2021-01-11 at the Wayback Machine. There is some data to back this up as well.The state of charge (SOC) can help to reduce electrical car's owners' anxiety when they are waiting in the line or stay at home since it will reflect the progress of charging and let owners know when it will be ready.


== Determining SoC ==
Usually, SoC cannot be measured directly but it can be estimated from direct measurement variables in two ways: offline and online. In offline techniques, the
battery desires to be charged and discharged in constant rate such as Coulomb-counting. This method gives precise estimation of battery SoC, but they are protracted, costly, and interrupt main battery performance. Therefore, researchers are looking for some online techniques. In general there are five methods to determine SoC indirectly:
chemical
voltage
current integration
Kalman filtering
pressure


=== Chemical method ===
This method works only with batteries that offer access to their liquid electrolyte, such as non-sealed lead acid batteries. The specific gravity of the electrolyte can be used to indicate the SoC of the battery.
Hydrometers are used to calculate the specific gravity of a battery. To find specific gravity, it is necessary to measure out volume of the electrolyte and to weigh it. Then specific gravity is given by (mass of electrolyte [g]/ volume of electrolyte [ml])/ (Density of Water, i.e. 1g/1ml). To find SoC from specific gravity, a look-up table of SG vs SoC is needed.
More recently immersion refractometry has been shown to be a viable method for continuous monitoring of the state of charge. The refractive index of the battery electrolyte is directly relatable to the specific gravity or density of the electrolyte of the cell. Sensors, vol.22, no.1, p. 10, January 2005, US patent 10,145,789.


=== Voltage method ===
This method converts a reading of the battery voltage to SoC, using the known discharge curve (voltage vs. SoC) of the battery. However, the voltage is more significantly affected by the battery current (due to the battery's electrochemical kinetics) and temperature. This method can be made more accurate by compensating the voltage reading by a correction term proportional to the battery current, and by using a look-up table of battery's open circuit voltage vs. temperature.
In fact, it is a stated goal of battery design to provide a voltage as constant as possible no matter the SoC, which makes this method difficult to apply.


=== Current integration method ===
This method, also known as ""Coulomb counting"", calculates the SoC by measuring the battery current and integrating it in time.
Since no measurement can be perfect, this method suffers from long-term drift and lack of a reference point: therefore, the SoC must be re-calibrated on a regular basis, such as by resetting the SoC to 100% when a charger determines that the battery is fully charged (using one of the other methods described here).


=== Combined approaches ===
Maxim Integrated touts a combined voltage and charge approach that is claimed superior to either method alone; it is implemented in their ModelGauge m3 series of chips, such as MAX17050, which is used in the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 Android devices, for example.


=== Kalman filtering ===
To overcome the shortcomings of the voltage method and the current integration method, a Kalman filter can be used. The battery can be modeled with an electrical model which the Kalman filter will use to predict the over-voltage, due to the current. In combination with coulomb counting, it can make an accurate estimation of the state of charge. The strength of a Kalman filter is that it is able to adjust its trust of the battery voltage and coulomb counting in real time.


=== Pressure method ===
This method can be used with certain NiMH batteries, whose internal pressure increases rapidly when the battery is charged. More commonly, a pressure switch indicates if the battery is fully charged. This method may be improved by taking into account Peukert's law which is a function of charge/discharge current.

Geoff Moore,"Geoff Moore (born February 22, 1961) is an American contemporary Christian music singer. He began recording as a solo artist in 1984. In 1987, he formed Geoff Moore and The Distance, his touring band, which released eight albums generating a string of No. 1 radio hits throughout their 10+-year tenure. In 1998, Geoff retired the band from full-time touring. After a ""farewell tour"", Moore has continued as a solo artist, releasing eight more records between 1999 and 2015. The Next Thing was released in April 2016, making it his 25th album to date.
Geoff is also an advocate for underprivileged children. He has partnered with Compassion International since 1985, being a spokesman and advocate for their work in releasing children from poverty throughout the developing world. He also works with Showhope, an organization founded by his close friends Steven and Mary Beth Chapman. Showhope cares for orphan children and helps assist with international adoptions.
Geoff Moore is co-founder of an outdoor adventure company called Fellowship Adventures. Founded in 2014, Fellowship Adventures focuses on small group hunting, fishing, adventure and expeditions.


== Early years ==
Moore was born in Flint, Michigan in 1961. His father played baseball for the Toledo Mud Hens, and later ran a steel fabrication plant. He attended Holly Area Schools at Patterson Elementary, Holly, MI through grade six and then started attending Brandon Schools in Ortonville, MI. He began singing while he was at Taylor University living in Wengatz Hall. At the time that he became a classmate to White Hearts future lead singer, Rick Florian, when he stood in for the lead singer of his roommate's band. He graduated from Taylor in 1983. Newly married, he moved to Nashville soon after college. He was able to break into the music industry with the assistance of Michael W. Smith when the two met in the clothing store where Moore worked. He signed a publishing contract with Paragon Music, and began writing songs and singing on demo recordings. While with Paragon he wrote songs for fellow Christian singer and songwriter, Steven Curtis Chapman. Since that time, they have become best friends and have co-written numerous songs together, including the title track on Chapman's 1992 Dove Award and Grammy winning release The Great Adventure.
During the mid-1980s, Moore recorded three solo albums released on the Power Discs label, including Where are the Other Nine?, Over the Edge and The Distance. After signing to Sparrow Records in 1987, he put together a touring band, called ""the Distance"", to continue with his career.


== Geoff Moore and the Distance ==
In 1988, Geoff Moore and the Distance released their first official album together, entitled A Place to Stand. They also recorded Foundations in 1989 for Sparrow Records. After a year of touring, they jumped to Forefront Records and recorded Pure and Simple in 1990.
They followed in 1992 with A Friend Like U. This album would garner them their first real US Christian radio exposure with its title song. This started their most prolific period with the Grammy-nominated albums Ev-O-Lu-Tion in 1993 and Homerun in 1995. This album produced US Christian radio hits like ""Evolution Redefined"", ""Life Together"" and ""Home Run"". The video for ""Home Run"" featured former Major League All-Star pitcher Tim Burke.
In 1995, Benson released a compilation of hits from Moore's first solo albums titled The Early Years. The following year the band released a double-disc greatest hits compilation which contained new unreleased bonus tracks as well as a live performance from Rome, Georgia. In 1997, the band released Threads, another Grammy-nominated album which featured a cover of The Who's ""I'm Free"" as its lead single. After more than ten years with the Distance, which he called ""an incredible journey"" in the Star Tribune, Moore decided to disband the group and go his own way in 1998. In 1999 Moore returned to the studio to begin work on a new solo record. This began a new season of his music career which is still active today.
The Distance members were:

Roscoe Meek – guitar (1990–1995)
Guy Platter – guitar (1993–1994)
Dale Oliver – guitar (1987–1989)
Lang Bliss – drums (1987–1989)
Arlin Troyer – bass guitar (1987–1990)
Geof Barkley – keyboards, vocals (1988–1998)
Gary Mullett – bass guitar (1990–1998)
Greg Herrington – drums (1990–1994)
Chuck Conner – drums (1995–1998)
Joel McCreight – guitar (1996–1998)


== Solo career ==
In 1999, after a short time off, Moore emerged with his eponymous solo album on Forefront Records. In 2002 he followed it up with A Beautiful Sound. Near the end of 2005 he released two new studio albums independently, Every Single One Part I and Every Single One Part II,. The albums combined original songs and re-recorded selections from the out of print Forefront Records albums with The Distance.
Moore's next project Speak to Me, released in 2007 on Rocketown Records was nominated for a Dove Award for Inspirational Album of the Year. After putting together All Along the Road Part I and All Along the Road Part II, a re-release of Every Single One with alternate tracks, Moore released Saying Grace, a collection of songs that reflect back to his upbringing, expressing ""gratefulness"" for family, for tradition, and grace in the midst of uncertainty. In 2013, Moore compiled 25 Favorites, a ""best of"" double-disc, including the re-recorded material and remastered songs.In 2015, work began on The Next Thing, his first crowdfunded recording that is scheduled to release in April 2016.In addition to songwriting, recording, and touring, Moore enjoys hunting, fishing, and other outdoor pursuits. He and his wife have been married for 32 years, and have two sons and two adopted daughters from China.

"San Miguel, El Salvador","San Miguel (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈsam miˈɣel]) is a city in eastern El Salvador. It is the country's third most populous city. It is located 138 km (86 mi) east of the capital, San Salvador. It is also the capital of  the department of San Miguel and a municipality. The population of the city in 2017 was 518,410.


== History ==
Luis de Moscoso Alvarado established the village of San Miguel de la Frontera (Saint Michael of the Frontier) on May 8, 1530, as a bastion for the conquest of the Lenca kingdom of Chaparrastique (Place of Beautiful Orchids). By 1586 the village had obtained the title of city.
In 1655, a volcanic eruption almost destroyed the entire city. According to legend, the devastation was so severe that only an image of Mary in the parish church was spared.


== Economy ==
The city has been an important center of the agriculture, textile and chemical industries of El Salvador. Since the early 21st century, the services sector, especially health care and commerce, have increased considerably, resulting in significant private investments in hospitals and shopping malls within the city. This has usually been attributed partly to the high inflow of remittances (at least 35% of the total, which represents around 18% of the national GDP ) that Salvadorans living abroad send to families in the eastern zone of the country.
The incomes and wealth of the eastern half of the country are expected to increase following new jobs and businesses associated with the development of the Puerto La Unión; it started operations in 2012.


== Education ==
There are many educational institutions within the city, private and public, including some of the oldest schools in the country. The main universities are the public University of El Salvador ( with its Facultad Multidiciplinaria de Oriente) and the private Universidad de Oriente (UNIVO).The University Gerardo Barrios, the University Modular Abierta.


== Sports ==
The sports infrastructure of San Miguel has had significant development and modernization since the beginning of the past decade. The main sports centers are the national football stadium of ""Juan Francisco Barraza"", the ""Polideportivo Don Bosco"" and the Charlaix Stadium.


== Culture ==
In November, San Miguel celebrates its municipal festivities in honor of ""Nuestra Señora De La Paz"" (Our Lady of Peace),  the San Miguel Carnival being the final and main event that takes place on the last Saturday of the month. With an estimate of 1,000,000 people attending it for its 50th anniversary (as reported by the local media), it is considered the biggest entertainment, music and food festival in El Salvador and one of the largest in Central America. The beginnings of the Carnival itself date from 1959. Currently, this tradition continues to reflect the growth of the city and one of the motors for its economy.

 San Miguel is famous for its night life along Roosevelt Avenue, the main thoroughfare that slices the city in half.

It aired on SBS from April 30 to May 1, 2018, at the 22:00 (KST) time slot.


== Plot ==


=== Episodes 1–2 ===
Living a life of sadness and debts, 33-year-old Do Kang-soo (Choi Tae-joon) works as a loan shark in Shinseong Capital for his and his father's sustenance. His mother Lee In-sook (Nam Gi-ae) has long been away from home since when Kang-soo was still a baby due to her husband Do Jung-man's (Woo Hyun) cruelty and drunkenness. Jung-man, now guilty of ruining his family, works for a junk shop despite his old age and declining health. Kang-soo has been trying to look for her mother but was conned by people claiming they can help him in his search. He had also been thinking so much on how to make his and his father's lives better, even contemplating on stealing money from his boss Hwang Tae-bok (Park Ho-san).
Meanwhile, Kang-soo comes across a flyer by Bliss Laboratory with the words Do you ... want to be happy? (Hangul: 당신...행복해지고 싶나요?; RR: Dangsin ... haengbokhaejigo simnayo?). He visits the laboratory and meets neuroscientist and researcher Dr. Woo Jae-hee (Bae Hae-sun). Dr. Woo presents her team's invention: a glucose-coated amino acid medicinal capsule combined with a protein from the cerebral artery that is injected to the brain to “maximize the feeling of happiness” and make a human subject believe that all of his/her desires “have come true” within a “perfect world.” Dr. Woo takes a tomography of Kang-soo's brain and tells him that he is 96% suitable for the experiment, i.e. he can undergo the test without any problems. When Dr. Woo hands him the contract, Kang-soo decides to declines the offer for his father's sake.
One night at Shinseong Capital, Kang-soo caught his love interest, Tae-bok's 28-year-old girlfriend Ji Sun-young (Jeon Soo-jin), attempting to open Tae-bok's safe. Sun-young, who actually dreams to become a musical actress, does not enjoy her life with Tae-bok. Although he had also been thinking about it, Kang-soo believes stealing the money will not change anything and will even make Tae-bok very furious. Kang-soo drives away with a drunk Sun-young and crashes into an oncoming truck. Kang-soo's father learns of the accident and rushes to the hospital, mourning at the doors of the operating room.
Kang-soo wakes up in the hospital, and realizes that Sun-young has been discharged. Tae-bok gets suspicious of Kang-soo and asks him why Sun-young ended up with him on the night of the accident. Kang-soo decides to return to Bliss Laboratory, but Dr. Woo tells him that, not like before, he has to pay a ₩300,000,000 participation fee due to a rapid increase of participants. The next day, Kang-soo attempts to unlock Tae-bok's safe but he gets caught by Tae-bok. Kang-soo is about to get beaten up by Tae-bok's henchmen when the police arrive to raid the business. As Tae-bok and his men are arrested, Kang-soo sees his co-worker Hong Ki-chul (Kim Kyung-nam) come out of hiding. Suspecting the police stakeout was part of Ki-chul's plan to steal the money, Kang-soo takes all the money in the safe and escapes. He was about to pay his participation fee but upon arriving at Bliss Laboratory's address, the building is already gone. Later, Jung-man reveals to Kang-soo his regrets and that he already had the address where In-sook could recently be living. The father and son reconcile.
Kang-soo receives a call from Ki-chul, telling him that Tae-bok will soon be released due to lack of evidence and requests for them to meet. When he arrives at their supposed meeting place, Kang-soo realizes that Ki-chul had fooled him. He rushes back to his house but finds the money gone; Ki-chul was nowhere to be found. After days of looking for Ki-chul, he watches the news on TV and founds out that Tae-bok has escaped from prison. He is captured by Tae-bok and his henchmen, but as he was about to be buried alive he tells that Ki-chul had stolen the money, just as Ki-chul arrives. Ki-chul hands the bag of money to Tae-bok, but Kang-soo snatches it and runs away, chased by Tae-bok and his men. The police arrive and runs after Tae-bok, but as Kang-soo whispers his wish for Tae-bok to die, a vehicle suddenly drives into the street and runs into Tae-bok, instantly killing him.
Kang-soo becomes very happy and contented over his newfound wealth, and he becomes Sun-young's fiancé. But it is revealed that the “real” Kang-soo is lying in a sleep-like state in a room in Bliss Laboratory with tubes injecting a blue fluid—the “happiness” capsule dissolved in liquid—into his head. Dr. Woo is observing Kang-soo through a window separating Kang-soo and the control room. The scenes starting from Kang-soo waking up in the hospital and onwards were all part of the simulated reality induced by Dr. Woo's capsule. Kang-soo's father is seen in front of Bliss Laboratory's building holding a bracelet with a string of five digits inscribed on it. He sees a seemingly dead body covered in a blanket being brought from the building into a Bliss Laboratory truck. He follows a truck and arrives in an unknown building, where he saw the body being brought into a room. He peeks through the door's window and sees that the dead body, now enclosed in large flames, wore a bracelet like the one he is holding to. With horror, he realizes that he is witnessing one of Bliss Laboratory's dead subjects being burned in a crematorium.


=== Episodes 3–4 ===
The scene goes back to the night of Kang-soo and Sun-young's vehicular accident. Due to severe brain injury, Kang-soo may not live a normal life anymore if he happens to survive. Dr. Woo arrives at the hospital and talks to the grief-stricken Do Jung-man on Kang-soo's chance to be happy. At Bliss Laboratory, Dr. Woo convinces Jung-man to let Kang-soo undergo the experiment, in return for a reward money to be granted to him. With Dr. Woo's assurance and Tae-bok's warning, Jung-man concedes with the testing.
Outside Bliss Laboratory, Jung-man sees a presumably dead body being carried out of the building into a truck. He picks up a bracelet that had fallen from the body. The bracelet have a string of five digits inscribed on it. Meanwhile, Dr. Woo and her team lays Kang-soo on a bed, with small tubes connecting his head to a fluid-filled cylinder. Upon Dr. Woo's signal, the test starts: a “happiness” capsule is dissolved in the cylinder, and the resulting fluid is injected into Kang-woo. The simulated reality (which was revealed in Episodes 1 to 2) starts in Kang-soo's consciousness. Jung-man returns with the bracelet to Bliss Laboratory and sees another body carried into a truck. He follows the truck, and ends up in a crematorium. He realizes that Bliss Laboratory's subjects can actually die from the experiment.
Back to the capsule-induced alternate reality, Kang-soo becomes the CEO of his own company and he is ready to be married to Sun-young. At home, Sun-young asks Kang-soo's father if they have any photos of Kang-soo when he was still young. Keeping his painful past a secret, Kang-soo tells her that his father is too busy to take family pictures, but to his surprise, his father took out a photo album filled with many pictures showing him and his father. Kang-soo also manages to find his mother, who is owning a business by the sea. His mother recognizes him and apologizes for leaving him behind when he was still young.
Meanwhile, in the real world, Jung-man pleads Dr. Woo to let Kang-soo go. He reveals his discovery of the dead subjects, showing her the fallen bracelet. Dr. Woo insists to Jung-man that there is only a 0.1% chance that Kang-soo will perish in the experiment, and if he did die, he would die as a happy person. To Jung-man's shock, he learns from Dr. Woo about Kang-soo visiting the laboratory after reading the message from one of their flyers and declining the offer for Jung-man's sake. Dr. Woo reveals to him that only by the subject's own willpower can the subject force himself out of the simulation. If one is not able to exit, his or her physical activities will eventually stop. And considering the happiness one can experience in the simulation, it may already be too hard for one to exit from the simulation. Devastated, Jung-man asks Dr. Woo to let him see Kang-soo for the last time.
In the simulated reality, Kang-soo's parents are finally reunited. Kang-soo receives a mysterious call telling him to “get out” immediately. He dismisses the call and spends happy times with his parents and Sun-young, taking photos at the seashore. Back at his company, he chases a suspicious hooded man but he loses him, and he suddenly experiences a spell of dizziness. Later, he notices that the scar on his right elbow, which he got when he was still young from one of his father's tantrums, was already gone. Kang-soo starts to feel suspicious. In the real world, the diluted capsule is actually getting used up. Dr. Woo orders to increase the dosage for the test to continue.
In response to the increased dosage, Kang-soo wakes up and finds himself in a new high-rise corporate building. Kang-soo asks Sun-young about the building, and he learns that he had signed a contract and had taken over a larger company as its new CEO. Kang-soo's fears and suspicious grow when, upon asking Sun-young about her dream, she tells him she dreams of owning a building (instead of being an actress). To test her, Kang-soo breaks up with Sun-young and asks her a few seconds later if they could start over again. He expects Sun-young to reject him, but to his surprise, Sun-young easily agreed for them to start over.
Disappointed, Kang-soo gets drunk and falls down. Though he is very dizzy, he saw the hooded man approach him and telling the same warning, to “get out.” He wakes up and finds himself back at home in his bedroom with his mother. Upon asking her if she is okay reuniting with his father, she tells him that she had forgiven his father and that, no matter what, Kang-soo will be the most precious to her. His suspicions dominating, Kang-soo then recalls how her mother quickly recognized him, considering that they have never met each other for the past 30 years. Kang-soo becomes dizzy again, with the image of the hooded man and his warning coming back to his mind.
To rid Kang-soo of his suspicions and make him think of going back to the simulation, Dr. Woo temporarily inhibits the flow of the medicine to his brain. This, she believes, will let him experience reality and let him see “what a nightmare his real life has been.” In consequence, Kang-soo's mother escapes from home, his father becomes a fourth-stage liver cancer patient, Tae-bok is suddenly resurrected and tries to catch him with his henchmen, and Sun-young changes sides and goes back to Tae-bok. Kang-soo hides in hotel room and mourns over his loss; now, he wishes not to go back to his miserable past. In the real world, Dr. Woo then returns his dosage of the medicine, and the simulation shifts back to normal.
Kang-soo meets the hooded man again, who tells him that there is not much time left and he will not last long the simulated reality. The hooded man pleads Kang-soo to “get out” of the fake reality. Kang-soo unmasks the hooded man, who turns out to be the manifestation of his real father. In the real world, it was at this moment when his father visits him in his room and sobs beside him while holding his hand. He asks for forgiveness, tells him that he loves him, and pleads for him to wake up and look at reality. Back in the simulation, the hooded man disappears and Kang-soo gets dizzy again. He realizes that he is not happy at the fake reality that he is in and he wants to see his real father again. With resolve, he decides to exit from the simulation. Dr. Woo rushes to the control room to increase his dosage, but the Kang-soo in the simulation begins plunging himself into the sea. After three counts, he drowns himself into the water, and the Kang-soo in the real world finally wakes up from the simulation.
Kang-soo, still injured from the accident, limps his way out of Bliss Laboratory. On the way, he sees other subjects still immersed in the simulation, including Sun-young. Before he opens the exit, Dr. Woo confronts him, but he dismisses her, simply telling her that his father likes to eat jokbal. Kang-soo arrives at home and finds his father staring longingly at his mother's photographs. Realizing that Kang-soo is already home, the father and son look at each other with tears of joy.
In the closing scene of the series, a photo studio is shown with a photograph of Kang-soo and his father, encased in a frame, put up on display.

Le Kremlin-Bicêtre,"Le Kremlin-Bicêtre (French pronunciation: [lə kʁɛmlɛ̃ bisɛtʁ] ) is a commune in the southern suburbs of Paris, France. It is 4.5 km (2.8 mi) from the center of Paris. It is one of the most densely populated municipalities in Europe.
Le Kremlin-Bicêtre is most famous as the location of the Bicêtre Hospital, where Superintendent Philippe Pinel is credited as being the first to introduce humane methods into the treatment of the mentally ill, in 1793. Its most notorious guest was the Marquis de Sade.


== Name ==
The name has roots both in England and Russia. Le Kremlin-Bicêtre was originally a hamlet called simply Bicêtre and located within the commune of Gentilly. The name Bicêtre comes from the manor built there by John of Pontoise, Bishop of Winchester (England), in the end of the 13th century. The name of this Manor of Winchester was corrupted into Vinchestre, then Bichestre, and eventually Bicêtre. The Bicêtre Hospital was built starting in 1634 on the ruins of the manor.
In 1813, the Bicêtre Hospital acted as a major reception point for evacuated casualties of the Grande Armée from the French invasion of Russia. Veterans of the invasion of Russia used to gather in a tavern near Bicêtre Hospital. This tavern was soon renamed Au sergent du Kremlin (""At the Kremlin sergeant"") in reference to the Moscow Kremlin where the veterans had camped.
Gradually the name Kremlin was used for the whole neighborhood around the Bicêtre Hospital, and appeared for the first time officially in an ordnance map of 1832. Later the names Kremlin and Bicêtre were joined together and became the official name of the area.


== History ==
The commune of Le Kremlin-Bicêtre was created on 13 December 1896 by detaching its territory from the commune of Gentilly.


== Population ==


== Transport ==
Le Kremlin-Bicêtre is served by Le Kremlin-Bicêtre station on Paris Métro Line 7.

Ebony Fashion Fair,"Ebony Fashion Fair (also known as the Ebony Traveling Fashion Fair) was an annual fashion event created by Eunice Johnson, co–founder of the Chicago, Illinois–based Johnson Publishing Company. The show ran across the United States and other countries from 1958 until 2009. In addition to the fashion fair, the company also created a cosmetic line named Fashion Fair Cosmetics, in 1973.  As of 2017, Fashion Fair Cosmetics are still available for purchase.


== History ==
In 1956, John H. Johnson, founder of the Johnson Publishing Company, was approached by Jessie Dent (the wife of the president of Dillard University), who asked Johnson to supply models for a charity fundraiser benefiting the Flint-Goodridge Hospital located on Dillard University's New Orleans campus. Reluctant to use the models featured in the magazines published by his company, Johnson instead offered to provide the clothing.  Johnson and Dent then came to an agreement: Johnson Publishing Company would supply the garments for the fundraiser, and, each ticket to enter the show would include a subscription to either Ebony or Jet Magazine—both published by Johnson's company.
The Ebony Fashion Fair was launched in 1958 by the Johnson Publishing company and repeated annually for five decades under Eunice Walker Johnson; the director and producer of the show.  The Ebony Fashion Fair (also known as the Ebony Travelling Fashion Fair), traveled to 30 cities over its 51-year run providing exclusive fashion to “hundreds of thousands attendees across the United States, Canada and the Caribbean” (Bivins.11). The show was held in 187 venues with audiences as large as 5,000 attendees.  The Ebony Fashion Fair not only helped to boost the Johnson Publishing Company's brand identity, it also raised $55 million in funds for African American charities.  The show featured male and female models of mostly African-American descent modeling fashions from top European designers such as: Yves St Laurent, Oscar de la Renta, Pierre Cardin, Paco Rabanne, Givenchy, Jean Paul Gaultier, Valentino, and Emanuel Ungaro. The Fashion Fair held its last show in 2009, due to Eunice Walkers' death in January, 2010.


=== Fashion Fair Cosmetics ===
When Eunice Johnson noticed that the models at the Ebony Fashion Fair ""were mixing foundations to create the right blend to match their hues"", she initially approached existing cosmetics companies and asked them to develop make-up lines which would suit the specific needs of women of color. However, as she was met with resistance from the companies she approached, she and her husband, John H. Johnson, created the Capsule Collection: a small make-up compact in a mail-order package. Due to high-demand, the product led to the creation of a full cosmetic line named Fashion Fair Cosmetics, after the fashion show in 1973. According to Fortune, Fashion Fair Cosmetics was once the largest black-owned cosmetics company in the world. In April 2019, a United Kingdom creditor petitioned a judge to force the company to sell its Fashion Fair Cosmetics UK assets. In November 2019, the brand was acquired by Cheryl Mayberry McKissack and Desirée Rogers.


== Legacy ==
From March 2013 thru May 2014, the Chicago History Museum displayed an exhibition titled Inspiring Beauty: 50 Years Of Ebony Fashion Fair.  The exhibition featured several ensembles featured in Fashion Fair shows during its half-century history.  The exhibition traveled nationally beginning in fall 2014, with stops including the Museum of Design Atlanta and the Milwaukee Art Museum.

Aussie Rules Footy,"Aussie Rules Footy is the first AFL simulation video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was developed by Melbourne based Beam Software and published under their ""Laser Beam"" publishing title in 1992. The release was Australian-only with distribution handled through Mattel's Australian operations.


== Gameplay ==
The game involves playing a game of Australian rules football from a third-person perspective, with the ability to perform the basic actions of a typical Australian rules football player. The game can be played by one person playing against the computer team, or by two players against each other. There is also a kick to kick mode, and a season mode where 1, 4 or 6 players can play multiple games in a season finishing with a grand final.
The objective of the game is for the players team to have the highest score at the end of the game. A team can score by kicking either a goal (6 points) or a behind (1 point). To move the football, a player with the ball can either kick or handball the ball, and a player without the ball can either mark the ball or tackle an opposition player with the ball. 


=== Scoring ===
When a player is close to the goal (approx. 55–60 metres), an accuracy bar appears at the bottom of the screen. When the ball is kicked, the closer the marker is to the centre of the bar, the more accurate the kick to goal. The accuracy bar makes it considerably difficult to kick a goal on the run, especially from a distance. When a player is very close to the goal (approx. 15 metres), the accuracy marker will always be in the centre of the bar and any kick by the player will be a goal.


=== Start of play ===
As in the real rules of Australian rules football, there are times in play where a player from each team tries to take possession of the ball that has been bounced (for the start of play after a goal, or a ball-up), or thrown (for an out of bounds) by the umpire. During a bounce, using the arrow keys will start the player moving, only after the ball has touched the ground. Pressing A at the moment of contact will tap the ball to another team member, while pressing B will knock the ball a larger distance but not to a particular player. During a ball up or a boundary throw in, pressing A will make the player leap into the air, and then the same actions apply as a bounce when the player reaches the ball with his hand.


== Teams ==
The teams in the game are based on 14 of 15 teams in the 1991 AFL season. However, despite West Coast Eagles players being depicted on the games cover, within the game itself the Western Australian team was simply known as Perth. In addition, fictional teams based in Darwin, Canberra and Hobart were playable in the game.

R. J. Reynolds Memorial Auditorium,"The R. J. Reynolds Memorial Auditorium, located in Winston-Salem, NC, was built 1919–1924 under the direction of architect Charles Barton Keen (designer of the R. J. Reynolds estate, Reynolda House). Keen also designed the adjacent Richard J. Reynolds High School. Both buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
The Auditorium and adjacent school sit on a tract of land formerly known as ""Silver Hill."" The 28-acre (110,000 m2) tract of land now encompasses the Auditorium, the school, Hanes Park (named after the founder of Hanes Clothing Company and then-mayor James G. Hanes), the Calvin H. Wiley Middle School and the Winston-Salem Central YMCA.
The Auditorium is now operated jointly by the Administration of the Richard J. Reynolds High School and the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools. An auditorium manager is hired to take care of the day-to-day operations of the building and scheduling of performances and events.
The Auditorium is one of the oldest and largest performing arts centers in the City of Winston-Salem. The building can comfortably seat 1898 people, with 857 seats on the main Orchestra level and 1,041 seats located on the Mezzanine/Balcony area.


== History ==
In 1919, after the death of her husband R. J. Reynolds in 1918, Mrs. Katharine Smith Reynolds  donated a large tract of land then known as ""Silver Hill"" to the City of Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Her plan was to have a grand school and auditorium built in memory of her late husband.
While the Richard J. Reynolds High School would serve the youth of the city, the Auditorium would serve the entire community and act as a gathering place in order for all citizens to participate in the arts. The building of the Auditorium only added to the City of Winston-Salem's reputation as the ""City of the Arts.""
The building was completed in 1924. By the time it was dedicated in a glorious ceremony on May 8, 1924, Katharine Reynolds, who had married J. Edward Johnston in 1921, was hospitalized with a difficult pregnancy.  She died on May 23, never having attended a production in the auditorium she had built in her first husband's memory.
A few weeks later, the first commencement exercises for the Richard J. Reynolds High School would be held in the Auditorium. On November 24, 1924, the Auditorium would play host to the first of its many famous guests, Harry Houdini. Other guests have included Jim Croce before his untimely death and pianist Peter Nero, both in the early 1970s.


== Architectural and artistic elements ==
The Grand Lobby of the Auditorium contains many pieces of art unique to the building itself. In the Lobby, one can find two large portraits, one of R. J. Reynolds and the other of Katharine Smith Reynolds. The portraits were made by Richard J. Reynolds High School graduate Joe King who also had the honor of creating a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.
The Grand Lobby also contains three marble statues. The statues are duplicates of famous Italian works and were sculpted in Italy and transported to the United States, specifically for the construction of the Auditorium.
Within the main Orchestra level of the Auditorium, one can see a portrait of R. J. Reynolds III, whose family gave large amounts of money towards the renovation and restoration of the building (2000–2002).
Before the 2000-2002 renovation and restoration of the building, a large piece of custom made carpet sat just inside the Main Orchestra level at the middle doors leading from the Grand Lobby. The carpet piece featured a large tobacco leaf, in honor of R. J. Reynolds and his R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. The carpet piece was removed during the renovation and restoration and never replaced, with it being decided that the money could be better used toward upgrading the state of the art Auditorium sound system rather than buying a new custom made carpet piece.


== Traditions associated with the Auditorium and School ==
Before every performance at the Auditorium, members of the student-run Auditorium Technical Staff and Crew place roses under the portrait of Katherine Smith Reynolds-Johnston, in honor of her gift of the Auditorium and school. It is rumored the roses also help to ward off the ""ghost"" of Katharine Reynolds who haunts the building.
The title of the school hymn, originally written as the school song in 1949 by Olive Thomasina (""Tommye"") Ring, ""Her Portals Tall and Wide,"" refers to the large columns of the Auditorium. The Auditorium's portico and columns stand at three stories tall and face downtown Winston-Salem.
The current school song, with its official title of ""Alma Mater,"" is also known as ""Amid the Pines"". Part of the first verse reads, ""Amid the pines, she proudly stands; to her our voices rise."" The Auditorium and School are situated on a large hill populated with grandiose pine trees which cover the entire campus. The pine trees are also mentioned in the school hymn: ""Her pleasant paths, her trees, whisper courage through the breeze."" Following every assembly, PTSA meeting or school performance inside the Auditorium, at one time including commencement, ""The Alma Mater"" is sung. During these assemblies, semi-formal or business casual dress, usually including blazers, shirts and ties for men, is customary attire for any person gracing the Auditorium's large stage. Tradition dictates that as the Alma Mater is sung, upon the line ending with ""... dear Old Reynolds High"", in three short beats, in a 3/4 time, the assembly should not stomp their feet because it is considered disrespectful.
Through the years, the hill upon which the school and Auditorium stand has become known as ""Society Hill."" The name commemorates the donation of the land and money to build the Auditorium and school from Mrs. Reynolds. a prominent member of the community. Generations of children, including some of the Reynolds' own children and Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) (class of 1974), have attended the school.


== Current operations ==
The auditorium is currently managed by Trevor Anderson and Robert Kratz. The auditorium serves as a venue for the Winston-Salem Forsyth County School System and private renters. It has received many off-Broadway productions and local dance companies. The drama department at Reynolds is currently taught by Teri Beadle who teaches out of the Black Box Theater. The orchestra director is currently Margaret Rehder, and the band director is Jonathan Hamiel with assistant Adrian Thompson. Caitie Reece and Amelia Hailey are the current dance teachers. All teach in the Arts building adjacent to the main Auditorium. The chorus director is Joshua Settlemyre, who teaches in the chorus room, also adjacent to the main part of the Auditorium. The Choral, Orchestra, Band and Dance Departments all use the Auditorium regularly for performances.

Presidency of Fernando de la Rúa,"Fernando de la Rúa's tenure as president of Argentina began when he took office on 10 December 1999, and ended with his resignation on 21 December 2001 in the wake of the December 2001 crisis.


== Election ==
Fernando de la Rúa was elected on 24 October 1999 and took office on 10 December 1999. De la Rúa ran on the Alliance Party ticket as a Radical Civic Union member with running mate Carlos Álvarez. Along with the De la Rúa–Alvarez win, the Alliance Party gained a majority over the Justicialist Party in the Chamber of Deputies.
The De la Rúa–Álvarez ticket defeated the Peronist candidates Eduardo Duhalde and Ramón Ortega with 48.5% of the vote against 38.09%. In third place, with 10.09% of the vote, was the former economy minister Domingo Cavallo.
De la Rúa ran a successful TV advertising campaign with the slogan ""They say I'm boring."" The advertisement sought to be in contrast with a public perception of frivolity within the Carlos Menem administration. The campaign was led by Ramiro Agulla, David Ratto (the publicist for Raul Alfonsin in the 1983 elections), and Antonio de la Rúa, son of Fernando de la Rúa. During his father's presidency, Antonio de la Rúa led ""The Sushi Group"" (El grupo sushi), which was often criticized for its political influence.


== 1999 and 2000 ==
The public rejection of Menem along with the country's deteriorating economic situation strongly contributed to de la Rúa's victory. By the end of 1999, Argentina's GDP had dropped 3.4%. Unemployment had approached 14%. Although lower than previously, poverty was still at 30%. The country faced serious education and public health problems, and the political leadership had a poor public image.
The Peronist government had left a billion pesos deficit and an external annual debt of approximately 150 billion pesos, which would grow to nearly 25 billion pesos in the next year. 
De la Rúa took harsh adjustment measures in the face of the country's financial situation. In January 2000, he raised taxes on the middle classes and upper classes. This policy was part of an overall package intended to improve the economy and attend to outstanding debts such as the Teacher Incentive Fund.  However, it was too little to solve the deterioration of the public finances.
De la Rúa also intervened in the political situation in Corrientes province. There had been several months of consecutive labor strikes in the province.  De la Rúa replaced governor Hugo Rubén Perie with Ramón Mestre.
On 8 June 2000, Menem was placed under house arrest on charges of leading a conspiracy to illegally sell 6,500 tons of weapons and ammunition to Ecuador and Croatia.  A second charge was falsifying the contents of three presidential decrees. However, on November 12, the Supreme Court of Argentina Decision ruled that there was no conspiracy and forgery and ordered Menem release  
Throughout 2000, the De la Rúa government sought to control public spending, lower domestic interest rates and maintain monetary and financial stability. The year ended with a slight decline of 0.5% of GDP and an unemployment rate of 14.7% (INDEC October 2000). International reserves remained at 33 billion dollars and the fiscal deficit was reduced by about 5 billion pesos. 
De la Rúa launched  the Infrastructure Plan.  Through agreements with provincial governments, and with private funding, he sought to perform road, water and housing improvements throughout the country for 20 billion dollars. De la Rúa enacted the plan through decree since, according to Interior Minister Federico Storani, there was no assurance that the Argentine Congress would approve the law as quickly as necessary.
De la Rúa's government asked for further assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and private banks to reduce the pressure of foreign debt. In December 2000, Economy Minister Jose Luis Machinea negotiated a bailout package of about 40,000 million dollars, known as a financial shield. 


== 2001 ==


=== Education Reform Act ===
In 2001, De la Rúa proposed the Education Reform Act.  The objectives of the act were seen as an attempt to weaken the power of large unions in favor of small ones, and to lower labor costs. The opposition Justicialists' opposed the measure and succeeded in weakening. Negotiations involved the then Labor Minister Alberto Flamarique and union leader Hugo Moyano. Moyano opposed the Act, arguing that it would result in lower wages and that it would be driven by the IMF. Flamarique promised that the national labor associations would still receiver union dues, but this was divided internally to the General Labor Confederation. 
In October Vice President Carlos Alvarez resigned over allegations that he was bribing senator to vote for the Education Reform Act. The Alvarez resignation and the handling of the Act brought desertions from the center-left party congressmen who were dissatisfied with De la Rúa  style of government.


=== Political weakness ===
In 2001, the  Justicialista Party controlled the Senate while De la Rúa had a slim majority in the Chamber of Deputies. Trade union unrest continued, with seven general strikes. Frepaso began to distance themselves from De la Rúa after the Alvarez resignation, the appointment of Domingo Cavallo and the sustained economic policy. The head of the UCR, Raul Alfonsin, trying to avoid breaking the party.
In the 2001 legislative elections, the Peronist party won control of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputes. The Peronists won with 40% nationwide, versus 24% for the Alliance.  The Alliance lost more than 4,500,000 votes from the election two years earlier. 
Piqueteros groups throughout the country started blocking roads and streets in protest.  While the Justicialist Party held the presidency of the Senate by Ramon Puerta, and appearing in the line of succession presidencial.


=== Economic programs ===
In January 2001 the Central Bank's international reserves reached a record high of 37.38 billion dollars. Economy Minister Ricardo Lopez Murphy announced widespread government budget cuts. Following this announcement, thousands of Argentines, especially students took to the streets in protest.In March 2001, Minister of the Economy José Luis Machinea was replaced by then Defense Minister Ricardo Lopez Murphy. He put in place plans to stimulate the economy by making large cuts in public spending, withdrawing funds from areas such as health and education. Lopez Murphy's measures received fierce opposition from the Radical Party and its youth and college arms. Lopez Murphy was forced to retire after just 16 days in office.
De la Rúa replaced Lopez Murphy with Domingo Cavallo, who had held the job during the Menem government. Cavallo took office with the backing of the opposition and a strong push from the leader of Frepaso, Carlos ""Chacho"" Alvarez. However, Cavallo generated  suspicion within the radicalist party. Cavallo took office promising an annual growth of 5%, trying to reduce distortionary taxes and reviving the industry. A tax on banking operations was approved and some delegation of power to the legislature was made. However, the markets and the international lending agencies reacted negatively. 
In July 2001, because of the tax burden and the inability to normalize the economy, Cavallo turned to a strong economic orthodoxy. He presented a plan of ""zero deficit"", with a new board cut in public expenditure management to avoid spending more than it earned. The new program resulted in heavy resistance in the legislature. 
In the summer, the government managed to attain parliamentary approval of the law on deposits intangibility. In October, unemployment rose to 18.3%. By December, the BCRA international reserves would fall to about 20 billion dollars.
In November, the government began a restructuring of external debt commitments, so-called ""mega-swap"". By the end of that month, the unprecedented worsening of the economic situation, investments fell due to the complicated situation policy that caused public distrust in the financial system. Strong withdrawals occurred from deposits in banks. 
Cavallo imposed restrictions involving the freezing of funds deposited in banks, a measure known as the ""corralito"". The measure was enacted on December 1 and originally allowed only one withdrawal of 250 pesos per deposit per week in cash and the ban on sending of money outside of the country and the obligation to perform most of the business operations by checks, credit cards or debit cards. These measures were scheduled to last for 90 days.
These measures were highly unpopular. The IMF, meanwhile, refused to send 1.26 billion that was committed to working under the loan known as ""shield"", arguing that Argentina would not have met their commitments to maintain ""zero deficit"".


== End of presidency ==
By December, looting and rioting were occurring in major parts of Argentina . During the unrest, 27 people died and over 2,000 were injured. 
On December 19, De la Rúa declared a state of siege throughout the country. At midnight, Cavallo and the rest of the cabinet resigned.  On December 20 the City of Buenos Aires and Greater Buenos Aires experienced large waves of looting of supermarkets and retail outlets  Thousands of people marched demanding the resignation the government.  in the Buenos Aires downtown federal police were overwhelmed, but managed to keep violence out of the Plaza de Mayo.
The unions called for strikes to protest the state of siege. Initially the CTA began a 24-hour strike on December 20.   
Having lost the support of most of his own party, De la Rúa was forced out. At 19:45 on 20 December 2001, he resigned and left Casa Rosada by helicopter 
De la Rúa was replaced by San Luis Governor Adolfo Rodriguez Saa.

HMS Electra (1808),"HMS Electra was a 16-gun brig-sloop. She was built by the Enterprise Ethéart, Saint-Malo, as the French Curieux-class brig Espiègle and launched in 1804. She was armed in 1807 at Saint Servan. The British frigate Sybille captured her on 16 August 1808. There was already an Espiegle in the Royal Navy so the Navy took the vessel they had just captured into service as HMS Electra, her predecessor Electra having been wrecked in March.  Electra captured one American privateer before she was sold in 1816.

The three ships were sailing across the Bay of Biscay en route to Martinique to deliver supplies when they encountered Comet, under Captain Cuthbert Featherstone Daly, on 17 August. Comet soon captured Sylphe but the other two escaped. The next day Captain Clotworthy Upton in Sybille captured Espiègle. Diligente, though, escaped.


== British service ==
Electra was only commissioned in February 1812 under Commander William Gregory and spent most of her brief career escorting convoys to and from Newfoundland. She sailed for Newfoundland both on 27 April 1812 and on 17 March 1813. She did make one capture.
On 7 July 1813 Electra captured a U.S. privateer near Newfoundland after a six-hour chase. She was the schooner Growler, pierced for 14 guns but carrying only one long 24-pounder gun and four 18-pounder guns. She had a crew of 60 men.  Growler, under Captain N. Lindsey, had had a relatively successful cruise having taken the ship Arabella, a brig, the schooner Prince of Wales, and the brig Ann.Commander Thomas Walbeoff Cecil took command in June 1814, but died of yellow fever in October in the West Indies. (On  28 April 1814, then Lieutenant Cecil of Argo had killed Captain Hassard Stackpole, of Statira, in a duel. Earlier, Cecil had served under Stackpole in Tonnant, and the duel grew out of that experience.) Cecil died of yellow fever at Port Royal on 24 October 1814.


== Fate ==
Cecil's replacement, Commander Richard Lewin, paid Electra off in 1815. On 17 June 1816 the Commissioners of the Navy offered her for sale at Deptford. She was sold there for £800 on 11 July 1816.

Walverden Water,"Walverden Water is a minor river in Lancashire, England. It is approximately 2.6 miles (4.2 km) long and has a catchment area of 5.04 square miles (1,304.23 ha).


== Course ==
Beginning at Walverden Reservoir, which is fed by Catlow Brook (from the Coldwell Reservoirs near Boulsworth Hill) and its tributaries, the river heads northwest into the town of Nelson. It flows under Scholefield Mill, where it is presumably still met by Clough Head Beck, and continues on through Walverden Park. Shortly afterwards it enters a series of culverts as it passes through the town centre and under the East Lancashire railway line viaduct and the A56 Leeds Road bridge, emerging at Bradley Road and collecting Bradley Syke. It turns to the north and then west and is again culverted, before entering a tunnel under the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and junction 13 of the M65 motorway, emerging next to Nelson and Colne College and shortly after flowing into Pendle Water.


== History ==
The name possibly originates from a contraction of the Old English words wælla (stream) and fyrhþ (frith), with denu (valley). Water (OE wæter) is a common name for a stream, most often found in southern Scotland.Walverden Water anciently formed the boundary between the manor of Ightenhill and the manor of Colne, also dividing what was then the township of Marsden in two, with Great Marsden to the northeast and Little Marsden on the southwest side. The lord of Clitheroe had a mill on the river in 1311, thought to have been sited near the confluence with Clough Head Beck, and there is also evidence of an ancient fulling mill close to the reservoir. Duchy of Lancaster records show that Richard Towneley of Towneley Hall was prevented from operating a corn mill called Walveden Mill in 1482 (as was his son John in 1495) as it caused a loss to the king's mills at Burnley and Colne.The first Ordnance Survey map of the area, published in 1848, shows a corn mill with a pond at what was still the small village of Bradley (today the centre of town). Also a little further north, a sluice appears to feed a mill race to a small pond, across the canal at Hodge Bank, the only cotton mill visible, located next to Reedyford House. By the time Nelson developed into a mill town water-power had given way to the steam engine, however these still required a good supply of water. Walverden Mill (built before 1850), Victoria Mill (1857) and Vale Street Shed (1867) were constructed at sites next to the river in the decades that followed.Although the act that authorised the creation of a compensation reservoir passed in 1866, construction was delayed as all the tenders exceeded the budget of £3196. It was competed by 1869, under the direct management of the local board with a capacity of 250,000 imp gal (1.1 million L). Consequently, several more cotton mills were built along the river, including: Brook Street Mills (by 1884), Bradley Shed (by 1890), Clover Mill (by 1909), Marsden Mill (by 1909), Scholefield Mill (by 1910) and the Valley Mills (first three built between 1895–1910, No.4 in 1930). As was the Premier Dye Works, which operated from before 1909 until 1963, with the river also vital for its water supply.In 2010 United Utilities was fined after a blockage caused sewage to leak into the river through a storm overflow for four days in June, causing ""a significant amount of pollution that had a serious impact on water quality"".
A year-long, Environment Agency led flood-alleviation scheme in the town-centre, completed in 2011, included raising the existing flood walls, the removal of an old weir and sluice and repairs to the walls and culverts with some of the underground sections opened up.

 `Walfreden` is the earliest referenced name for the stream dating back to the late 1400`s when the Towneley`s built a mill at the village of Bradley on `Walfreden` water. `Walfred` is a medieval Norse and Germanic name meaning `Ruler of Peace`

Kosovo–Latvia relations,"Kosovo–Latvia relations are foreign relations between the Republic of Kosovo and the Republic of Latvia. Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008 and Latvia recognised it on 20 February 2008. Latvian and Kosovan governments established diplomatic relations on 11 June 2008. However, Latvia's involvement in Kosovo dates back to 2000 when it first sent peacekeeping troops.


== History ==
In 2000, Latvian President Vaira Vike-Freiberga suggested that NATO's willingness to intervene in Kosovo means that the Western alliance will be prepared to come to the aid of Latvia and other East European countries should Moscow threaten them at some point in the future. She stated: ""Kosovo is not a member of the NATO alliance and yet the alliance was able to take action when it felt that, according to the principles on which it is founded, action and intervention was necessary. I would expect it to do no less anywhere else in Europe.""In November 2005, Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova met Latvian Foreign Minister, Artis Pabriks.Following the formal recognition of Kosovo in February 2008, Latvian Foreign Minister Maris Riekstins said: ""Latvia is ready to share its experience in order to facilitate Kosovo's development towards its Europeisation"". The Minister also stressed the significance of Latvia's involvement in both the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX Kosovo), the key objective of which is to assist Kosovar public administration, courts, and law enforcement bodies, and in the International Steering Group for Kosovo.In July 2008, Foreign Minister Riekstins visited Kosovo and met with President Fatmir Sejdiu, Prime Minister Hashim Thaçi and Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni. President Seijdiu said he was appreciative of the work of the representatives of the Latvian Contingent within the NATO-led peacekeeping forces (KFOR), and also the participation of Latvian experts in the EU Rule of Law Mission (EULEX) in Kosovo.During this visit, Minister Riekstins said: ""One can draw certain parallels between the history of Latvia and Kosovo, because Latvia too in the early 1990s had to start from the very beginning in the formation of state institutions, this is precisely why we are prepared to share our experience with the government of Kosovo, offering both our political and practical support.""


== Peacekeeping ==
In July 1999, the Latvian Parliament approved by a majority of 71–6 to send peacekeepers to Kosovo. In 2000, the first Latvian troops were sent to Kosovo for peacekeeping. In 2005, Latvia committed 105 troops to the peacekeeping effort in Kosovo. Latvia currently has 17 troops serving in Kosovo as peacekeepers in the NATO led Kosovo Force.

Spiridon Drozhzhin,"Spiridon Dmitryevich Drozhzhin (Russian: Спиридо́н Дми́триевич Дро́жжин, IPA: [sʲpʲɪrʲɪˈdon ˈdmʲitrʲɪjɪvʲɪdʑ ˈdroʐːɨn, - ˈdroʑːɪn] ; 18 December 1848 – 24 December 1930) was a Russian Empire and later Soviet poet.


== Biography ==
Drozhzhin was born in the village of Nizovka, part of what is now Tver Oblast. He only spent two winters at school, and then the 11-year-old boy was sent to St. Petersburg to work. He spent the following years wandering around Russia, and mastered many crafts.  During his stay in St. Petersburg (1860–1871), he worked on his self-education and got to know works by, among others, Nikolay Nekrasov, Aleksey Koltsov, Ivan Nikitin, and Leo Tolstoy. At the age of 16, he wrote his first poem and in 1867, started his diary which he kept for the rest of his life. His poems were first published in 1873 in a magazine called Gramotey (The Educated One). This publication was followed by others. Due to his poor state of financial affairs, and the influence of Count Leo Tolstoy, whom he met in 1892 and 1897, he had returned home to Tver region in 1896 and devoted himself to writing. 
The son of a serf, he earned renown as a talented self-educated poet. He welcomed the October Revolution, which he saw as the realization of the people's hopes and aspirations. This is expressed in his poems Opening Song (1920), At the Village Assembly (1920), and In Memory of V. I. Lenin (1924). Drozhzhin’s poetry was influenced by Aleksey Koltsov and Nikolay Nekrasov. Some of his verses have been set to music and have become part of Russian folklore. In 1938, a museum devoted to Drozhzhin was opened in the settlement of Novozavidovski in Tver Oblast.The Russian Academy of Sciences awarded him with two medals for his poetry. Several of Drozhzhin's poems were translated into German by the poet Rainer Maria Rilke.

Convention of Kütahya,"The Convention of Kütahya, also known as the Peace Agreement of Kütahya, ended the Egyptian–Ottoman War (1831–1833) in May 1833.


== Information ==
At the convention, the Ottoman provinces of Syria and Adana were ceded to Egypt, and Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt became governor-general of the two provinces. But the settlement of the Peace Agreement was not satisfactory to either party, resulting in the Second Ottoman-Egyptian War in 1839–1841.


== Overview ==
Muhammad Ali of Egypt, ostensibly only a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire, was seeking to increase his personal power and gain control over Palestine, Syria and Arabia. In late 1831, he took his newly reformed army into a war against the Ottoman Sultan, Mahmud II, and easily defeated Ottoman forces and threatened Constantinople itself. While Britain and France were sympathetic to Muhammad Ali, Nicholas I sent a Russian army to the assistance of the Turks. This intervention brought about peace by May 1833, which left Muhammad Ali of Egypt in control of Syria and Arabia.


== Text of the Firman ==
The firman (issued by the Sultan on the 6 May 1833) was addressed to all the authorities of the empire:

"" The assurances of fidelity and of devotion, lastly given to me by the Governor of Egypt, Mahomet Ali Pacha, and his son Ibrahim, having been accepted, I have granted them my imperial benignity. The governments of Candia and Egypt are continued to Mahomet Ali. And in reference to his special claim, I have granted him the provinces of Damascus, Tripoli-in-Syria, Sidon, Saphet, Aleppo, the districts of Jerusalem and Nablous, with the conduct of pilgrims and the commandment of the Tcherde (the yearly offering to the tomb of the Prophet). His son, Ibrahim Pacha, has again the title of Sheikh and Harem of Mekka, and the district of Jedda; and farther, I have acquiesced in his request to have the district of Adana ruled by the Treasury of Taurus, with the title of Mohassil.""
The text goes on to offer amnesty to all persons for the events in Asia Minor, and charges the authorities to tranquillize the inhabitants, and to obtain their prayers for the Sultan.

At its southernmost end, Taylor Valley becomes Quinn Gully, a mainly ice-free gully, which descends between MacDonald Hills and Hjorth Hill to Explorers Cove in New Harbour. It was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (1997) after Thomas Quinn, supervisor of Continental Air Operations, Antarctic Support Associates.Scar Peak overlooks the valley's northern wall, east of the Lacroix Glacier.
Taylor Valley was discovered by the British National Antarctic Expedition (1901–04), it was more fully explored by the BrAE (1907–09) and the BrAE (1910–13), and named after Australian geologist Thomas Griffith Taylor.
In the oblique aerial photo at right, the tan bands are sandstone layers from the Beacon Supergroup, a series of sedimentary rock layers formed at the bottom of a shallow sea between 250 million and 400 million years ago. Throughout that period, Earth's southern continents were locked into the supercontinent Gondwana.
The dark band of rock that divides the sandstone is dolerite (sometimes called diabase), a volcanic rock that forms underground. The distinctive dolerite intrusion—or sill—is a remnant of a massive volcanic plumbing system that produced major eruptions about 180 million years ago. The eruptions likely helped tear Gondwana apart.

Asa Lovejoy,"Asa Lawrence Lovejoy (March 14, 1808 – September 10, 1882) was an American pioneer and politician in the region that would become the U.S. state of Oregon. He is best remembered as a founder of the city of Portland, Oregon.  He was an attorney in Boston, Massachusetts before traveling by land to Oregon; he was a legislator in the Provisional Government of Oregon, mayor of Oregon City, and a general during the Cayuse War that followed the Whitman massacre in 1847. He was also a candidate for Provisional Governor in 1847, before the Oregon Territory was founded, but lost that election.
Lovejoy continued his political career during territorial period as a member of both chambers of the Oregon Territorial Legislature; he served as the first Speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives in 1849. He was also a delegate to the Oregon Constitutional Convention held in 1857 that paved the way for Oregon's entry into the Union. He was part owner of the Oregon Telegraph newspaper, and worked on railroad development in the Willamette Valley after leaving politics.  Lovejoy Street in Northwest Portland and the Lovejoy Fountain in Downtown Portland are named in his honor.


== Early life ==
Lovejoy was born in Groton, Massachusetts, on March 14, 1808. His parents were Betsy Lovejoy (née Lawrence) and Doctor Samuel Lovejoy. In the Eastern United States, he attended college at both Cambridge College and Amherst College, before studying law and passing the Maine bar to become an attorney. After leaving Boston he moved west to Missouri, but left the bottom lands of that state for the unorganized Oregon Country due to poor health.


== Oregon Country ==
Lovejoy first traveled to the Oregon Country in 1842 over the Oregon Trail. He was part of a wagon train led by Elijah White that arrived at the Whitman Mission in what is now eastern Washington State. During this trip he was briefly held captive with another immigrant by Native Americans before arriving at the Whitman's. At the mission, Lovejoy agreed to join Marcus Whitman on a trip to return east during the winter. Lovejoy returned  to Oregon in 1843, as part of the Great Migration that helped open up the Oregon Trail to large migrations, settling in the Willamette Valley. Upon returning to the region, Lovejoy set up a law practice in Oregon City, the seat of government during the Provisional Government period.


=== Portland ===
In 1843, Lovejoy and traveling companion William Overton split a claim to a 640 acres (2.6 km2) tract along the Willamette River. This site would later become part of downtown Portland. Overton held the land, as Lovejoy settled elsewhere. Overton soon sold his share to Francis Pettygrove and Lovejoy and Pettygrove held their famous coin toss in 1845 to decide the name of the city which was being platted on the claim. Each desired to name the area after his hometown. Pettygrove, from Portland, Maine, won the toss, and the town site became known as Portland, Oregon. The two would plat sixteen blocks of the town that year; Lovejoy later sold his stake to Benjamin Stark in 1845. Also in 1845, Lovejoy married Elizabeth McGary. They would have five children: William, Amos, Ada, Elizabeth, and Nellie. In 1846, he was the last administrator of the Ewing Young estate, whose death had precipitated the formation of the Provisional Government of Oregon.


== Political career ==
In 1844, Asa Lovejoy was elected to the Provisional Legislature of Oregon to represent Clackamas District. Lovejoy ran for the newly created office of governor that replaced the Executive Committee in 1845 with the adoption of the Second Organic Laws of Oregon. George Abernethy won the election after he received the most votes with 228, followed by Osbourne Russell with 130, William J. Bailey with 75, and finally Lovejoy with 71 votes. Though he lost the election for governor, he was elected as mayor of Oregon City that year.Lovejoy returned to the legislature in 1846 and served as Speaker of the body. In 1847, Lovejoy ran against Abernethy for governor a second time. Lovejoy lost the election 536 to 520. From 1847 to 1848, he served as adjunct general during the Cayuse War, the war resulting from the Whitman Massacre.Lovejoy was elected in 1848 to what would be the final session of the Provisional Legislature, which was held in late 1848 into early 1849. However, Lovejoy now representing Vancouver District north of the Columbia River resigned before the session started. In September 1848, he traveled with a group to California during the California Gold Rush, but returned aboard the brig Undine in January 1849 after six weeks in California. During the same session he resigned from, he was selected by the Provisional Legislature as Supreme Judge of the government on February 16, 1849, but never served and the Provisional government was dissolved the following month with the arrival of the territorial government.Once the government of the Oregon Territory arrived in March 1849, a new legislature with two chambers was established. Lovejoy was elected to the first session of this legislature, first serving in the lower chamber Oregon House of Representatives. Representing Clackamas District again, he also became the first Speaker of the Oregon Territorial Legislature. In 1851, he returned to the legislature, serving in the upper chamber Council. The following year, he remained in the Council, but now elected as a Whig Party politician. In 1854, he was back in the House of Representatives, and in 1856 he served in one final session, now as a Democratic Party member.In 1857, Lovejoy represented Clackamas County at the Oregon Constitutional Convention in Salem. The convention created the Oregon Constitution in preparation for the territory becoming a U.S. state. Lovejoy, still a Democrat, served as the chairperson of the boundaries committee and also served on the committee responsible for matters concerning the legislature. The convention finished on September 18, 1857, and submitted the finished document to a vote of the public on November 9. This vote approved the Constitution and on February 14, 1859, Oregon entered the Union as the 33rd state.


== Later life and legacy ==

In his later years he was involved in a variety of business ventures in Oregon, including as a major shareholder in the Oregon Telegraph newspaper and vice-president of the Willamette Steam Navigation Company.  He served on the Portland Public Schools board from 1868-1871. Lovejoy died on September 10, 1882, at the age of 74 and was buried in the Masonic section at Lone Fir Cemetery in Portland. Lovejoy Street in Portland is named after him, and the character Reverend Timothy Lovejoy in The Simpsons is named after this street. The fountain at Lovejoy Fountain Park in downtown Portland is named in his honor.

Tan Ping Koon,"Tan Ping Koon (陈平坤 Chén Píngkūn; born 1968) is a Singaporean man who, together with Chua Ser Lien, was charged for the kidnapping of a seven-year-old girl for ransom during Christmas Day of 2003. Tan, who was the owner and manager of a transportation company, had several financial troubles and thus it led to both Tan and Chua to decide to kidnap a child of a wealthy businessman for ransom. The men also demanded a ransom of S$1 million before settling on the final sum of S$70,000 through negotiations. Two days after the crime, both Chua and Tan were arrested and brought to trial for kidnapping for ransom, and after they pleaded guilty to committing the crime, both men were each sentenced to life at Changi Prison and three strokes of the cane by High Court judge Tay Yong Kwang on 9 September 2004.


== Personal life ==
Born in 1968, Tan Ping Koon had at least one sibling - a younger sister - in his family. He later established a transportation company and became its transport manager. He later married, and had one daughter who was born in 1994 or 1995.
By July 2003, Tan's wife separated from him, and she left both Tan and their daughter, who continued staying at her father's Tampines flat. The reason for her separation was due to her husband's gambling addiction, and it caused him to rake up huge debts. Despite selling off the flat to pay his debts, Tan remained incorrigible and persisted in his gambling habits, which caused his wife to live separately from him. By December 2003, Tan had a debt totalling up to S$500,000, and he even ran off to Malaysia at one point to hide from loan sharks, but he returned for fear of leaving his daughter alone without care or safety in Singapore. Tan's company was also plunged into a precarious financial situation as well.


== Criminal conduct ==

In early December 2003, Tan Ping Koon, then 35 years old, met up with his friend Chua Ser Lien (whom he knew for seven years) to talk about his financial troubles. Like Tan, Chua, then a 42-year-old cleaning company owner married with two sons, was also heavily in debt, as he owed about S$600,000 to his creditors. Both men, after some talk, decided that in order to solve their debts, they had to kidnap someone for ransom. They researched on potential targets from the list of businesses they obtained, and selected one of the companies' managing director, who was a former business partner of Chua's childhood friend and thought of kidnapping one of the director's children to extort a S$2 million ransom from him. The men initially thought of trafficking drugs but decided to abort the plan in favour of kidnapping, and they also hoped that if they won lottery, they would call off the kidnap plan, but they did not.After a week of planning, on 25 December 2003, coincidentally Christmas Day, Tan and Chua drove their getaway car (with false license plate numbers) to the man's home at Yio Chu Kang to execute their kidnap plan. As the house gates were still open, and the people at the house were busy preparing for a Christmas party and buffet dinner, Chua decided to enter the house without anyone knowing, and wore a mask to disguise himself. He managed to abduct one of the director's children, a seven-year-old girl, from the living room and quickly ran off to the car with the girl. Tan, who was the driver, drove off upon Chua entering their vehicle. However, the abduction was witnessed by the girl's brothers and a catering assistant, who took down the license plate number and asked her husband to follow the car. After the men drove for thirty minutes, they spotted the husband tailing them from behind, and thus released the girl at the side of the road in Tampines. The girl, who was not harmed or gagged, was taken back home, and the mother contacted the police.Despite their failure, Tan and Chua decided to contact the girl's father the next day, asking for a ransom of S$1 million. They threatened to endanger the safety of the father and the girl if he did not pay up on time. The father, who reported the matter to the police, decided to play along with the men's request (as instructed by the police) and he later negotiated with the men to pay a ransom of S$70,000. On 27 December 2003, two days after the kidnapping, the men eventually received the ransom at their pick-up point at Pan Island Expressway, and they were arrested shortly after at Tampines by the police, who tailed them from the pick-up point and monitored their movements all the while.After their arrests, Tan and Chua were charged with kidnapping for ransom, a crime which is punishable by death or life imprisonment with/without caning.


== Court proceedings and aftermath ==


=== Trial and guilty plea ===

On 6 September 2004, 35-year-old Tan Ping Koon and 42-year-old Chua Ser Lien stood trial at the High Court for the kidnapping of the seven-year-old girl. In his trial, Tan was represented by Subhas Anandan, then the most famous criminal lawyer in Singapore, who was known for representing notorious criminals like Anthony Ler (who manipulated a 15-year-old student to murder his wife) in several high-profile cases. Chua, on the other hand, was represented by another lawyer named Lee Teck Leng in both his and Tan's joint trial. Both men initially submitted there was no case to answer since during the abduction of the child, they did not demand for ransom despite having the intention to. After a discussion with their lawyers, both Tan and Chua changed their minds and decided to plead guilty.In his submissions, Anandan argued that Tan should not be sentenced to death (the maximum punishment for kidnapping), and he instead submitted that Tan should be given a life sentence for his crime. He argued that both his client and Chua should be regarded as having pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity as they did not do so on the first day of trial only because of the then unresolved legal issue, and their decision to plead guilty had spared the girl the need to recount her traumatic experience on the stand.Anandan also added that the kidnapping was committed by Tan out of desperation to pay his debts and recounted his personal background, and submitted the psychiatrist Dr Gwee Kok Peng's diagnosis report (dated March 2004) to highlight Tan's psychiatric state. While in remand, Dr Gwee found that at the time of the offence, Tan had depression, epilepsy and low IQ, and these were severe enough to impair his judgement and led to more difficulty on Tan's part to manage his stressors, and should Tan receive proper care and treatment while in prison, he would recover. In Dr Gwee's words, he made a conclusion on Tan's psychiatric state, ""Given his low intelligence, poor verbal reasoning, planning difficulties and concrete thinking, he had difficulty coping with the multiple stressors at the time. Adding that to the hopelessness aggravated by his depression, he tended to resort to desperate, short-sighted measures."" From this, Anandan sought mercy for Tan and asked that he should not receive caning due to the victim's lack of injury and the relatively short period of time the girl was held hostage.Chua's defence counsel also took a similar defence strategy to plead to the trial court to spare Chua from the death penalty on account of his severe bipolar disorder symptoms and various extenuating circumstances in his case.


=== Sentence and imprisonment ===

On 9 September 2004, the trial judge Tay Yong Kwang of the High Court sentenced both Tan and Chua to life imprisonment and three strokes of the cane each. Justice Tay accepted the men's psychiatric reports and expressed sympathy for their financial troubles, but he nonetheless criticized the men for targeting a child and stated that both defendants, who were parents themselves, should understand more than anyone the grief of any parent whose child goes missing. Justice Tay also pointed out that while the men did release the girl shortly after the abduction, they did it not out of a change of heart but due to their ""sheer hard luck"", and they tried to extort money from the family under threats of their safety despite the failure. Justice Tay also found there was meticulous planning made by both men (especially Chua, the ""more brainy one"" in Justice Tay's words) to commit the crime since they discussed it for over a week and look for the right timing to strike. Still, Justice Tay refrained from imposing the death sentence given both defendants' respective mental disorders and the lack of weapons and no harm was done to the girl during the kidnapping, and thus decided that it was sufficient to punish the men with life terms and caning of three strokes to ""convey the message that kidnapping, especially of vulnerable victims, is likely to be visited with painful consequences."" The passers-by who helped the girl and the police were all commended for their efforts to help the girl and ensuring the kidnappers be caught within a short period of time.Before they were led away from the courtroom, Tan was allowed to speak to his daughter and younger sister, and he cried as he conversed with the two of them, while Chua, who had only one relative appearing in court, remained silent and calm during and after sentencing. When she was interviewed, Tan's estranged wife commented that if only her husband did not gamble, he would not have became heavily in debt and ended up having to serve his time in jail for the rest of his life. Tan, whose sentence was backdated to the date of his capture (27 December 2003), is currently serving his sentence at Changi Prison. If he served with good behaviour, it is possible that Tan, after serving at least twenty years of his sentence, can be released on parole should he reached the conditions for eligibility.
During his time of imprisonment, Tan's case was re-adapted by Singaporean crime show Singaporean crime show Crimewatch, airing as the ninth episode of the show's annual season in 2004 (the year he was sentenced). Also, during the 17th year mark of Tan's sentence, Chua died at the age of 58 due to suicide in July 2020, leaving Tan the only one of the kidnappers who remained alive while in prison; it was not known how Tan, then 51 or 52 years old, reacted to the death of his old friend.

Garden Mountain Cluster,"The Garden Mountain Cluster is a region in the Jefferson National Forest recognized by The Wilderness Society for its diversity of habitats extending along the east, south and west of Burke's Garden. The cluster, part of the Appalachian Mountains in southwest Virginia, connects wildlands in the high country of Garden Mountain and adjacent streams and ridges in one of the most remote areas of Virginia.


== Description ==
The Garden Mountain Cluster contains seven wildlands with different degrees of protection: wilderness areas, a study area and two areas recognized by the Wilderness Society as ""Mountain Treasures"", areas that are worthy of protection from logging and road construction.The areas in the cluster are:

Wilderness Areas
Hunting Camp Creek Wilderness
Garden Mountain Wilderness
Beartown Wilderness
Study Areas
Lynn Camp Creek Wilderness Study Area
Wild areas recognized by the Wilderness Society as ""Mountain Treasures""
Beartown Wilderness Addition A
Beartown Wilderness Addition B


== Location and access ==

The cluster extends around the western, southern and eastern sides of Burke's Garden. VA 16, on the southern side, and VA 42, on the eastern side, intersect with roads leading into the cluster. Access from Burke's Garden is somewhat restricted because of the steep rise of the slopes around the bowl forming the garden.
The Appalachian Trail passes through the full length of the cluster for 26.6 miles.  From north to south, the trail crosses Va 615, Suiter Road, to enter the cluster at Hunting Camp Creek Wilderness.  The trail climbs Brushy Mountain, then descends to cross Hunting Camp Creek, passes by Jenkins Shelter, climbs Garden Mountain, continues along the ridge of Garden Mountain with views of Burke's Garden, passes by Davis Farm Campsite, and crosses Va 623.  The trail then enters Garden Mountain Wilderness continuing along the ridge of Garden Mountain. After leaving Garden Mountain Wilderness, the trail passes by Chestnut Ridge Shelter, goes along the boundary of Beartown Wilderness then turns south, descends through Beartown Wilderness Addition B,  crosses USFS road 222, Poor Valley Road, to reach Lick Creek.  Now the trail enters Lynn Camp Creek Wilderness Study Area, crosses over Lynn Camp Mountain reaching Lynn Camp Creek, then ascends Brushy Mountain passing Knot Maul Branch Shelter before descending to VA 42 to exit the cluster at the boundary of the wilderness study area.Roads and trails in the cluster are shown on National Geographic Map 787 (Blacksburg, New River Valley). A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wild land's coordinates in the upper right of this page.


== Biological significance ==
The land form, climate, soils and geology of the Appalachian highlands, as well as its evolutionary history, have created one of the most diverse collection of plants and animals in the deciduous forests of the temperate world. The cluster's large tract of land supports species, such as black bear and some bird species, that require extensive tracts of unbroken forest for survival.The cluster provides habitat and watershed for species that are critically imperiled (G1), imperiled (G2) or vulnerable (G3), as indicated by their NatureServe conservation status. The Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation, Natural Heritage Program gives a list of these species for the counties included in the cluster, Bland, Smyth and Wythe. Among these are:

== Geologic history ==
The cluster is in the Ridge and Valley Province that extends along the western boundary of Virginia. The Ridge and Valley Province is composed of long, relatively level-crested, ridges with highest elevations reaching over 3,600 feet (1,100 m). The province marks the eastern boundary in the Paleozoic era of an older land surface on the east. It was uplifted and eroded during the Paleozoic with extensive folding and thrust-faulting. Resistant quartzite, conglomerates and sandstones form the ridge caps while less resistant shales and limestones eroded to form the intervening valleys.: 60  The province is part of the Appalachian Mountains.
Garden Mountain extends from Abingdon to the New River, where the ridge of Garden Mountain continues across the river but is now named Sinking Creek Mountain. The mountain completely surrounds Burkes Garden, an unusual geologic formation. From above Burke's Garden looks like the remnant of a volcano or a large lake. It is about 10 miles long and 5 miles wide (16 × 8 km). Called the Great Swamp by Native Americans, it was probably too wet for crops. There are several proposals about its creation. One claims the valley was a lake drained by a creek, Burke's Garden Creek, flowing through the gap on the western edge. Another claims it was a 6,500-foot (2,000 m) dome formed by a sandstone cap. Eroded by water, the cap cracked forming a flat valley below.The Tennessee Valley Divide passes through the cluster along the southern rim of Burke's Garden, dividing the drainage for the Tennessee River and the New River.  Roaring Fork, Lick Creek and Lynn Camp Creek, on the southwest, flow into the North Holston River which then flows into the Tennessee.  Hunting Camp Creek, on the northeast, is part of the New River drainage.  Both the New River and Tennessee River flow into the Ohio River.


== Cultural history ==
According to legend, Burke's Garden was discovered in about 1748 by James Burk while chasing a wounded elk. After eating some potatoes, he covered the peelings with dirt in order to hide his presence from Indians. Later explorers, finding a large patch of potatoes that had sprouted from the peelings, named the place as ""Burk's Garden"". The ""e"" on the end of the name was added at a later time. The area was settled by German Lutherans who were so attached to the area that they refused to sell their land to George Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt, looking for a place to build a home, moved to North Carolina where he built the largest private home in America, the Biltmore Estate.Tazewell, the largest town near the cluster and the seat of Tazewell County, has served as the financial center for the agricultural and coal mining interests in the region. Evidence of prosperity is given by the large homes built on several hills. The town was incorporated in 1866. The county was named for Henry Tazewell, who served from 1794 to 1799 as a United States senator.

Hulme Locks Branch Canal,"The Hulme Locks Branch Canal is a canal in the city of Manchester.  It is 200m (one furlong) in length and was built to provide a direct waterway between the Mersey and Irwell Navigation and the Bridgewater Canal.  The canal opened in 1838 and was superseded in 1995 by a new lock at Pomona Dock 3. As both of its locks remain closed, the canal is now overgrown.


== History ==
The lack of any direct canal link between the Mersey and Irwell Navigation (M&IN) and the Rochdale Canal meant that goods being transported using both waterways had to be offloaded onto carts and carried across the city, before being loaded back onto boats to continue their journey.  This was costly and time-consuming, as well as adding to traffic congestion on the streets of Manchester.
In 1799 the nearby Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal company (MB&B) proposed to connect their canal to the Rochdale canal with an aqueduct across the M&IN.  Due mainly to strong objections from the M&IN, who would have suffered a loss of trade, the link was not forthcoming. In 1805, John Nightingale was asked by the Mersey and Irwell Navigation Company to estimate the cost of a canal link between Manchester and Salford. Nothing would happen until 1836, when John Gilbert was appointed as engineer.
The Bridgewater Canal Company sensing potential loss of trade cut the short Hulme Locks Branch Canal connecting their canal to the River Irwell. The following year the M&IN completed the Manchester and Salford Junction Canal.  This provided an alternative route from the Rochdale Canal to the River Irwell, and cargoes from either direction could navigate onto the Irwell using the junction canal or Hulme Locks.


== Decline ==
The canals were constructed just as railways were becoming popular but the railways had little effect on Bridgewater Canal traffic.  In later years, both the Bridgewater Canal and River Irwell came to be owned by the Manchester Ship Canal Company, removing the competitive incentive for keeping both canals open and the Junction Canal was abandoned in 1922. Hulme Locks Branch Canal was used until 1995, when a new lock was provided at Pomona Docks (Dock 3), and this branch canal is now overgrown.
There were originally three locks on the Hulme Locks Branch but because of the large amount of barge traffic carrying maize from ships in Salford Docks to Kelloggs factory in Trafford Park, improvements were made to the Bridgewater Canal in the 1950s and 60s which included changing the three locks to one single deep lock. This happened in 1962. The canal was also deepened between here and the Kelloggs factory so that the barges could carry greater payloads. A new fleet of steel barges was built in the late 1940s and early '50s, principally to carry the Kelloggs traffic. This traffic ceased in 1974, because Kelloggs were finding it increasingly difficult to find suitable ships to bring the maize from Canada that were small enough to use the Ship Canal so they built a new mill at Liverpool.

Norman Schwarzkopf Jr.,"Herbert Norman Schwarzkopf Jr.  (, German: [ˈʃvartskɔp͡f]; August 22, 1934 – December 27, 2012) was a United States Army general. While serving as the commander of United States Central Command, he led all coalition forces in the Gulf War against Ba'athist Iraq.
Born in Trenton, New Jersey, Schwarzkopf grew up in the United States and later in Iran. He was accepted by the United States Military Academy and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army in 1956. After a number of initial training programs, Schwarzkopf interrupted a stint as an academy teacher and served in the Vietnam War, first as an adviser to the South Vietnamese Army and then as a battalion commander. Schwarzkopf was highly decorated in Vietnam and was awarded three Silver Stars, two Purple Hearts, and the Legion of Merit. Rising through the ranks after the Vietnam war, he later commanded the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division and was one of the commanders of the invasion of Grenada in 1983.
Assuming command of United States Central Command in 1988, Schwarzkopf was called on to respond to the invasion of Kuwait in 1990 by the forces of Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Initially tasked with defending Saudi Arabia from Iraqi aggression, Schwarzkopf's command eventually grew to an international force of over 750,000 troops. After diplomatic relations broke down, he planned and led Operation Desert Storm, an extended air campaign followed by a highly successful 100-hour ground offensive, which defeated the Iraqi Army and removed Iraqi troops from Kuwait in early 1991. Schwarzkopf was presented with military honors.
Schwarzkopf retired shortly after the end of the war and undertook a number of philanthropic ventures, only occasionally stepping into the political spotlight before his death from complications of pneumonia. A hard-driving military commander, easily angered, Schwarzkopf was considered an exceptional leader by many biographers and was noted for his abilities as a military diplomat and in dealing with the press.


== Early life and education ==
Schwarzkopf was born Herbert Norman Schwarzkopf Jr. on August 22, 1934, in Trenton, New Jersey, to Herbert Norman Schwarzkopf Sr. and Ruth Alice (née Bowman). His father was a 1917 graduate of the United States Military Academy and veteran of World War I. His mother was a housewife from West Virginia who was distantly related to Thomas Jefferson. The senior Schwarzkopf later became the founding Superintendent of the New Jersey State Police, where he worked as a lead investigator on the 1932 Lindbergh baby kidnapping case. In January 1952, the younger Schwarzkopf's birth certificate was amended to make his name ""H. Norman Schwarzkopf"", reportedly because his father detested his first name. The younger Schwarzkopf had two elder sisters, Ruth Ann (a civil rights and antiwar activist) and Sally Joan.
Norman Schwarzkopf was described by childhood friends as active and assertive, protective of his sisters and a skilled athlete. He spent his childhood attached to his father, who subsequently became the narrator for the Gang Busters radio program. When Norman Schwarzkopf was eight years old, his father returned to the military amid World War II. His continuous absence made home life difficult, particularly for his wife. As a 10-year-old cadet at Bordentown Military Institute, near Trenton, he posed for his official photograph wearing a stern expression because, as he said afterwards, ""Some day when I become a general, I want people to know that I'm serious.""
In 1946, when Norman Schwarzkopf was 12, he moved with his father to Tehran, Iran. In Iran, he learned shooting, horseback riding, and hunting. Schwarzkopf developed a lifelong interest in Middle Eastern culture. The family moved to Geneva, Switzerland, in 1947, following a new military assignment for Herbert Schwarzkopf. The senior Schwarzkopf visited Italy, Heidelberg, Frankfurt, and Berlin, Germany during his military duties, and the younger Schwarzkopf accompanied him. By 1951 he had returned to Iran briefly before returning to the United States. Herbert Schwarzkopf died in 1958. From a young age, Norman wanted to be a military officer, following his father's example.He attended the Community High School in Tehran, later the International School of Geneva, and briefly Frankfurt American High School in Frankfurt, Germany (1948–49), and Heidelberg American High School in Heidelberg, Germany (1949–50). He eventually graduated from Valley Forge Military Academy in 1952. He was also a member of Mensa. Schwarzkopf graduated valedictorian out of his class of 150, and his IQ was tested at 168. Schwarzkopf then attended the United States Military Academy where he played football, wrestled, sang and conducted the West Point Chapel choir. His large frame (6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m) in height and 240 pounds (110 kg) in weight) was advantageous in athletics.In his plebe year, he was given the nickname ""Schwarzie"", the same as his father, and he was often pushed by older cadets to imitate his father's radio show as a traditional act of hazing. Schwarzkopf gained great respect for certain military leaders at West Point, notably Ulysses S. Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman and Creighton Abrams, believing them to be excellent commanders who nonetheless did not glorify war. He graduated 43rd of 480 in the class of 1956 with a Bachelor of Science degree. Later, Schwarzkopf earned a Masters of Engineering at the University of Southern California.[1] 


== Career ==


=== Junior officer ===
Commissioned into the Army as an Infantry second lieutenant, Schwarzkopf reported to the United States Army Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia, where he attended the Infantry Officer Basic Course and earned his Parachutist Badge from October 1956 to March 1957. His first assignment was as a platoon leader and later executive officer of E Company, 2nd Airborne Battle Group, 187th Airborne Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. He later recounted that it was then that he found chronic problems in military leadership, amid what historians have called a larger doctrinal crisis. Schwarzkopf later said there were many officers and NCOs he met on that assignment who ""had no sense of duty or honor, and who saw the world through an alcoholic haze.""He was promoted to first lieutenant in 1958. In July 1959, Schwarzkopf was assigned his first overseas assignment. He was a staff officer alternating with duties as a platoon leader, liaison officer, and reconnaissance platoon leader with the 6th Infantry Regiment in West Germany. In July 1960, Schwarzkopf was assigned as aide-de-camp to Brigadier General Charles Johnson who commanded the Berlin Brigade in West Berlin.Schwarzkopf was promoted to captain in July 1961 and attended the Advanced Infantry School at Fort Benning for eight months and qualified for the Master Parachutist Badge. In June 1962, Schwarzkopf enrolled at the University of Southern California in a Master of Science in Engineering course studying missile mechanics. He graduated in June 1964 with a Master of Science in mechanical and aerospace engineering. He then returned to West Point to serve an obligatory tour as an instructor in the Department of Mechanics. He was assigned to teach at the Military Academy for three years, but after a year he volunteered for service in South Vietnam for faster career advancement with a combat tour. West Point approved his request in early 1965, stipulating that he would return and complete his remaining obligation afterwards.


=== Vietnam War ===
In the Vietnam War, Schwarzkopf served as a task force adviser to the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Airborne Division. He was promoted to major shortly after arriving in Vietnam. After an initial orientation at Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), headquartered in Saigon, Schwarzkopf was sent north to Pleiku in the central highlands, in the II Corps Tactical Zone. He got his first combat experience on August 3, when he was the senior adviser to a force of 1,000 South Vietnamese paratroopers sent to relieve a beleaguered South Vietnamese Army force at Đức Cơ Camp. The paratroopers took heavy casualties and a second, larger force was required to relieve them. That force too came into heavy contact. Schwarzkopf and his group fought continuously for several days. At one point, he braved heavy North Vietnamese fire to recover and treat a handful of wounded South Vietnamese soldiers and escort them to safety.By August 17, the 173rd Airborne Brigade arrived and broke the siege, ending the Battle of Đức Cơ. General William Westmoreland later arrived to review the battle and congratulate Schwarzkopf. For his leadership in the battle, Schwarzkopf was awarded the Silver Star. On February 14, 1966, Schwarzkopf led an ARVN paratrooper assault on a Viet Cong position, during which he was wounded four times by small arms fire. However, he refused medical evacuation or to relinquish command until the objective had been captured and so he was awarded a second Silver Star and a Purple Heart.After ten months of combat duty, Schwarzkopf was pulled from the front by MACV and reassigned as senior staff adviser for civil affairs to the ARVN Airborne Division. He returned to the United States and finished his teaching assignment at West Point where he was an associate professor in the Department of Mechanics. In 1968 he attended the Army's Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, completing the course in June 1969. During this time he met Brenda Holsinger, a flight attendant for Trans World Airlines. They were introduced at a West Point football game in 1967 and married the next year. The couple would later have three children: Cynthia, born in 1970; Jessica, born in 1972; and Christian, born in 1977.In 1969, Schwarzkopf was promoted to lieutenant colonel and ordered to a second tour in Vietnam, leaving in June. He was assigned as executive officer to the chief of staff at MACV headquarters based at Tan Son Nhut Air Base in Saigon. Schwarzkopf later recalled this second tour of duty was very different from his first. There were now 500,000 U.S. troops in Vietnam, the strategy of Vietnamization was in full effect, and recent events such as the Tet Offensive and My Lai Massacre had put U.S. combat troops under increased political scrutiny. In December 1969, he got his first field command, taking over the 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry, 198th Infantry Brigade at Chu Lai. He later said that the troops were initially demoralized and in poor condition, racked with rampant drug use and disciplinary problems as well as a lack of support from home.Despite the brigade's otherwise-controversial performance record, Schwarzkopf was quickly regarded as one of its best combat commanders. He aggressively stepped up patrols and operations to counter Viet Cong infiltration in the battalion's sector. He developed his leadership attitudes during this command. Fellow commander Hal Moore later wrote that during his time in Vietnam, Schwarzkopf acquired his well-known short temper, and argued via radio for passing American helicopters to land and pick up his wounded men. He also showed a preference of leading from the front and prided himself on avoiding the rear areas, which he termed a ""cesspool"".During this second tour, Schwarzkopf noted two incidents that haunted him. On February 17, 1970, two men in C Company, 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry were killed by friendly fire from an American artillery shell that had been called in by Schwarzkopf but had struck a tree near their position on its way to a target. The parents of one soldier blamed him for the death of their son, a claim that Schwarzkopf strongly denied and termed an accident of war. On May 28, 1970, Schwarzkopf landed his helicopter when discovering troops of B Company who had stumbled into a minefield. Two company officers had been wounded and two soldiers were trapped, fearful of setting off more mines. Although a medevac was on its way, Schwarzkopf ordered his UH-1 Huey to remove the wounded. As he attempted to help the troops back out of the field, one soldier struck a landmine, breaking a leg, and began to panic. Fearing that he would set off another landmine, Schwarzkopf pinned the soldier to the ground while another soldier put a splint on the wounded man's leg. In doing so, another mine was set off, killing three and wounding Schwarzkopf's artillery officer.Returning to the United States in 1970, Schwarzkopf was awarded a third Silver Star and a second Purple Heart for risking his life to protect the soldiers, as well as three Bronze Star Medals and a Legion of Merit for his command performance. Still, his experiences in Vietnam embittered him to foreign policy. Upon returning to the United States, he spoke of a wariness of future conflicts to author C. D. B. Bryan in 1971. He related those experiences under his real name, which was changed to Lieutenant Colonel Byron Schindler for the made for TV movie Friendly Fire in 1979.
I don't think there will ever be another major confrontation where the armies line up on both sides. If that happens, it's inevitably going to be nuclear weapons and the whole thing. So I think all wars of the future are going to be—and again, God forbid, I hope we don't have any. War is a profanity, it really is. It's terrifying. Nobody is more anti-war than an intelligent person who's been to war. Probably the most anti-war people I know are Army officers—but if we do have a war, I think it's going to be limited in nature like Vietnam and Korea. Limited in scope. And when they get ready to send me again, I'm going to have to stop and ask myself, ""is it worth it?"" That's a very dangerous place for the nation to be when your own army is going to stop and question. 


=== Rise to General ===
Disgruntled by the treatment of Vietnam veterans in the United States after the war, Schwarzkopf considered leaving the military but ultimately decided to stay in the hope of fixing some of the problems encountered by the military during the war. He underwent surgery at Walter Reed Army Hospital shortly after his return from Vietnam to repair longstanding back problems exacerbated by parachute jumps.Between 1970 and 1983, Schwarzkopf took on a number of different assignments. Promoted to colonel, Schwarzkopf volunteered for an assignment in Alaska, and in late 1974 became deputy commander of the 172nd Infantry Brigade at Fort Richardson, Alaska. In 1975, Col Schwarzkopf served as Commander of Troop E, 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment, at Fort Wainwright, AK.  Subsequently, in  October 1976, he moved to Fort Lewis, Washington, to command the 1st Brigade of the 9th Infantry Division, where he impressed his division commander, Major General Richard E. Cavazos. The two frequently hunted together and developed a close friendship. Having been very successful in improving the combat readiness of the 1st Brigade, he was nominated to receive his first star as a brigadier general. His promotion ceremony occurred at Fort Lewis shortly after he had relinquished command of the brigade.In July 1978, Schwarzkopf became deputy director of plans at the U.S. Pacific Command in Hawaii. He then served a two-year stint as assistant division commander of the 8th Infantry Division (Mechanized) in Germany. He returned to Washington, DC, for an assignment as director of personnel management for the Army, subordinate to the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, General Maxwell R. Thurman. Schwarzkopf was promoted to major general. In June 1983, he became commanding general of the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) at Fort Stewart, Georgia. He immediately established an extremely rigorous training regimen and became well known among the troops of the command for his strict training and aggressive personality.On October 25, 1983, Schwarzkopf was appointed to the command group for the Invasion of Grenada. He was the chief army adviser to the overall operation commander, Vice Admiral Joseph Metcalf III, Commander, United States Second Fleet/Commander Joint Task Force 120. The operation was plagued by logistical difficulties, exacerbated by poor communication and lack of co-operation between the branches of the United States military. Schwarzkopf was named deputy commander of the invasion at the last minute, leaving him with little say in the planning. Schwarzkopf helped lead the initial landing operations while he was aboard USS Guam. He was involved in an incident where the colonel commanding the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit initially refused to fly Army troops in Marine helicopters.He flew into St. George's on the second day of the operation. While he initially did not think the US should have been involved in the conflict, he later said he considered the mission a success because it reasserted the dominance of the US military after the Vietnam War. Following the invasion, Schwarzkopf returned to the 24th Infantry Division and completed his tour as its commander. He was then among the leaders who were criticized for the poor interservice co-operation in the operation, particularly the poor communication between forces of the different branches in combat. The operation was a learning experience for Schwarzkopf, who saw the need to develop greater co-operation between the services for future joint operations. He would later push for more policies to make joint warfare, and interservice co-operation standard practice in warfare. Specifically, the operation demonstrated a need for greater joint roles in planning, deploying troops, and communicating operations. Subsequent operations gave more authority to joint commanders in operations and doctrine and emphasized joint warfare doctrine over service-centered doctrine.In July 1985, Schwarzkopf began an 11-month assignment as Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans at the Pentagon. On July 1, 1986, he was promoted to lieutenant general, and was reassigned to Fort Lewis as commander of I Corps. He held the post for 14 months before returning to the Pentagon as Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans in August 1987. In a second role, Schwarzkopf served as the Army's senior member on the Military Staff Committee at the United Nations Security Council, where he began to build diplomatic skills in dealings with representatives from other countries. As a part of his duties during the posting, he sat in on arms reduction talks with leaders from the Soviet Union.


==== CENTCOM commander ====
In November 1988, Schwarzkopf was named commander of United States Central Command (CENTCOM), succeeding General George B. Crist. Schwarzkopf was selected over a more popular choice, Vice Admiral Henry C. Mustin because commanders considered him an accomplished strategic thinker who had experience both in combat and with diplomacy and had great knowledge of the Middle East from his childhood experiences there. He assumed command of CENTCOM, with his headquarters at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida, and was promoted to general. At the time of this appointment, CENTCOM had overall responsibility for U.S. military operations in 19 countries, and had 200,000 service members on call should a crisis arise. Schwarzkopf immediately took to changing the focus of the command, which had focused on the ""Zagros Doctrine,"" a hypothetical ground invasion by the Soviet Union through the Zagros Mountains, which the US would counter in Iran. Schwarzkopf was more concerned with the effects of the Iran–Iraq War on the stability of the region than of an external threat posed by the Soviet Union.In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee in March 1989, Schwarzkopf maintained that the Soviet Union was a threat to the region, but when giving an overview of the countries in the region, he noted that Iraq posed a threat to its weaker neighbors. He implored for the US to ""seek to assert a moderating influence in Iraq."" With regional turmoil growing, Schwarzkopf became concerned about the threat posed by Saddam Hussein, focusing the attention of his command on preparing to respond to what he thought was a ""more realistic scenario."" That year, his command began planning to counter an Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, seeing it as a likely conflict that would threaten the interests of the United States.
In early 1990, he testified again before the Senate Armed Services Committee in threat-assessment hearings that the Cold War was ending and that it was less likely the Soviet Union would exert military force in the region. Though he declined to identify Iraq specifically as a threat, he noted a regional conflict was the most likely event to destabilize the region and that noted Iraq's ceasefire with Iran meant it was continuing to grow and modernize its military. In early 1990, he drafted a war plan, Operations Plan 1002-90, titled ""Defense of the Arabian Peninsula,"" which envisioned an Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia through Kuwait.During CENTCOM military exercises in July 1990, termed Internal Look '90, Schwarzkopf wrote a scenario that tested how the command would respond to a regional dictator invading a neighboring country and threatening oilfields there, which closely mirrored the rising tension between Iraq and Kuwait. One week after the end of the exercises, Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 2, 1990.


=== Gulf War ===

Initially believing that the Iraqi Army would advance only to the Rumailah oil field, Schwarzkopf was surprised when the Iraqis captured Kuwait City. Fearing Iraq would next invade Saudi Arabia, Schwarzkopf ordered contingency plans put in motion, with the 82nd Airborne Division, 101st Airborne Division and 24th Infantry Division put on alert. He was then called to an emergency meeting with US President George H. W. Bush, where his Internal Look '90 command post wargame was made the basis of a potential counteroffensive plan. By August 5, Bush opted for an aggressive response to the invasion. Schwarzkopf then accompanied Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney to meet with Saudi King Fahd to convince him to allow U.S. troops into Saudi Arabia to counter the Iraqi military.With Fahd's consent, Bush ordered troops into Saudi Arabia on August 7, initially tasked to defend Saudi Arabia should Iraq attack. U.S. commanders from the beginning wanted a quick conflict characterized by decisive, overwhelming force, as opposed to the gradual escalation of U.S. involvement as had been seen in Vietnam. Schwarzkopf in particular was adamant to avoid repeating many of the policies governing military operations in Vietnam, especially the slow escalation of air power and troop forces. His plan for direct and overwhelming force was initially criticized in Washington as uncreative. By August 13, the news media began to closely cover Schwarzkopf, who had been named to lead the operation.


==== Operation Desert Shield ====
From his headquarters in Tampa, Schwarzkopf began planning the operations to defend Saudi Arabia. Lieutenant General Charles Horner, USAF, ran the headquarters in Riyadh. Schwarzkopf planned supply lines for the 50,000 troops initially sent to Saudi Arabia, tapping Major General William G. Pagonis as director of the logistical operations, with US Air Force cargo aircraft landing supplies at Dhahran and US Navy ships offloading troops and supplies at Dammam. By August 20, 20,000 U.S. troops were in Saudi Arabia, with another 80,000 preparing to deploy, and a further 40,000 reserves tapped to augment them. Schwarzkopf arrived at the CENTCOM command in Riyadh on August 25, and on August 29, he conducted his first front-line tour of the potential combat zone, accompanied by reporters.
Over the next several weeks, Schwarzkopf spoke frequently with both reporters and troops under his command, conducting many high-profile press conferences and updates to the situation in Saudi Arabia. Schwarzkopf worked to help coordinate the contributions of the different nations contributing military forces to the effort. By mid-October, Schwarzkopf indicated he was confident the forces were of a sufficient level that they could defend Saudi Arabia if it was attacked. Through October, Schwarzkopf and his command were occupied with setting up facilities and supply lines for the troops streaming into Saudi Arabia. He also worked to minimize the culture clash among foreigners in sharia-dominated Saudi Arabia such as the high visibility of women in military roles. Schwarzkopf remained at his command in Riyadh until December and made frequent frontline visits to the troops. On December 29, 1990, he received a warning order from the Pentagon to be ready to attack into Iraq and Kuwait by January 17.
Initially, Operation Desert Shield involved a sea interdiction campaign that saw international warships detaining and inspecting tankers from Iraq. As the buildup continued, Schwarzkopf was occupied with planning an offensive operation against the Iraqi units along the border, sometimes working 18-hour days in planning, closely assisted by a group of aides. He frequently met with subordinates and Saudi commanders. Schwarzkopf planned counters for Iraq's large armored forces, air forces, and elite Republican Guard forces. While planning, Schwarzkopf remained in frequent contact with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Colin Powell (also a Vietnam veteran) concerning Schwarzkopf's plans for the offensive.Schwarzkopf devised an operational plan, dubbed ""Operation Desert Storm,"" to be based on overwhelming force and strong infantry attacks supported by artillery and armor. By November 8, Bush agreed to commit 400,000 US troops to Saudi Arabia at Schwarzkopf's insistence. Schwarzkopf believed that more troops would reduce the likelihood of high casualties. He planned a strategic bombing campaign to precede an offensive into Kuwait, simultaneously striking the forward Iraqi forces and their supply lines. In the meantime, diplomatic solutions began to break down, and the deadline established by the United Nations Security Council, January 15, 1991, passed without a solution.By then, Schwarzkopf commanded an international army of 750,000, comprising 500,000 US troops and 250,000 troops from other nations, as well as thousands of main battle tanks, combat aircraft and six carrier battle groups. Most of the US and allied forces, however, were not combat veterans, and Schwarzkopf and the other allied commanders wanted to fight cautiously to minimize casualties. Schwarzkopf's experience in the Middle East allowed him to understand the factors surrounding the conflict, including the allied commanders, with greater ease. He had a good relationship with Saudi commander Khalid bin Sultan, who, in turn, helped Schwarzkopf win over the Saudi Arabian populace. In spite of the co-operation, he later said that he considered the Arab troops to be the least effective of the war.Schwarzkopf also had an agreeable relationship with his deputy commander, Lieutenant General Calvin Waller, who handled much of the administrative burden. Peter de la Billière, commander of the British contingent, and Michel Roquejeoffre, commander of the French contingent, also co-operated well with Schwarzkopf. The good relationship between the allied commanders allowed their forces to co-operate effectively during the operation.


==== Operation Desert Storm ====
The air campaign against Iraq began on January 17, 1991, after 139 days of planning and buildup. Schwarzkopf sent a prepared statement to the troops ahead of the first airstrikes, which were timed to hit their targets at 02:40. He oversaw the strikes from his war room in Riyadh, emerged from his command center late in the day on January 18 to speak to the press, and said the air war had gone ""just about exactly as we had intended it to go."" He then began making frequent briefings to the media. He declined to measure the success of the campaign by counting suspected Iraqi casualties, believing that would undermine his credibility.The air campaign proved to be a success by achieving air superiority and destroying the Iraqi military's communications network, supplies, and many tanks and armored vehicles. By January 20 he announced Iraq's nuclear test reactors had been destroyed, and by January 27 he announced that the coalition had total air superiority in Iraq. Over 38 days, the Air Force destroyed 39 percent of the T72 tanks, 32 percent of the armored personnel carriers, and 47 percent of the artillery. In the aggregate, the Air Force met the goal of 50 percent attrition of the Iraqi ground force. Bush then gave Hussein an ultimatum to withdraw from Kuwait by 12:00 on February 23 or Schwarzkopf's ground forces would attack.
Schwarzkopf began his ground campaign in earnest at 04:00 on February 24, with the Saudi-led Arab forces attacking into Kuwait City, while two US Marine Corps divisions struck at the oil fields, and the VII Corps and XVIII Airborne Corps on the left flank struck quickly to cut off the Iraqi forces from the west, which would later be known as his ""Left Hook"" strategy. Schwarzkopf expected the war to last several weeks and had anticipated chemical weapon attacks by the Iraqi forces, which did not occur. Resistance was lighter than Schwarzkopf expected, and Iraqi troops surrendered in large numbers.Within 90 hours, his force had destroyed 42 of 50 Iraqi Army divisions at a cost of about 125 killed and 200 wounded among American troops, and about 482 killed, 458 wounded among all of the coalition. He ordered his forces to destroy as much Iraqi armor and equipment as possible to ensure the weakening of Iraq's offensive capability in the near term. White House chief of staff John Sununu suggested that should the cease-fire take effect at 5 a.m. on 28 February, it would be possible to name the conflict ""The Hundred Hour War"". Powell agreed and talked with Schwarzkopf, who pointed out that it would also make it a ""Five Day War"".Schwarzkopf, who had ordered a media blackout during the ground offensive, finally appeared before journalists on February 27 to explain his strategy. On March 3, he arrived in Kuwait City to survey the aftermath of the Iraqi occupation and negotiate a ceasefire with Iraqi military leaders and to work out the return of prisoners of war on both sides. With this in place, he then began the process of overseeing U.S. troops returning from the conflict.For his services during the war, Schwarzkopf was welcomed back to America with a large parade down Broadway in New York, along with other honors.  He became the only person to receive the Distinguished Service Medal from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard.  Schwarzkopf led a highly publicized homecoming parade in Washington, DC, on June 8, 1991, where he was greeted by Bush amid thousands of onlookers. His accomplishments were praised very differently from commanders who returned from the Vietnam and Korean Wars. He became an instant national celebrity and the source of great curiosity by the general public. He was quick to award praise and medals to the troops, part of what he saw as restoring pride in the US armed forces after the Vietnam War.


== Later life ==


=== Retirement ===
Schwarzkopf returned to the United States after the Gulf War as a national hero, and his ability to effectively deal with the press left him a positive image. Schwarzkopf indicated a desire to retire from the military in mid-1991. He was initially considered for promotion alternatively to General of the Army or to Army Chief of Staff, and was ultimately asked to assume the latter post, but he declined. He was later questioned about running for political office, but, considering himself an independent, expressed little interest in doing so; ultimately denying speculation of possibly seeking the Senate seat in Florida. Schwarzkopf was not vocal about his political opinions during his military career. He retired from the military in August 1991, moving to Tampa, Florida.
Following his retirement, Schwarzkopf attained a status as celebrity, and was highly praised in the news media. He was profiled by the Associated Press, the Washington Post, Newsday, and People, as well as praised in a Random House publication on the war, Triumph in the Desert. Schwarzkopf's speaking fees topped $60,000 per public appearance.
In 1992, Schwarzkopf published a memoir, It Doesn't Take a Hero, about his life; it became a bestseller. Schwarzkopf sold the rights to his memoirs to Bantam Books for $5,000,000. In 1993, Schwarzkopf was found to have prostate cancer, for which he was successfully treated. Among the many honors he received was the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2002. Queen Elizabeth II honorarily knighted Schwarzkopf and he was awarded many other military accolades from foreign countries. He led the Pegasus Parade at the Kentucky Derby and was an honorary guest at the Indianapolis 500. He supported several children's charities and national philanthropic causes, and he was a spokesperson for prostate cancer awareness, recovery of the grizzly bear from endangered species status, and served on the Nature Conservancy board of governors. Schwarzkopf otherwise sought to live out a low-profile retirement in Tampa, though he briefly served as a military commentator for NBC.On November 7, 1994, Schwarzkopf won $14,000 for the Boggy Creek Gang on Celebrity Jeopardy!
In 2002, he was involved with an educational video game about asthma, Quest for the Code, which he launched with Steven Spielberg through the Starbright Foundation. He also voiced a character in the game.At first, Schwarzkopf was ambivalent during the run-up to the Iraq War in 2003. He initially endorsed an invasion after Colin Powell's presentation to the United Nations on February 6, 2003. When weapons of mass destruction were not located in the country after the invasion, he changed his stance. He was critical of the lack of a reconstruction plan after the fall of Baghdad, feeling the initial offensive operations plans did not take into account the cultural complexities of Iraq. In 2004, he was critical of Donald Rumsfeld and his handling of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He felt it was a mistake to send U.S. Army Reserve troops into the country without adequate training.
Schwarzkopf endorsed George W. Bush in the 2000 U.S. presidential election and the 2004 U.S. presidential election. He supported John McCain in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. He was on several occasions encouraged to run for United States Senate or President of the United States as a member of the Republican Party, but showed no interest.


=== Death ===
Schwarzkopf died at age 78 on December 27, 2012, of complications following a bout of pneumonia. A memorial service was conducted on February 28, 2013, at the Cadet Chapel at West Point, which was attended by Colin Powell, Schwarzkopf's family, and others. Schwarzkopf was cremated and his ashes were buried near those of his father in the West Point Cemetery in a ceremony attended by cadets, military leaders, New York and New Jersey State Police Troopers.Among reactions to Schwarzkopf's death, George H. W. Bush said of him: ""General Norm Schwarzkopf, to me, epitomized the 'duty, service, country' creed that has defended our freedom and seen this great Nation through our most trying international crises. More than that, he was a good and decent man and a dear friend."" In a statement, President Barack Obama said ""From his decorated service in Vietnam to the historic liberation of Kuwait and his leadership of United States Central Command, General Schwarzkopf stood tall for the country and Army he loved."" In a letter, Secretary of the Army John McHugh and Army Chief of Staff General Raymond T. Odierno wrote in a joint statement, ""Our nation owes a great debt of gratitude to General Schwarzkopf and our Soldiers will hold a special place in their hearts for this great leader. While much will be written in coming days of his many accomplishments, his most lasting and important legacies are the tremendous soldiers he trained and led.""


== Legacy ==


=== Leadership style ===
During his tour of duty in Vietnam, Schwarzkopf developed a reputation as a commander who preferred to lead from the front, even willing to risk his own life for his subordinates. His leadership style stressed preparedness, discipline and rigorous training, but also allowed his troops to enjoy the luxuries they had. In a valedictory address to West Point cadets he stressed the need for competence and character. His rehabilitation of the 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry stressed survival as well as offense. Like German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel and General George S. Patton, Schwarzkopf highly regarded decisiveness and valued determination among his commanders. He pushed for offensive combat over defensive operations in the Gulf War.He was known to be extremely critical of staff officers who were unprepared, but was even more contentious with other generals who he felt were not aggressive enough. His frequent short temper with subordinates was well known in his command. His leadership style was sometimes criticized by subordinates who felt it reduced their ability to solve problems creatively. Army Chief of Staff Carl E. Vuono, a lifelong friend of Schwarzkopf, described him as ""competent, compassionate, egotistical, loyal, opinionated, funny, emotional, sensitive to any slight. At times he can be an overbearing bastard, but not with me."" While Colin Powell would say Schwarzkopf's strengths outweighed his weaknesses, Dick Cheney personally disliked what he considered Schwarzkopf's pretentious behavior with subordinates. Cheney doubted Schwarzkopf's ability to lead the Gulf War, and so Powell dealt with Schwarzkopf instead.


=== Critiques of Gulf War leadership ===
The quick and decisive results of the Gulf War were attributed to Schwarzkopf's leadership. President Bush declared, ""Lesson number one from the Gulf War is the value of air power."" Secretary of Defense Cheney said, ""The air campaign was decisive.""Historian Rick Atkinson considered Schwarzkopf ""the most theatrical American in uniform since Douglas MacArthur."" Atkinson further contended that in his leadership during the Gulf War, Schwarzkopf conducted one of the greatest military campaigns of all time, providing the United States with its ""first battlefield hero in decades."" The later accomplishments of General Tommy Franks during Operation Enduring Freedom were compared favorably with those of Schwarzkopf. However, in an analysis of the effects of the Gulf War, several historians, including Spencer C. Tucker, contended that Schwarzkopf's ceasefire agreement allowed Iraq to continue to fly armed helicopters, which allowed it to later conduct operations against its Shia Arab and Kurdish populations. Schwarzkopf later wrote it would have been a mistake to continue the offensive and capture all of Iraq, noting that the U.S. would likely have had to pay the entire cost of rebuilding the country.Michael R. Gordon and Bernard E. Trainor wrote in their 1995 book The Generals’ War: ""Behind-the-scenes sniping continued, for the confrontation between the Army field commanders and the Air Force was not so much about the performance of airpower as the Army’s inability to control it.. As the Air Force saw it, the Gulf War was a model for future conflicts. But neither the Army nor the Marines wanted to go to war that way again.""In a 2012 book, historian Thomas E. Ricks wrote Schwarzkopf's lack of experience with politics was disadvantageous to his conduct of the war. Ricks said that Schwarzkopf was overly cautious in the execution of his plans because of his fear of repeating mistakes in Vietnam, which meant his troops failed to destroy the Iraqi Republican Guard. Ricks further criticized Schwarzkopf for failing to relieve General Frederick M. Franks Jr. as well as other subordinates who Schwarzkopf said, in his memoirs, were ineffective. Ricks concluded that the Gulf War was a ""tactical triumph but a strategic draw at best."" In his memoirs, Schwarzkopf responded to these kinds of criticisms by saying his mandate had only been to liberate and safeguard Kuwait and that an invasion of Iraq would have been highly controversial, particularly among Middle Eastern military allies.Schwarzkopf sought to change the relationship between journalists and the military, feeling that the news media's negative portrayal of the Vietnam War had degraded troops there. When he took command during the Gulf War, he sought an entirely different strategy, which was ultimately successful by favoring greater media coverage but subject to strict controls on the battlefield. Schwarzkopf favored the intense press surrounding the Gulf War conflict, feeling that blocking the news media, as had been done in Grenada, would affect public perception of the war in the United States negatively. His dealings with the press were thus frequent and very personal, and he conducted regular briefings for journalists. He would usually not attack media coverage, even if negative, unless he felt it was blatantly incorrect. He staged visible media appearances that played to patriotism.In fact, Schwarzkopf believed extensive press coverage would help build public support for the war and raise morale. In some press conferences, he showed and explained advanced war-fighting technology that the U.S. possessed to impress the public. These also had the side effect of distracting the public from focusing on U.S. casualty counts or the destruction wrought in the war. Schwarzkopf's strategy was to control the message being sent and so he ordered media on the battlefield to be escorted at all times. However, several high-profile reports publicized the CENTCOM strategy. After the war, Schwarzkopf was very critical of military analysts who scrutinized his operation, felt that some of them were poorly informed on the factors involved in his planning, and felt that others were violating operations security by revealing too much about how he might plan the operation.

Water retention curve,"Water retention curve is the relationship between the water content, θ,  and the soil water potential, ψ. This curve is characteristic for different types of soil, and is also called the soil moisture characteristic.
It is used to predict the soil water storage, water supply to the plants (field capacity) and soil aggregate stability. Due to the hysteretic effect of water filling and draining the pores, different wetting and drying curves may be distinguished.
The general features of a water retention curve can be seen in the figure, in which the volume water content, θ, is plotted against the matric potential, 
  
    
      
        
          Ψ
          
            m
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Psi _{m}}
  . At potentials close to zero, a soil is close to saturation, and water is held in the soil primarily by capillary forces. As θ decreases, binding of the water becomes stronger, and at small potentials (more negative, approaching wilting point) water is strongly bound in the smallest of pores, at contact points between grains and as films bound by adsorptive forces around particles.
Sandy soils will involve mainly capillary binding, and will therefore release most of the water at higher potentials, while clayey soils, with adhesive and osmotic binding, will release water at lower (more negative) potentials. At any given potential, peaty soils will usually display much higher moisture contents than clayey soils, which would be expected to hold more water than sandy soils. The water holding capacity of any soil is due to the porosity and the nature of the bonding in the soil.


== Curve models ==
The shape of water retention curves can be characterized by several models, one of them known as the Van Genuchten model:

   (dimensionless).Based on this parametrization a prediction model for the shape of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity - saturation - pressure relationship was developed.


== History ==
In 1907, Edgar Buckingham created the first water retention curve. It was measured and made for six soils varying in texture from sand to clay. The data came from experiments made on soil columns 48 inch tall, where a constant water level maintained about 2 inches above the bottom through periodic addition of water from a side tube. The upper ends were closed to prevent evaporation.


== Method ==
The Van Genuchten parameters (
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
   and 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  ) can be determined through field or laboratory testing. One of the methods is the instantaneous profile method, where water content 
  
    
      
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta }
   (or effective saturation 
  
    
      
        S
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle Se}
  ) are determined for a series of suction pressure measurements 
  
    
      
        ψ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \psi }
  . Due to the non-linearity of the equation, numerical techniques such as the non-linear least-squares method can be used to solve the van Genuchten parameters. The accuracy of the estimated parameters will depend on the quality of the acquired dataset (
  
    
      
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta }
   and 
  
    
      
        ψ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \psi }
  ). When water retention curves are fitted with non-linear least squares, structural overestimation or underestimation can occur. In these cases, the representation of water retention curves can be improved in terms of accuracy and uncertainty by applying Gaussian Process regression to the residuals that are obtained after non-linear least-squares. This is mostly due to the correlation between the datapoints, which is accounted for with Gaussian Process regression through the kernel function.

Homestake experiment,"The Homestake experiment (sometimes referred to as the Davis experiment or Solar Neutrino Experiment and in original literature called Brookhaven Solar Neutrino Experiment or Brookhaven 37Cl (Chlorine) Experiment ) was an experiment headed by astrophysicists Raymond Davis, Jr. and John N. Bahcall in the late 1960s. Its purpose was to collect and count neutrinos emitted by nuclear fusion taking place in the Sun. Bahcall performed the theoretical calculations and Davis designed the experiment. After Bahcall calculated the rate at which the detector should capture neutrinos, Davis's experiment turned up only one third of this figure. The experiment was the first to successfully detect and count solar neutrinos, and the discrepancy in results created the solar neutrino problem. The experiment operated continuously from 1970 until 1994. The University of Pennsylvania took it over in 1984. The discrepancy between the predicted and measured rates of neutrino detection was later found to be due to neutrino ""flavour"" oscillations.


== Methodology ==
The experiment took place in the Homestake Gold Mine in Lead, South Dakota. Davis placed a 380 cubic meter (100,000 gallon) tank of perchloroethylene, a common dry-cleaning fluid, 1,478 meters (4,850 feet) underground. A big target deep underground was needed to prevent interference from cosmic rays, taking into account the very small probability of a successful neutrino capture, and, therefore, very low effect rate even with the huge mass of the target. Perchloroethylene was chosen because it is rich in chlorine. Upon interaction with an electron neutrino, a 37Cl atom transforms into a radioactive isotope of 37Ar, which can then be extracted and counted. The reaction of the neutrino capture is

The reaction threshold is 0.814 MeV, i.e. the neutrino should have at least this energy to be captured by the 37Cl nucleus.
Because 37Ar has a half-life of 35 days, every few weeks, Davis bubbled helium through the tank to collect the argon that had formed. A small (few cubic cm) gas counter was filled by the collected few tens of atoms of 37Ar (together with the stable argon) to detect its decays. In such a way, Davis was able to determine how many neutrinos had been captured.


== Conclusions ==
Davis' figures were consistently very close to one-third of Bahcall's calculations. The first response from the scientific community was that either Bahcall or Davis had made a mistake. Bahcall's calculations were checked repeatedly, with no errors found. Davis scrutinized his own experiment and insisted there was nothing wrong with it. The Homestake experiment was followed by other experiments with the same purpose, such as Kamiokande in Japan, SAGE in the former Soviet Union, GALLEX in Italy, Super Kamiokande, also in Japan, and SNO (Sudbury Neutrino Observatory) in Ontario, Canada. SNO was the first detector able to detect neutrino oscillation, solving the solar neutrino problem. The results of the experiment, published in 2001, revealed that of the three ""flavours"" between which neutrinos are able to oscillate, Davis's detector was sensitive to only one. After it had been proven that his experiment was sound, Davis shared the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physics for contributions to neutrino physics with Masatoshi Koshiba of Japan, who worked on the Kamiokande and the Super Kamiokande (the prize was also shared with Riccardo Giacconi for his contributions to x-ray astronomy).

Rachel Wong,"Rachel Wong is an American neuroscientist who is a professor of Biological Structure at the University of Washington. She studies the developmental mechanisms that determine synaptic connectivity in the central nervous system. She was elected to the National Vision Research Institute of Australia in 2018 and the National Academy of Sciences in 2021.


== Early life and education ==
Wong attended high school in Malaysia where she first became interested in physics. She would spend her lunch breaks examining living things, collected from a creek near her home, under the school microscope. Growing up, she learned to play musical instruments, much encouraged by her father. She moved to Monash University in Australia for her undergraduate degree, where she majored in physics and completed a research project in collaboration with the Biochemistry department. Specifically, her research used x-ray and neutron scattering to better understand muscular dystrophy. Wong earned her doctorate in vision science at the Australian National University. Her doctoral research, under the supervision of Professor Abbie Hughes, investigated the cellular organization and ontogeny of the cat retinal ganglion cell layer. She moved to the National Research Institute of Australia as a research associate, where she worked under Professor Abbie Hughes and Dr. David I. Vaney before moving to the United States. Wong was a C.J. Martin Fellow at Stanford University, mentored by Professor Carla J. Shatz. After a few years in the States, Wong returned to the University of Queensland as an R.D. Wright Fellow in Dr. Vaney's laboratory at the Vision, Touch and Hearing Research Center led by Professor Jack Pettigrew.

Herbert Kilpin,"Herbert Kilpin (24 January 1870 – 22 October 1916) was an English football player and manager, best known as the main founding father of AC Milan. After playing as an amateur in his native city of Nottingham, in the early 1890s he moved to Italy to work in the textile industry and he became one of the pioneers of football in the country, first as a player for Internazionale Torino and then as player, manager, and charter member of Milan.


== Early years ==
Kilpin was born in Nottingham on 24 January 1870. The son of a butcher, he grew up with nine older siblings at 129 Mansfield Road — though the place has been renumbered to 191 Mansfield Road since 1895. After leaving school, he worked as a lace warehouse assistant in the city. He was a keen footballer and, aged only 13, he had taken part at the foundation of a small amateur club named after Italian national hero Giuseppe Garibaldi, whose players wore the typical red shirts.


== Club career ==


=== From England to Italy ===
Kilpin's footballing career went on with the recently re-established Notts Olympic and then for St. Andrews, a church team based near the Forest Recreation Ground on Gregory Boulevard, where he played as a defender and midfielder.In 1891, Kilpin moved to Turin, in Italy, in order to work for Edoardo Bosio, an Italian-Swiss textile merchant with links to a Nottingham lace manufacturer. In the same year Bosio founded Internazionale Torino, believed to be the first full fledged Italian football club. Kilpin played for the team, becoming the first-ever Englishman to play football abroad. During this time, he also took part in the first two editions of the Italian Football Championship, losing both times in the final against Genoa.


=== Founding of AC Milan ===
By 1898, Kilpin had already left Turin and settled in Milan with fellow Englishman Samuel Richard Davies. The following year, the duo were among the charter members of AC Milan, under the original name of Milan Foot-Ball and Cricket Club. The first elected president was Alfred Edwards; while Kilpin, who was arguably their most experienced man, would serve as player-manager. However, he decided to let his oldest teammate David Allison be the captain for the first season.The newly founded club proved immediately successful, as they won the national title in 1901, only the second season of their history. Kilpin spent nine seasons at the club, making a total of 23 appearances and scoring 7 goals, and led the Rossoneri to two more titles in 1906 and 1907.


== Retirement and death ==
Kilpin married Maria Capua, a woman from Lodi, in 1905. Little is known about his life after he retired from football. He died in Milan on 22 October 1916, aged 46, probably due to his drinking and smoking habits. During the 1990s, an amateur historian named Luigi La Rocca tracked down Kilpin's grave, which was long believed to have been lost, in the Municipal Cemetery in Milan. It had no reference to his name and was located in a part of the cemetery reserved for Protestants. Therefore, in 1999, the club's centenary year, AC Milan paid for a new tombstone in the Monumental Graveyard. Following a petition, on 2 November 2010, Kilpin was inducted into the Famedio, the main building of the graveyard, where the tombs of the city's most illustrious personalities are located. Herberts great grandson Archie is now into a profession environment playing elite level football, he is currently rated by many and considered one of the most technical players throughout the English football league.


== The Lord of Milan book and film ==
Kilpin's story was forgotten after his death, but in 2016, author Robert Nieri released a book about his life called The Lord of Milan. It was part biography and part fiction. The author has admitted that details about Kilpin’s life were so scarce that he could not complete a full biography. The same year, a team from LeftLion began filming a documentary about Herbert Kilpin's life in both the UK and Italy. The film features commentary from Robert Nieri, Luigi La Rocca, Mark Hateley, Luther Blissett, Daniele Massaro, Giovanni Lodetti, John Foot and many others. The film was shown at cinemas and film festivals across Europe in 2017 and 2018 and eventually released online and on DVD in January 2019. It won two awards at the Olympic-accredited FICTS Film Festival in Milan in October 2017 and has since toured China.

Ruth C. Sullivan,"Ruth Christ Sullivan (April 20, 1924 – September 16, 2021) was an American organizer and advocate for education for people with autism.


== Activism ==
In 1965 Sullivan was one of the founders of the Autism Society of America (formerly called the National Society for Autistic Children), and was its first elected president; she is also on the permanent honorary board of the society. Ruth Sullivan was the founder and former executive director of the Autism Services Center, a nonprofit, licensed behavioral health care agency that she founded in Huntington, West Virginia in 1979. It now provides services in four counties to families who have a family member with developmental disabilities.  She retired from the Autism Services Center on November 1, 2007, at the age of 83.
Ruth Sullivan was one of the lobbyists for Public Law 94-142 (the Education of All Handicapped Children Act, now known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA), which guaranteed a public education to all children in the United States. Before the passage of the law, individual school districts in most states were allowed to choose whether they were willing to educate a child with disabilities.
She also helped found the West Virginia Autism Training Center at Marshall University, in Huntington, West Virginia, where her husband was a university professor.She has given presentations in countries including Australia, South Africa, Kuwait, Argentina, the Netherlands and France. She has written articles on autism from the point of view of parents and care providers, most recently in the Handbook of Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders (Wiley, 2005), edited by Fred Volkmar; she wrote the foreword to The Way I See It: A Personal Look at Autism and Asperger's (2008) by Temple Grandin, an adult with autism; she was the person who first asked Temple Grandin to speak in public about her autism. She is one of the founders of NARPAA, the National Association of Residential Providers for Adults with Autism.


== Film ==
Sullivan assisted in the production of the 1988 movie Rain Man by serving as a consultant on autistic behavior, and Dustin Hoffman worked with Sullivan and her son Joseph, who has autism, when practicing for his role. Hoffman thanked her and Joseph in his Oscar speech. Sullivan has the last credit in the movie, and the extended DVD version features an interview with Joe. Joe Sullivan was not the only inspiration for Hoffman's role; the role was originally written after writer Barry Morrow met savant Kim Peek. Other sources for the character of Raymond include Bill Sackter and Mark Rimland, son of Bernard Rimland.


== Personal life ==
Sullivan was trained as a Registered nurse at Charity Hospital (New Orleans). She served in the   United States Army Nurse Corps during World War II and afterwards became a public health nurse. She later earned a B.S. in Public Health Nursing and in 1952 an M.A. in Public Health Administration, from Teachers College, Columbia University.
She had seven children, and was a Kentucky Colonel. She received a PhD from Ohio University in 1984.
She died in Huntington, West Virginia, on September 16, 2021, at the age of 97.

Clark Global City,"Clark Global City (formerly the Global Gateway Logistics City) is a planned mixed-use central business district development at the Clark Freeport Zone in Mabalacat and Angeles City, Philippines.
Udenna Corporation is responsible for the development of Clark Global City since 2017. The development was initially meant as a product of Kuwaiti investment and was known as the Global Gateway Logistics City. The groundbreaking of the development took place in 2008.


== History ==


=== As Global Gateway Logistics City ===
Clark Global City was initially known as the Global Gateway Logistics City (GGLC). It was conceptualized by American firm Peregrine Development International Inc. (PDII) to the Kuwaiti investment firm KGL Investment Co. (KGLI Co.) in 2006. KGLI accepted PDII's proposal and signed a memorandum of agreement with the Clark International Airport Corporation regarding the project in April 2008. The groundbreaking ceremony was attended by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo in August of the same year. KGLI was owner and developer of the GGLC through Global Gateway Development Corp (GGDC).The GGLC was later renamed as the Sabah Al-Ahmad Global Gateway Logistics City in March 2012 honor of Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, the Emir of Kuwait who had a state visit to the Philippines within that same month.GGDC assumed operational control over the project's development in 2014 following a legal dispute with PDII over alleged breaches by the latter over the engineering, procurement and management (EPCM) agreement the two companies entered.


=== As Clark Global City ===
The land to be occupied by the Clark Global City was acquired from the Global Gateway Development Corporation, the former developer of the area by the Udenna Corporation in 2017. The transaction was made through loans from the Bank of China, BDO Unibank and the Philippine National Bank. Udenna effectively acquired the project by through buying out the stakes of GGDC Holdings, the majority shareholder of GGDC, by its subsidiary Clark City Global Corporation. The move was approved by the Philippine Competition Commission on October 18, 2017 and the acquisition was completed by November 14 of the same year. Udenna's property arm, Udenna Development Corporation has been tasked to oversee the development of the project.Clark Global City was officially launched the following year on May 29 by the Udenna Corporation. By this time 47 hectares (120 acres) of the 177 hectares (440 acres) of the Clark Global City has been developed. It is planned that the whole business development to be completed in ten years.

Fuller Houses,"The Fuller Houses are two historic homes at 339-341 and 343-345 Broadway in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Constructed in 1896–1897, the two Queen Anne-styled homes were constructed as rental properties for the Fuller family and are believed to have originally been identical in construction. The 2+1⁄2-story houses are marked by an octagonal bay which contains the front staircase and a large two-story porch projecting almost completely from the house itself. For the National Register of Historic Places nomination only a single unit was examined, but the identical unit below is believed to have undergone minimal alterations. The other house, 343-345 Broadway, was not surveyed, but has been more seriously modified to allow for four apartment units. The Fuller Houses are architecturally significant as well-preserved and well-detailed Queen Anne-styled apartment flats. The Fuller Houses were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.


== History ==
The Fuller Houses were constructed in 1896-1897 for Susan E. Fuller. Fuller's husband, Charles H. Fuller, operated a successful jewelry findings firm. The Fullers owned the houses until 1915, and intended to use them as rental properties. The only member of the Fuller family to reside in one of the houses, specifically 341 Broadway, was Alice G. Fuller beginning in either 1911 or 1912. The houses are positioned to be prominently viewed from their location on the east side of U.S Route 1 and from northbound traffic on Interstate 95. Though not originally placed in a location of such prominence, the construction through the heart of Pawtucket greatly increased the visibility of these ""I-95 landmarks"".


== Design ==
The Fuller Houses are originally believed to have been constructed as identical 2+1⁄2-story Queen Anne-styled homes with both having their gable-ends facing the street. The southern flank of the building is visually broken up by a two-story bay window with a gabled peak. A semi-octagonal bay on the northern corner of the houses indicates the position of the front staircase. A single-story porch with a shed-roof overhangs the front doorways. A striking feature of the Fuller Houses is the two-story circular porch on the southwest side. The porches are almost removed from the building and topped with a conical roof and ornamented with Queen Anne-style spindle. The exterior walls of the houses are clapboarded and the tops of the gables have simple metal finials.For the National Register of Historic Places nomination, only the interior of one of the four units was surveyed, the second floor interior of 341 Broadway. This unit is accessed from a spiral staircase leading from the first floor to the attic. The second floor landing has a short foyer before opening to two parlors. The front parlor is said to have had a water fountain which was removed, but the plumbing is said to exist within the floor. The back parlor has a Queen Anne mantel and leads to the dining room with large floor-to-ceiling china closets. Located on the east side of the apartment is the kitchen, pantry and rear staircase. The north part of the apartment contains two bedrooms and a bath. The NRHP nomination states that the alterations to the unit were minimal and it is likely that the same would have been done for the first floor unit. The northern Fuller House, containing 343-345 Broadway, has been more seriously modified because it has been split into four units. In 2013, real estate information for 343 Broadway suggests the expanse of the modifications to the house by listing the property as having 20 rooms, with 8 bedrooms and 5 baths. According to Trulia the house was sold in 2010 for $140,000 and still in the four unit configuration. A three-bay stuccoed garage dating from the 1920s or 1930 is used by 339-341 Broadway.


== Significance ==
The Fuller Houses are architecturally significant as a pair of two well-preserved and well-detailed two-family Queen Anne-style apartment ""flat"" houses. The Queen Anne-style spindle-work porches are descriptive in the NRHP nomination as the most impressive examples remaining in Pawtucket. The two houses represent an important step in the development of Pawtucket's architectural development and contribute to the city's visual character. The Fuller Houses were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

Arkanoid: Revenge of Doh,"Arkanoid: Revenge of Doh (a.k.a. Arkanoid 2) is an arcade game released by Taito in 1987 as a sequel to Arkanoid.


== Plot ==
The mysterious enemy known as DOH has returned to seek vengeance on the Vaus space vessel. The player must once again take control of the Vaus (paddle) and overcome many challenges in order to destroy DOH once and for all. Revenge of Doh sees the player battle through 34 rounds, taken from a grand total of 64.


== Gameplay ==
Revenge of Doh differs from its predecessor with the introduction of ""Warp Gates"". Upon completion of a level or when the Break (""B"") pill is caught, two gates appear at the bottom of the play area, on either side. The player can choose to go through either one of the gates - the choice will affect which version of the next level is provided. The fire-button is only used when the Laser Cannons (""L"") or Catch (""C"") pill is caught.
The game has new power-ups and enemy types, and two new types of bricks. Notched silver bricks, like normal silver bricks, take several hits to destroy. However, after a short period of time after destruction, they regenerate at full strength. These bricks do not need to be destroyed in order to complete a level. In addition, some bricks move left to right as long as their sides are not obstructed by other bricks.
The US version has an entirely different layout for Level 1 that feature an entire line of notched bricks, with all colored bricks above it moving from side to side.
On round 17, the player must defeat a giant brain as a mini-boss. After completing all 33 rounds, the player faces DOH in two forms as a final confrontation: its original, statue-like incarnation, then a creature with waving tentacles that break off and regenerate when struck.
Home versions include level editor, which players can use to create their own levels or edit and replace existing levels.


== Release ==
Revenge of Doh initially released in arcades in June 1987. In June 1989, versions for the Tandy, Atari ST, Apple IIGS, and Commodore 64 were released.


== Reception ==
In Japan, Game Machine listed Arkanoid: Revenge of Doh on their July 1, 1987 issue as being the third most-successful table arcade unit of the month. It went on to become Japan's eighth highest-grossing arcade conversion kit of 1988.

Hickory was the nut of choice (probably the species Carya ovata, known for its natural sweetness), since it is a nut tree endemic to North America, and is known to grow plentifully in those forested areas settled by the Cherokee.


== Nutritional value and historical use ==
Dried hickory nutmeat is high in both fat and protein, containing 3% water, 18% carbohydrates, 13% protein, and 64% fats. The nut was generally rendered into oil or made into a kind of nutmeal ball that could be used to make stock for stews and soups. Traditionally, kanuchi was eaten by adding the soup broth to hominy (Cherokee: A-ma-ge-i (ᎠᎹᎨᎢ)) that had been prepared from the flint corn (Cherokee: Se-lu(ᏎᎷ)). Hickory King corn is now principally used for making hominy.


== Traditional manner of preparation ==
Kanuchi is made by gathering hickory nuts (Cherokee: So-hi (ᏐᎯ)) in the wild, usually in October. The outer hulls are removed, while the nuts, complete with their inner-shells, are then dried on a rack in front of a fire. Since hickory nuts are rarely commercially exported, the hickory nut can be substituted by making use of pecans or walnuts, or by using an equal mixture of both walnuts and pecans. 
The dried hickory nuts with their shells are placed over a large flat rock that has been inserted within a flat basket lined temporarily with a cloth, and are then cracked open by pounding with a smaller rock. After breaking the outer shells and crushing the nut meat, the resulting nutmeat is sifted through a sieve basket (Today, modern sieves and strainers are used). The kernels and small hulls that passed through the sieve are taken up and put into a large wooden corn mortar and there pounded with a large wooden pestle (Cherokee: Ka-no-na (ᎧᏃᎾ)) until the substance can be made into balls. The crushed nuts were formed by hand into balls, to be stored in this way for several days until ready for use.
When soup was desired, an earthenware pot partly filled with water was traditionally used. The water was brought to a boil and the balls inserted into the pot of boiling water. Boiling water can also be poured over the balls while they are laid up in the pot, while stirring constantly. Once the soup reaches the right consistency, usually after cooking for 10 minutes, the soup can be ladled out and served. A thick soup is typically served with any type of bread or dumpling, whereas a thin soup may be used as a drink. Today, most food connoisseurs prefer eating kanuchi soup with rice, as its main viand, or else with sweet potatoes. Some recipes call for a dash of maple syrup to sweeten the soup.

Lake Elsinore Advanced Pumped Storage,"The Lake Elsinore Advanced Pumped Storage (LEAPS) project is a proposed 500 megawatt pumped-storage hydroelectricity power project located in Lake Elsinore, California. LEAPS is proposed to provide load balancing and power on-demand to the Southern California grid. LEAPS has been attempting to receive approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) since 2008. It has been rejected twice and is working on its third attempt to be approved.


== LEAPS ==
The Lake Elsinore Advanced Pumped Storage (“LEAPS”) project is an energy storage project with generating capacity up to 500MW designed to help stabilize electricity infrastructure and maximize the use of all forms of renewable energy.LEAPS leverages the unique combination of an existing water body, sufficient topographic variation, and proximity to southern California energy markets to construct and operate the most advanced, large-scale pumped hydro storage project in the US to meet California’s growing need for renewable electricity sources. The pumped storage facility serves the power needs of both the San Diego and Los Angeles metropolitan areas; and augments the local economy in the Temescal Valley through: i) significant temporary construction and operations jobs; ii) indirect employment in the hospitality and service sector; iii) payment of municipal and state taxes and fees; iv) contributions through partnerships with community organizations.
California has set renewable energy targets of 50% of total generation capacity by 2030. As a result, renewable, greenhouse gas emissions-free generation and storage capacity is needed more than ever to optimize the contribution of renewable sources such as solar and wind energy. LEAPS is designed to help answer this challenge. California also has a goal of 100% fossil-fuel free electricity by the year 2045. This project will still rely on fossil fuel and will not meet the 2045 standard.
Nevada Hydro filed its Final License Application (“FLA”) with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) on October 2, 2017 and is executing a rigorous meeting and review schedule with all relevant agencies in accordance with the terms of the FERC hydro licensing process. In addition, Nevada Hydro is undertaking additional stakeholder communications via its website, project materials, meetings, email bulletins and will be scheduling an open house for residents in the Temescal Valley.

Morris & Co.,"Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. (1861–1875) was a furnishings and decorative arts manufacturer and retailer founded by the artist and designer William Morris with friends from the Pre-Raphaelites. With its successor Morris & Co. (1875–1940) the firm's medieval-inspired aesthetic and respect for hand-craftsmanship and traditional textile arts had a profound influence on the decoration of churches and houses into the early 20th century.
Although its most influential period was during the flourishing of the Arts and Crafts Movement in the 1880s and 1890s, Morris & Co. remained in operation in a limited fashion from World War I until its closure in 1940.  The firm's designs are still sold today under licences given to Sanderson & Sons, part of the Walker Greenbank wallpaper and fabrics business (which owns the ""Morris & Co."" brand,) and to Liberty of London.


== Early years ==
Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co., ""Fine Art Workmen in Painting, Carving, Furniture and the Metals"", was jointly created by Morris, Ford Madox Brown, Edward Burne-Jones, Charles Faulkner, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, P. P. Marshall, and Philip Webb in 1861 to create and sell medieval-inspired, handcrafted items for the home. The prospectus set forth that the firm would undertake carving, stained glass, metal-work, paper-hangings, chintzes (printed fabrics), and carpets. The first headquarters of the firm were at 8 Red Lion Square in London.The work shown by the firm at the 1862 International Exhibition attracted much notice, and within a few years it was flourishing. In the autumn of 1864, a severe illness obliged Morris to choose between giving up his home at Red House in Kent and giving up his work in London. With great reluctance he gave up Red House, and in 1865 established himself under the same roof with his workshops, which by then had relocated to larger premises in Queen Square, Bloomsbury.The decoration of churches was from the first an important part of the business. A great wave of church-building and remodelling by the Church of England in the 1840s and 1850s increased the demand for ecclesiastical decoration of all kinds, especially stained glass.  But this market shrank in the general depression of the later 1860s, and the firm increasingly turned to secular commissions. On its non-ecclesiastical side, the product line was extended to include, besides painted windows and mural decoration, furniture, metal and glass wares, cloth and paper wall-hangings, embroideries, jewellery, woven and knotted carpets, silk damasks, and tapestries.
Morris was producing repeating patterns for wallpaper as early as 1862, and some six years later he designed his first pattern specifically for fabric printing. As in so many other areas that interested him, Morris chose to work with the ancient technique of hand woodblock printing in preference to the roller printing which had almost completely replaced it for commercial uses.


== Reorganization and expansion ==
In August 1874, Morris determined to restructure the partnership, generating a dispute with Marshall, Rossetti, and Madox Brown over the return on their shares. The company was dissolved and reorganized under Morris's sole ownership as Morris & Co. on 31 March 1875.During these years, Morris took up the practical art of dyeing as a necessary adjunct of his manufacturing business. He spent much of his time at the Staffordshire dye works of Thomas Wardle, mastering the processes of that art and making experiments in the revival of old or discovery of new methods. One result of these experiments was to reinstate indigo dyeing as a practical industry, and generally to renew the use of those vegetable dyes, like madder, which had been driven almost out of use by the anilines.
Dyeing of wools, silks, and cottons was the necessary preliminary to what he had much at heart, the production of woven and printed fabrics of the highest excellence; and the period of incessant work at the dye-vat (1875–76) was followed by a period during which he was absorbed in the production of textiles (1877–78), and more especially in the revival of carpet-weaving as a fine art.
In June 1881, Morris relocated his dyeworks from Queen Square to an early eighteenth-century silk-throwing works at Merton Abbey Mills, after determining that the water of the River Wandle was suitable for dyeing.  The complex, on 7 acres (28,000 m2), included several buildings and a dyeworks, and the various buildings were soon adapted for stained-glass, textile printing, and fabric- and carpet-weaving.In 1879, Morris had taught himself tapestry weaving in the medieval style and set up a tapestry workshop with his apprentice John Henry Dearle at Queen Square. Dearle executed Morris and Co.'s first figural tapestry from a design by Walter Crane in 1883. Dearle was soon responsible for the training of all tapestry apprentices in the expanded workshop at Merton Abbey, and partnered with Morris on designing details such as fabric patterns and floral backgrounds for tapestries based on figure drawings or cartoons by Burne-Jones (some of them repurposed from stained glass cartoons). and animal figures by Philip Webb. Suites of tapestries were made as part of whole-house decorating schemes, and tapestries of Burne-Jones angels and scenes from the Arthurian legends were a staple of Morris & Co. into the twentieth century.


== Important commissions ==
The firm's first commissions—stained glass and decorative schemes for St Michael's Church, Brighton, All Saints Church, Selsley, and Jesus Chapel, Cambridge—came from the architect G F Bodley in the early 1860s. Following this, two significant secular commissions helped to establish the firm's reputation in the late 1860s: a royal project at St. James's Palace and the ""green dining room"" at the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert) of 1867. The green dining room (preserved as the Morris Room at the V&A) featured stained glass windows and panel figures by Burne-Jones, panels with branches of fruit and flowers by Morris, and olive branches and a frieze by Philip Webb. The St. James's commission comprised decorative schemes for the Armoury and the Tapestry Room, and included panels of stylized floral patterns painted on ceilings, cornices, dadoes, windows, and doors.In 1871, Morris & Co. were responsible for the windows at All Saints church in the village of Wilden near to Stourport-on-Severn. They were designed by Burne-Jones for Alfred Baldwin, his wife's brother-in-law.
Standen near East Grinstead, West Sussex, was designed between 1892 and 1894 by Philip Webb for a prosperous London solicitor, James Beale, his wife Margaret, and their family. It is decorated with Morris carpets, fabrics and wallpapers.
In 1895, Morris & Co made the Garden Tulip wallpapers for the private apartments of Nicholas II in the Imperial Winter Palace in Saint-Petersburg, Russia. This fact was discovered by the curators in the State Hermitage museum some years ago.  Stanmore Hall was the last major decorating commission executed by Morris & Co. before Morris's death in 1896. It was also the most extensive commission undertaken by the firm, and included a series of tapestries based on the story of the Holy Grail for the dining room, to which Morris devoted his energies, the rest of the work being executed under the direction of Dearle.Other Morris & Co. commissions include the ceiling within the dining room of Charleville Forest Castle, Ireland; interiors of Bullers Wood House, now Bullers Wood School in Chislehurst, Kent; and stained glass windows at Adcote.


== Last stages ==
As Morris pursued other interests, notably socialism and the Kelmscott Press, day-to-day work at the firm was delegated. Morris's daughter May became the director of the embroidery department in 1885, when she was in her early twenties.  Dearle, who had begun designing repeating patterns for wallpapers and textiles in the late 1880s, was head designer for the firm by 1890, handling interior design commissions and supervising the tapestry, weaving, and fabric-printing departments at Merton Abbey.Dearle's contributions to textile design were long overshadowed by Morris. Dearle exhibited his designs under the Morris name rather than his own in the Arts and Crafts Exhibitions and the major Morris retrospective of 1899, and even today many Dearle designs are popularly offered as ""William Morris"" patterns.
On Morris's death in 1896, Dearle became the art director of the firm, which changed its name again, to Morris & Co. Decorators Ltd., in 1905. The company was still making good-quality stained glass into the 1920s: Holy Trinity Church, Elsecar, has several Morris & Co. windows dated 1922. Dearle managed the company's textile works at Merton Abbey until his own death in 1932. The firm was finally dissolved in the early months of World War II.

"Tom Taylor, Baron Taylor of Blackburn","Thomas Taylor, Baron Taylor of Blackburn,  (10 June 1929 – 25 November 2016) was a businessman and Labour politician. He was a member of Blackburn Council for 22 years, serving as its leader from 1972 to 1976. In 1978, he became a member of the House of Lords. In 2009, he was suspended from the House, along with Baron Truscott, as a result of the cash for influence scandal, the first peers to be suspended since the 17th century.


== Early life and family ==
Thomas Taylor was born in Blackburn, the son of James and Edith Taylor. He attended Blakey Moor elementary school, but left at the age of fourteen to work as a shop assistant in the local co-op. He later became a branch representative of the USDAW union.
In 1950, at the age of 21, Taylor married Kathleen Nurton. They had one son, Paul Taylor.


== Career ==
Taylor was elected to Blackburn Town Council in 1954, later becoming chairman of the education committee. In 1960, he was appointed a JP on the Blackburn bench. A Congregationalist and committed Christian, he was named president of the Free Church Council in 1963. He was awarded the Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1969 Queen's Birthday Honours list. He served as leader of Blackburn Council from 1972 to 1976, on the recommendation of fellow church-goer and former leader Sir George Eddie. For his services to local government, he was awarded the Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1974 Queen's Birthday Honours.One of Taylor's successes as a councillor was the setting up of special centers to help recent immigrants who had arrived in the town to work in the textile industry. As chairman of the education committee, he imposed a ceiling of 7% on the number of immigrant children in any one school, bussing additional children to other schools. The aim was to ensure an ethnic mix in local schools to promote social integration and help the children learn English.He became leader of education services on Lancashire County Council, as well as being Chairman of the juvenile bench. A consensual politician in the tradition of Hugh Gaitskell, he steered comprehensive education through despite some concerns in the town. There he developed the Rochdale tradition of co-operative societies on the council bringing together teachers and parents on a corporatist model. He utilized the leverage of businesses to help finance educational needs by brokerage of a third way for community uses of premises out of school hours and during holidays. He was not a particular friend of Barbara Castle, the local MP who was so close to Prime Minister Harold Wilson, and was delighted to influence the succession of Jack Straw to the seat on her retirement. Taylor's socialist circle included James Callaghan; when Taylor lost his seat on the Blackburn Council in 1976 he was a natural recruit for the labour peerage. His froideur toward Castle was not helped when he was asked to share an office at the House of Lords.


== National education and Labour governments ==
Taylor was an acolyte of Harold Wilson. Sitting on the Public School Commission in 1958, he attacked Public Schools Headmasters Conference reluctance to relinquish their independent status. Their refusal to integrate in the comprehensive system caused Labour and Taylor to threaten class warfare for failing to modernize. In 1972, Taylor was embroiled in a row to dismiss a communist English lecturer, Dr. David Craig, at the new Lancaster University of which he was a co-founder and deputy Pro-Chancellor.  Students staged a sit-in when the Vice-Chancellor refused to lift a threat of disciplinary action against the political agitation. Taylor was remitted to act independently but investigate the causes. Taylor's Report of July 1972 exonerated the local authority of any blame, but thought the whole case had poisoned the atmosphere and culture of the university. Craig was reinstated, though outside the faculty, while the Vice-Chancellor archly refused any assistance for delegations. The following year he accused the Conservative government of a failure to invest: a creaking management had invested the system with paralysis by analysis.
In his role as president of the Association of Education Committees, Taylor continued to press for more investment in schools and universities. A somewhat cynical approach was dictated by his disdain for the peerage, ""or as third best chose a mother who has a degree."" He carried forward the tripartite industrial strategies of Labour's super-ministries into the new Wilsonian era, when the Education Secretary Reg Prentice asked him to report on school management. The report New Partnership for Our Schools was the first attempt to put schools on the same footing as independents by giving overall management control to a board of Governors, in co-operation with the teachers and parents.Taylor was Chairman of the Electricity Consultative Council for the Northwest and a member of the Board of Norweb from 1977 to 1980. He served on various governmental bodies connected with education in the region, including the North West Economic Planning Council and the North West Area Health Authority. He was created a Life Peer on 4 May 1978 taking the title Baron Taylor of Blackburn, of Blackburn in the County of Lancashire.He was listed in Who's Who 2009 as a non-executive director of Drax Power Ltd and A Division Holdings, a Consultant to BAE Systems plc; Initial Electronic Security Systems Ltd; and an adviser to Electronic Data Systems Ltd, AES Electric Ltd, United Utilities plc, Experian, and Capgemini UK plc.  On 29 January 2009, Experian agreed with Taylor that he would retire as an adviser.  By 30 January 2009, he was an adviser to NPL Estates, Alcatel-Lucent, Canatxx Energy Ventures Ltd, BT plc, Gersphere UK and T-Systems; and a non-executive director only of A Division Holdings He was president or patron of various organizations and held an Hon. LLD from the University of Lancaster from 1996. He was a Freeman of Blackburn and the City of London.  At various times in his career, he was also chairman of the National Foundation for Visual Aids.


== Health ==
Labour was in opposition in 1983, and Taylor was alleged to have been a likely appointment to the front bench, but his wife committed him to hospital under the Mental Health Act 1983, due to a problem with alcohol. Taylor applied for a writ of habeas corpus arguing that the Mental Health Act could not apply to peers when the House was sitting. After 19 days in hospital, his barrister secured his release, and the case never came to court.


== 2009 cash for influence scandal ==

In late-January 2009, Taylor was one of four Labour peers accused of 'sleaze' by The Sunday Times — it was alleged that Taylor proclaimed to two journalists posing as lobbyists that he was ready, willing, and able to help a business secure favorable legislation in their sphere of interest in return for a fee reported to be in excess of £100,000. Taylor was duped, and his behavior exposed by the reporter's 'sting' operation. The Conservative leader in Blackburn with Darwen demanded that the Freedom of the City Award be stripped from the former councillor.  A few days later on 20 May 2009, the House of Lords considered the report of its Privileges Committee and voted to suspend Taylor and Peter Truscott for six months, the first such action since the 17th century.


== Expenses ==
In 2005, Taylor claimed £57,000, the second-highest level of expenses claimed in the House of Lords. He spoke 15 times in the chamber that year.Over the 2014-15 parliamentary session, Taylor claimed £43,110 in expenses, including £29,100 in tax-free attendance allowances, during which he did not speak in the House of Lords. Taylor, then aged 86, defended his record by saying he votes regularly and only speaks on matters of which he has some knowledge or experience.


== Death ==
On 17 November 2016, Taylor was involved in an accident when his mobility scooter collided with a van on the corner of Millbank and Great College Street, near the House of Lords. He died on 25 November 2016 as a result of injuries sustained in the crash. Angela Smith, Shadow leader of the House of Lords, said he would be ""sadly missed"". She continued, ""Tom Taylor had a life-long commitment to the Labour Party, through both local government and Parliament, and was held in high regard and with great affection by his party colleagues."" The Metropolitan Police investigated the scene and detained a 55-year-old man but had not pressed charges at the time of the baron’s death in hospital. In March 2018, the driver admitted to causing the death by careless driving and was given a 24-week suspended sentence on 9 April 2018.

Banksia dentata,"Banksia dentata, commonly known as the tropical banksia, is a species of tree in the genus Banksia. It occurs across northern Australia, southern New Guinea and the Aru Islands. Growing as a gnarled tree to 7 m (23 ft) high, it has large green leaves up to 22 cm (8.7 in) long with dentate (toothed) margins. The cylindrical yellow inflorescences (flower spikes), up to 13 cm (5.1 in) high, appear between November and May, attracting various species of honeyeaters, sunbirds, the sugar glider and a variety of insects. Flowers fall off the ageing spikes, which swell and develop follicles containing up to two viable seeds each.
Banksia dentata is one of four Banksia species collected by Sir Joseph Banks in 1770, and one of the four species published in 1782 as part of Carolus Linnaeus the Younger's original description of Banksia. Within the genus, it is classified in the series Salicinae, a group of species from Australia's eastern states. Genetic studies show it is a basal member within the group. Banksia dentata is found in tropical grassland known as savanna, associated with Pandanus and Melaleuca. It regenerates from bushfire by regrowing from its woody base, known as a lignotuber.


== Description ==
The tropical banksia is generally a small tree which grows to around 4 m (13 ft) or sometimes up to 7 m (23 ft) tall, with a rough stocky trunk, spreading crown, and crooked branches. The dark grey bark is not flaky but tesselated in texture and appearance. Initially covered in reddish hair that wears away, branchlets become smooth and grey with age. The large green leaves are scattered along the stems, and more crowded at the branchlet tips. They are 9–22 cm (3.5–8.7 in) long and 2–9 cm (0.79–3.54 in) wide, obovate in shape with mucronate tips. The dentate (toothed) margins are lined irregularly with 0.1–1.3 cm (0.039–0.512 in) long teeth, separated by u-shaped sinuses. The leaves are undulate (wavy) with white undersurfaces, the midrib raised underneath and depressed above. The cylindrical yellow inflorescences (flower spikes), arise from one- to three-year-old branches. Appearing between November and May, they are 10 to 13 cm (3.9 to 5.1 in) high and 5 to 10 cm (2.0 to 3.9 in) wide. Newly opened flower spikes smell like corn. All flower parts are pale yellow; the perianth is 2.5–3.2 cm (0.98–1.26 in) long, including a 0.5 cm (0.20 in) long limb. After anthesis, the pistil is 3.1–4.6 cm (1.2–1.8 in) long. Flower parts soon fall off ageing spikes, which develop into irregular-cylindrical infructescences. The oval follicles are 1.5–2 cm (0.59–0.79 in) long, 0.4–0.8 cm (0.16–0.31 in) high and 0.5–0.8 cm (0.20–0.31 in) wide. Pale green and furry when young, they become smooth and pale brown with age. The follicles open spontaneously with maturity. They contain two seeds each, between which lies a woody dark brown separator of similar shape to the seeds. Measuring 1.8–2.1 cm (0.7–0.8 in) in length, the seed is obovate, and composed of a dark brown 1.1–1.4 cm (0.4–0.6 in) wide membranous 'wing' and obovate seed proper which measures 1.0–1.2 cm (0.4–0.5 in) long by 0.5–0.8 cm (0.2–0.3 in) wide. The seed surface can be smooth or covered in tiny ridges.The bright green cotyledons are obovate, measuring 1.6–1.9 cm (0.63–0.75 in) long by 0.8–1.1 cm (0.31–0.43 in) wide. At the base of each are two pointed auricles around 1.5 mm (0.059 in) long. The cotyledons arise from a 3–4 mm (0.12–0.16 in) high smooth hypocotyl that is 1–1.5 mm (0.039–0.059 in) in diameter. The subsequent seedling leaves are opposite initially, arising 3–4 mm above the cotyledons. Each is roughly linear in shape, measuring 2.5–2.7 cm (0.98–1.06 in) long and 0.4–0.5 cm (0.16–0.20 in) wide, with two to three serrations (""teeth"") on the upper quarter to third of the leaf margin's length. The leaf undersurface is covered with white hair. Successive leaves become more obovate and are 3–7 cm (1.2–2.8 in) long and 0.8–1.2 cm (0.31–0.47 in) wide, with dentate margins and mucronate tips. Seedling stems are hairy.


== Taxonomy ==
Specimens of Banksia dentata were collected from the vicinity of the Endeavour River somewhere between 17 June and 3 August 1770 by Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander, naturalists on the Endeavour during Lieutenant (later Captain) James Cook's first voyage to the Pacific Ocean. Solander coined the (unpublished) binomial name Leucadendrum (later Leucadendron) dentatum in Banks' Florilegium. However, the formal description of the species was not published until April 1782, when Carolus Linnaeus the Younger described the first four Banksia species in his Supplementum Plantarum. Linnaeus distinguished them by their leaf shapes, and named them accordingly. Thus this species' dentate (toothed) leaf margins saw it given the specific name dentata, the Latin adjective for ""toothed"". Banksia dentata is monotypic, and no subspecies are recognised. Though not closely studied, reports suggest it does not vary significantly over its range.Robert Brown recorded 31 species of Banksia in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen, and in his taxonomic arrangement, placed the taxon in the subgenus Banksia verae, the ""True Banksias"", because the inflorescence is a typical Banksia flower spike. By the time Carl Meissner published his 1856 arrangement of the genus, there were 58 described Banksia species. Meissner divided Brown's Banksia verae, which had been renamed Eubanksia by Stephan Endlicher in 1847, into four series based on leaf properties. He placed B. dentata in the series Quercinae (the oak-like banksias).In 1870, George Bentham published a thorough revision of Banksia in his Flora Australiensis. In Bentham's arrangement, the number of recognised Banksia species was reduced from 60 to 46. Bentham defined four sections based on leaf, style and pollen-presenter characters. Banksia dentata was placed in section Eubanksia alongside B. marginata and a broadly defined B. integrifolia.In 1891, Otto Kuntze, in his Revisio Generum Plantarum, rejected the generic name Banksia L.f., on the grounds that the name Banksia had previously been published in 1776 as Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst, referring to the genus now known as Pimelea. Kuntze proposed Sirmuellera as an alternative, referring to this species as Sirmuellera dentata. For the same reason, James Britten transferred the species to the genus Isostylis as Isostylis dentata in 1905. These applications of the principle of priority were largely ignored, and Banksia L.f. was formally conserved and Sirmuellera rejected in 1940.Commonly known as the tropical banksia, B. dentata is known locally as swamp banksia, and guibuk by the indigenous people in Kakadu National Park. Its local name in the Nunggubuyu language of eastern Arnhem Land is rilirdili. Other names from the same region include Enindurrkwa in the Enindhilyagwa language of Groote Eylandt, and gulpu in the Rirratjingu language of Yirrkala. Frederick Manson Bailey reported in 1913 that the indigenous people of Cape Bedford knew it as kabir.


=== Placement within Banksia ===
The current taxonomic arrangement of the genus Banksia is based on botanist Alex George's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series. In this arrangement, B. dentata is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, because its inflorescences take the form of Banksia's characteristic flower spikes, section Banksia because of its straight styles, and series Salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical. There has been debate on which species it is most closely related to. Alf Salkin had noted that B. dentata displays characteristics which are primitive within the genus. Unlike southern banksias, it has small juvenile leaves and broad dentate adult leaves. Alex George concluded initially that its affinities lay with Banksia integrifolia on account of their similar inflorescences. In a morphological cladistic analysis published in 1994, Kevin Thiele placed it in the newly described subseries Acclives along with B. plagiocarpa, B. robur and B. oblongifolia within the series Salicinae. These four species all have follicles which point slightly upwards towards the apex of the flower spike. It was held to be most closely related to B. robur on account of its large undulate leaves. Salkin had also noted that the seedling leaves of B. dentata, B. robur and B. oblongifolia were all similar and roughly linear, suggesting a close relationship. However, this subgrouping of the Salicinae was not supported by George; he discounted a close relationship with B. robur, which he felt was too distinctive.B. dentata's placement within Banksia according to Flora of Australia is as follows:

Genus Banksia

B. dentata – B. aquilonia – B. integrifolia – B. plagiocarpa – B. oblongifolia – B. robur – B. conferta –   B. paludosa –  B. marginata – B. canei – B. saxicolaSince 1998, American botanist Austin Mast and co-authors have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae, which then comprised genera Banksia and Dryandra. Their analyses suggest a phylogeny that differs greatly from George's taxonomic arrangement. Banksia dentata resolves as an early offshoot within the Salicinae. In 2007, Mast and Thiele rearranged the genus Banksia by merging Dryandra into it, and published B. subg. Spathulatae for the taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons; thus B. subg. Banksia was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, B. dentata is placed in B. subg. Spathulatae.


== Distribution and habitat ==
Across northern Australia, Banksia dentata has been recorded as far west as the Wunaamin Miliwundi Ranges in the western Kimberley through the Northern Territory and extending south to Nitmiluk Gorge and into Queensland, where it is found on the Cape York Peninsula to as far south as Cooktown. Off the coast, it has been recorded from Groote Eylandt and the Wessel Islands, as well as Melville and Bathurst Islands. It also extends onto the Aru Islands, where it is found around Trangan, and New Guinea, where it ranges in the south from Merauke east to Port Moresby, and around Bulolo and Mount Mau. It is the only Banksia species not endemic to Australia. As much of its range is in remote and poorly surveyed country, it is possible that it is found more widely than has been recorded. Pollen samples indicate it has been present on the Torres Strait Islands over the past 8000 years, though it has not been a prominent component of the island flora.Banksia dentata generally grows on sandy soils in savanna woodland or shrubland, along freshwater swamps, watercourses, floodplains or other seasonally wet areas. It has also been found on rocky outcrops, of quartzite or sandstone, to an elevation of around 500 m (1,600 ft) in Australia, and up to 1,200 m (3,900 ft) in New Guinea. In New Guinea it is restricted to areas which have a distinct dry season.Banksia dentata is often found with Melaleuca and Pandanus species. On Cape York, it is a dominant component in a low scrub known as ""wet desert"" due to its resemblance to arid scrub yet occurring in a monsoon climate. On phosphorus-poor soils, Banksia dentata is found with Melaleuca saligna and Thryptomene oligandra. On Melville Island it is a dominant component of Banksia low woodland, forming part of a 3–6 m (9.8–19.7 ft) high canopy with Melaleuca viridiflora; the understory is composed of sedges such as Fimbristylis, Sorghum intrans, Eriachne, Germainia grandiflora and the restiad Dapsilanthus spathaceus, as well as suckering shrubs Lophostemon lactifluus and Syzygium eucalyptoides. This community grows in wet areas, with a grey topsoil with high moisture and gravel content but low sand.


== Ecology ==
Banksia dentata responds to bushfire by resprouting from its woody lignotuber although, unlike other members of the Salicinae, it lacks dormant buds at its base. It was described by amateur botanist and banksia enthusiast Alf Salkin as resembling an ""upturned parsnip"". Plant communities where it is found are subject to periodic bushfires, and it can become more dominant if fires occur often.Salkin had noted that its tropical position might mean that B. dentata was a key species in the transition from rainforest to open habitat in the ancestry of the genus. One adaptation to a drier sunnier climate was a thick intermediate layer under the epidermis in the leaf architecture. This layer, the hypodermis, contains large vacuoles that are filled with a phenolic compound, and seems to serve to reduce the intensity of sunlight reaching the mesophyll.Numerous nectar-feeding insects are attracted to the flower spikes, which in turn attract honeyeaters, silvereyes and sunbirds, many of which consume both nectar and insects. The sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) forages among the flower spikes and is a probable pollinator. The common blossom bat (Syconycteris australis) feeds on nectar. B. dentata has been recorded as a host plant for the mistletoe species Amyema benthamii, Decaisnina angustata and D. signata.


== Cultivation ==
The tree's gnarled bark, large green leaves, and yellow flower spikes are attractive horticultural features. B. dentata is vulnerable to cold winters in cultivation in Melbourne and recovers over the hotter months of summer. It has not been able to be grown in colder climates, such as those of Canberra. Flowering occurs around 5 to 8 years from seed. Plants can be pruned hard, and do best on a sandy slightly acid soil of pH 5.5–6.5. They can be vulnerable to borers. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 32 to 40 days to germinate.  Banksia dentata was introduced into the United Kingdom in 1822.Banksia dentata is used as a nectar source in the honey bee industry. Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory would light old seed cones and use them as firebrands, these lasting for up to two hours. The nectar was consumed by indigenous people. A hot smoking flower spike was used to cauterise leprosy sores, and people suffering from diarrhea would squat over smoking cones in the hope this would relieve their symptoms.  The thin woody spikes that did not develop follicles were used as nasal ornaments by aboriginal women, and flower spikes were used as combs.

Fifth Avenue Line (Brooklyn elevated),"The Fifth Avenue Line, also called the Fifth Avenue Elevated or Fifth Avenue–Bay Ridge Line, was an elevated rail line in Brooklyn, New York City, United States. It ran above Hudson Avenue, Flatbush Avenue, Fifth Avenue, 38th Street, and Third Avenue from Downtown Brooklyn south to Bay Ridge. The portion on Third Avenue was called the Third Avenue Elevated to distinguish service from the elevated BMT West End Line; it was separate from the elevated IRT Third Avenue Line in Manhattan and the Bronx.


== History ==
The Union Elevated Railroad Company, leased by the Brooklyn Elevated Railroad, built the Hudson Avenue Elevated, a branch of the Brooklyn Elevated Railroad's Lexington Avenue Elevated. This line split from the Brooklyn elevated at a junction at Hudson and Park Avenues (where exit 29 of the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway is now located), and traveled south above Hudson Avenue to the Long Island Rail Road's Flatbush Avenue terminal. Trains began operating between Fulton Ferry (the terminal of the Brooklyn elevated) and Flatbush Avenue on November 5, 1888.The line crossed the BMT Myrtle Avenue Line at grade two blocks south of its merge with the Brooklyn elevated. On its second day of operation, November 6, a Hudson Avenue train crashed into a Myrtle Avenue train. Service was suspended immediately, and did not resume until June 22, 1889, when an extension south to Third Street was completed, and a new connection into Myrtle Avenue opened, taking trains between Third Street and Sands Street at the end of the Myrtle Avenue Line, and replacing the four track crossings with one. The unused two blocks north of Myrtle Avenue were placed back in service on December 9, 1889, when Myrtle Avenue trains began to use it to reach Fulton Ferry via the old Brooklyn elevated.An extension south to 25th Street at Greenwood Cemetery was opened at 4 p.m. on August 15, 1889. At this new terminal, elevated passengers could transfer to the north end of the Brooklyn, Bath and West End Railroad for Coney Island. A further extension to 36th Street, at a new Union Depot serving the West End Line and Prospect Park and Coney Island Railroad (Culver Line) to Coney Island, opened on May 29, 1890. The Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) had service on the elevated line from Brooklyn Bridge, through Atlantic and Flatbush Avenues to the 36th Street Union Depot, connecting with the Manhattan Beach Line starting in 1895.The Seaside and Brooklyn Bridge Elevated Railroad was organized on March 18, 1890 to extend the Fifth Avenue Elevated south to Fort Hamilton, to extend the Lexington Avenue Elevated from Van Siclen Avenue east to the city line, and to build in High Street at the Brooklyn Bridge (this became part of the Sands Street station loop). The extension of the Fifth Avenue Elevated, along Fifth Avenue, 38th Street, and Third Avenue, opened to 65th Street on October 1, 1893.On June 25, 1923, two cars of a northbound train derailed and fell towards Flatbush Avenue. Eight passengers died and many were injured. At midnight on June 1, 1940, service on the Fifth Avenue Elevated ended as required by the unification of the city's three subway companies.On September 15, 1941, the demolition of the Fifth Avenue Elevated started at 35th Street and Fifth Avenue, and it was completed by November of that year. The section of the elevated on Third Avenue from 38th Street to 65th Street was used as part of the elevated highway approach, the Gowanus Expressway, to the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel. In total, three miles of the elevated were scrapped, with the work being done by the Harris Structural Steel Company.

Martha Kane,"Martha Kane is a fictional character from the British Channel 4 soap opera Hollyoaks, played by Carli Norris. The character debuted on-screen during the episode broadcast on 18 January 2012. The character was introduced as the mother of Ash (Holly Weston), Callum (Laurie Duncan) and Lacey Kane (Georgia Bourke). Martha is portrayed as a feisty female and a liberal parent. Martha is an alcoholic and has been used to portray the effects the issue has on involved family members. Her addiction causes trouble and affects her youngest daughter, Lacey, following a violent altercation. Despite attempting to overcome her addiction, Martha failed to stop drinking.
The character has also featured in comedy scenes and struck up friendships with fellow older characters. She has also feuds with Ash's boyfriends. Martha dislikes Ally Gorman (Dan O'Connor) and eventually exposes him as a fraud. She later sets out to prove Will Savage (James Atherton) is a murderer and succeeds. After two years at Hollyoaks,  Norris filmed her final scenes, which aired on 8 November 2013. Laura Morgan from All About Soap branded Martha as soap opera's worst mother, while reporters from Digital Spy and What's on TV believed that the character left in ""high regard"".


== Character development ==


=== Introduction and characterisation ===
In January 2012, the serial's producer Emma Smithwick said that she wanted to explore Ash (Holly Weston) and Callum Kane's (Laurie Duncan) backstories. She revealed that she planned to introduce ""satellite"" family members in the process. Martha appeared on a semi-regular basis. On the serial's official website, Martha is described as being ""loveable but feisty, straight-talking and fun"". Martha is more of a ""liberal parent than a strict one"". Martha is a single mother, she dislikes the father of her children who wealthy and lives in Dubai.
Martha is the feisty mother of Callum, Ash and Lacey. Not the most conventional of mums, she can often be found accompanying (an unwilling) Ash on a night out... she even danced on the bar at the Spring Fling! There's a dark side to Martha's party animal ways though.
Martha is immature for her age but tries to do the right thing for her children. Norris believes that Martha is ""very immauture"" because she became pregnant with Ash at a young age, subsequently losing her own childhood. Martha's behavior can alienate people and Norris felt challenged with her scripts to make Martha more likeable. She did so by feeling sympathetic and attempting to understand Martha's behaviour. The character has also been used to portray comedic scenes which drew praise from viewers. Some were shared with Diane O'Connor (Alex Fletcher) and Myra McQueen (Nicole Barber-Lane) and Norris claimed that fans pestered her wanting more scenes featuring the trio.


=== Alcoholism ===
In one storyline, Ash is diagnosed with meningitis, which leaves Martha unable to cope and she turns to alcohol. Weston told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that the storyline shows that Martha is ""not quite the good mum that she pretends to be"". This was the first time that viewers were made aware of Martha's alcohol problem. Weston opined that viewers did not understand the reasons they complained about Martha. The scenes gave ""a good picture"" as to why Ash and Callum had made her out to be a ""nightmare mum"". Callum is left to deal with Martha's behaviour alone, which proves to be ""quite difficult for him"". Norris told Alison Slade from TVTimes that Martha ""would die for her children"" but she still behaves like a child herself. She cannot deal with ""anything that requires her to step up and be a mother"". Norris said that Martha keeps deserting her family and leaving them to cope with alone. Martha ""manipulates Callum and wraps him around her little finger, like she always does."" Martha cannot cope with the situation and even misses a meeting with a doctor. The actress added that she Martha would ""rather it was Callum sorting it out"".Martha later begins a relationship with her boss. When he cancels their date, Martha begins drinking. However, her daughter Lacey Kane (Georgia Bourke) intervenes by pouring her wine down the sink. Bourke told TVTimes' Slade that ""Martha's a bit drunk by that point and lashes out"". The following morning Martha is ""breezy"" and acts as though nothing has happened. Lacey forgives Martha because she attempts to apologise by making her breakfast and taking her shopping. Bourke added that Martha's actions bring Lacey to the realisation of what her mother is ""capable of and that her drink problem is worse than she thought"". Martha's drinking becomes more frequent in the weeks that followed. Norris told a writer from Inside Soap that her character is in ""terrible denial [because] she doesn't think that she drinks too much"". Martha is aware of the upset is causes her children, but she ""just laughs it off and makes a joke out of the situation"". Norris said that it was ""awful"" of Martha, as her drinking begins to affect Callum and Lacey in different ways. As Lacey is only fifteen, not being able to wake her mother up leaves her ""particularly scared"". But Callum is ""really angry"" and when Martha regains consciousness he tells her that he ""has had enough"" and will not take any more of her behaviour. In July 2012, Norris appeared on The Wright Stuff, explaining that she researched the storyline during filming with help from Hollyoaks bosses. ""I did as much [research] as I could. Fortunately for me, I haven't had that kind of lifestyle - I'm not a big boozer myself, and it wasn't a big thing in my family. ""But I was really lucky, while we were filming, to come into contact with somebody who was a teenager with a mother who had a serious alcohol problem. He shared some stories with me, and nobody should have to go through that, particularly at that age. And unfortunately she did pass away and left the family in devastation.""Martha decides to stop drinking alcohol and begins to rebuild her life. Norris told Kilkelly that it would be positive message if Martha never drank again. She noted Martha will always be an alcoholic and would dislike Martha having occasional drinks. Norris preferred portraying the storyline to addressed correctly and preferably when it conveys the effects on families.Martha takes a dislike to Ash's boyfriend Ally Gorman (Dan O'Connor). Susan Hill from the Daily Star reported that everyone had been fooled by Ally and Martha helps to expose it after preventing Ally sleeping with Lacey. A spokesperson for the show stated: ""Martha does what any mum would do when she catches them together and all hell breaks loose. Ally has no choice but to admit everything. Lacey is distraught and struggles to come to terms with it all.""


=== Departure ===
Martha's remaining on-screen children, Ash and Callum, were killed-off during October 2013. The storyline saw Martha arriving at their memorial service drunk and accuses Ash's boyfriend Will Savage (James Atherton) of killing her. Digital Spy released an article announcing that Martha vows to expose Will's lies. When Leah Barnes (Ela-May Demircan) hands Martha a necklace belonging to the deceased Anna Savage (Saskia Wickham) she questions how she came to be in its possession. She explains that Will was hiding it in Martha's flat and is not disabled as he claims to be. Martha realises the extent of Will's lies. Atherton told Digital Spy's Kilkelly that Martha begins to uncover the truth that he murdered Anna and Texas Longford (Bianca Hendrickse-Spendlove). Martha tells Dennis Savage (Joe Tracini) and Dodger Savage (Danny Mac) of her suspicions and they decide to expose him. But Will overhears there conversation, Atherton said ""the wheels are really starting to come off the wagon for him, so he acts in the only way he knows how."" Martha's discoveries culmulate with Will taking Martha and his family hostage. The show aired the Martha's final scenes on 8 November 2013, when she leaves to stay with her sister and Lacey. Norris had to keep her departure a secret until transmission. Norris told Kilkelly that ""I was originally only meant to be in Hollyoaks for a few episodes, so to be asked to stay for two years was a blessing."" While Kilkelly noted that Martha was determined to move forward with her remaining family.


== Storylines ==
Martha first appears when she asks Callum where he has been overnight. She assumes that he spent the night with Maddie Morrison (Scarlett Bowman) when he was actually helping homeless George Smith (Steven Roberts) out. Martha agrees to let George stay with her for aslong as he needs to. When Martha finds a new home, she goes missing leaving Callum and Ash to sort out the moving. She then welcomes home her youngest daughter, Lacey. Martha embarraces Ash by going on a drunken night out with her friends.

Martha takes the money for herself to pay the bills and Lacey uses this against her to have more freedom.
When Martha gets drunk again her children force her to leave the house. Ash invites her boyfriend Ally to move in. Martha returns and tells her children that she is back for good. Martha becomes suspicious of Ally as does Callum. When Martha gets drunk Ally insults her which makes her more determined to rid of him. Martha pretends to be drunk and Ally uses the opportunity to be nasty to her, thinking she will not remember. But as Martha needs to expose him after it is discovered he has lied about his identity.

The deaths of her children Callum and Ash devastate Martha and she turns up at a memorial for Ash drunk, she begins to suspect Will was responsible for the deaths of Anna and Texas.

Martha decides there is nothing to stay in Hollyoaks for and after saying goodbye to the Savages she leaves the village to go and live with her sister and Lacey.


== Reception ==
Laura Morgan from All About Soap said that Martha ""if there were ever an award for soap's worst mum then Hollyoaks' Martha Kane would be a sure-fire contender. Immature, irresponsible, alcoholic… The list just goes on and on."" Morgan stated that Martha should confront her problems and pay her bills. Martha's ""reckless behaviour"" has a ""massive effect"" on Callum and it was not his responsibility to sort Martha's problems. The writer concluded that Martha would not solve her problems because ""it'll be left to Callum to pick up the pieces while she drowns her sorrows in another bottle of cheap plonk!"" In a poll run by Hollyoaks' official website to discover the best mum out of Martha, Myra McQueen (Nicole Barber-Lane) and Diane O'Connor (Alex Fletcher), Martha received the fewest votes, with over 240 votes and only 3% of the total votes. A writer from TV Magazine said that drinking champagne around Martha was not the greatest idea because she ""is struggling to stay away from the demon drink"". The writer was unsurprised that ""troubled Martha"" cannot resist a drink and falls ""off the wagon big time"". They concluded that ""one thing's for sure - it's going to be a while before the Kane's are playing happy families again."" A writer from the Metro said that Martha had a ""gentle exit"" which was a ""more low-key fashion"" than the more dramatic departures Hollyoaks had been airing in 2013. They added that many viewers were disappointed that Norris had left. Kilkelly opined that the character left in ""high regard"". A reporter from What's on TV said it was a shock exit and also agreed that the character left on a ""high"".

Burnbank Fell,"Burnbank Fell is a small hill in the west of the English Lake District. It is the most westerly of the Loweswater Fells, a group of low grassy hills just south of Loweswater. It is predominantly grassy, with sprawling flanks and a broad ridge connecting it to Blake Fell. It can be climbed from Lamplugh in the west, or from Waterend on the lakeshore.


== Topography ==
The Western Fells occupy a triangular sector of the Lake District, bordered by the River Cocker to the northeast and Wasdale to the southeast. To the west, the hills diminish toward the coastal plain of Cumberland. At the central hub of the high country are Great Gable and its satellites, while two principal ridges fan out on either flank of Ennerdale—the western fells being, in effect, a great horseshoe around this long wild valley. Burnbank Fell and the other Loweswater Fells form the extremity of the northern arm.
The Loweswater Fells have been compared to the digits of a hand, radiating out southwestward from the ""palm"" centred on Loweswater village. From the west, these are Burnbank Fell, Blake Fell, Gavel Fell, Hen Comb and Mellbreak, the ""thumb"".
Burnbank Fell marks the northwestern perimeter of the Lakeland Fells, its feet set on the boundary of the National Park. Beyond lie the valley of the River Marrom and the industrial towns of the coastal plain. Beyond the park boundary is the low double top of Mockerkin How (810 ft) standing above Mockerkin Tarn. A natural water body, the Tarn is known for its water lilies, is stocked with eel, pike and perch, and is associated with several local legends, including that of a sunken town.The northeastern flanks of Burnbank Fell are much steeper, with some crags on the upper slopes overlooking Loweswater. Lower down the fellside is Holme Wood, an attractive background to views across the lake. Holme Beck runs down through the trees, forming the boundary between Burnbank Fell and Blake Fell to the south. High up in the woods is Holme Force, an attractive parallel pair of waterfalls.A west ridge drops from the summit across an easy grassy saddle to Owsen Fell (1,342 ft), generally considered a part of Burnbank Fell, although some guidebooks differ. Owsen Fell descends to the village of Lamplugh, with conifer plantations on its lower slopes. All drainage from Owsen Fell and the western slopes flows to the River Marron and ultimately the Derwent.


== Geology ==
The summit area is composed of the laminated mudstone and siltstone of the Kirk Stile Formation. The eastern slopes show outcropping of the Loweswater Formation of greywacke sandstone turbidities.The Ordnance Survey Explorer map series shows abandoned mine levels above Wisenholme Beck and some surface extraction near the summit. Wainwright shows a further old level on the eastern slopes.


== Summit ==
The top of Burnbank Fell is a rounded grassy dome, the summit marked by an old fence post and small cairn. The Lakeland view is greatly restricted by Blake Fell, although there is a vista of the Northern and North Western Fells. Loweswater is hidden by the slope, but Crummock Water comes into view a few paces to the northeast. The view of the coast, Isle of Man, Solway Firth and Criffel is uninterrupted.


== Ascents ==
From Lamplugh, the obvious line is up Owsen Fell, although there is doubt over right of access. From Waterend at the head of Loweswater, the route starts via Hudson Place farm and passes into Holme Wood; various paths can then be taken to the summit. Two paths contour the fell on this side: one on the lakeshore, and another 'terrace' above the woods. Both provide pleasant walking. Fangs Brow farm can be used as an access point to the terrace path from the north.

FOREST,"FOREST (short for ""Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco"") is a United Kingdom smokers' rights group primarily funded by the tobacco industry which campaigns against what it sees as ""excessive regulation"" of smoking and tobacco products.


== Early history ==
In 1978, Air Chief Marshal Sir Christopher Foxley-Norris approached the major British tobacco companies regarding a possible Tobacco Consumers' Association. Foxley-Norris, a pipe and cigar smoker, said that he was concerned about the increasing interference by 'the Government and other do-gooding bodies' in people's lives, and that he was surprised that the industry had not put up any co-ordinated response to anti-smoking measures. He added that, having retired from the RAF in 1974, he was seeking a salaried position in such an organisation to supplement his pension.At around the same time, Lieutenant-General Sir Geoffrey Charles Evans, a cigarette smoker and formerly General Secretary of the National Union of Retail Tobacconists made similar proposals to industry figures.
The Tobacco Advisory Committee (TAC), the then British tobacco industry trade association, agreed that the time was right to launch a pro-smoking group. TAC stated that the new organisation would need to 'be closely controlled and supported by the industry, but be seen to be sufficiently independent to maintain its credibility'.After some debate as to whether Evans or Foxley-Norris should run the group, FOREST was launched on 19 June 1979, with Foxley-Norris chairman and Evans chief executive, the men being the group's first two members.
Soon after launch, a March 1980 TAC memo showed that the tobacco industry felt that there was confusion about the organisation's purpose, doubts as to the effectiveness of FOREST's activities, and continuing uncertainty as to whether it should endeavour to recruit a mass membership or continue to serve the industry directly. Further doubts were expressed over FOREST's direction by TAC figures in 1981, with some companies questioning whether to continue funding the group, or to establish a different, more effective group.
A model for a pro-smoking pressure group was agreed by TAC members, and it was further agreed that this model would be applied to the existing FOREST organisation, rather than attempting to establish a new pro-smoking group. The restructured FOREST would require a new chief executive to replace Evans, and would not only react to news and tobacco control developments, but would seek to make its own news in the form of conducting research and lobbying. Individual members were seen as 'desirable', but not essential.


== Leadership and influence ==
FOREST's dependence on tobacco industry funding has ensured considerable industry influence upon its leadership and direction. The Tobacco Advisory Council selected Foxley-Norris as the first Chairman of FOREST in 1979, and when, by 1981, FOREST was felt by the TAC members to be ineffective, Stephen Eyres was selected as Director of a restructured organisation. From this point on, the leadership of FOREST has tended to be drawn from amongst elements of the libertarian movement.
The 1981 restructuring proposal stated that 'If money invested [in FOREST] is to be properly effective then control and management are essential' and that contact between the Executive Director of FOREST and the Tobacco Advisory Council should be made ""on an almost daily basis."" However, given that 'nobody of worth to a campaigning organisation can be run on too tight a rein', funding would be guaranteed on an annual basis.Evans continued to be involved for some time until dying in 1987. Eyres, meanwhile, was suffering from increasing ill-health as a result of HIV, and Chris Tame was recruited to succeed both as the organisation's effective leader in 1988; a non-smoker, Tame voiced a concern about the potential wider impact of measures to reduce exposure from second-hand smoke, arguing from a libertarian perspective that individuals’ right to make their own health decisions may need defending.Foxley-Norris remained a public figurehead until retiring in 1989, and was replaced by Lord Harris of High Cross, general director of the Institute of Economic Affairs, and pipe smoker. In September 1989 Eyres, still employed by FOREST, was accused of misusing Forest funds to buy first class flights to Australia and a property in Spain. The tobacco industry was keen to avoid any publicity and Eyres' resignation, effective as of 1 October 1989, and an agreement not to discuss the circumstances of the termination of his employment, was confirmed in a High Court judgement, of November 1989. Eyres died in 1990.Harris remained as chairman of FOREST until his death in 2006, while Tame, who took over from Eyres as Director of Forest, continued in the position until 1995, when he was removed by the tobacco industry following concerns about his approach. Eyres was replaced by Marjorie Nicholson, who had previously been the organisation's campaign manager, standing for Parliament at the 1994 Dudley West by-election under the FOREST name.The current director, Simon Clark, took over from Nicholson in 1999. Launching a spin-off campaign entitled 'The Free Society', a more general campaign against the perceived 'nanny state', Clark stated 'If people wish to eat themselves to death by eating too much fatty food that has to be their choice'.


== Media profile ==
Foxley-Norris was interviewed on 25 July 1979 by BBC London, criticising measures such as smoke-free regulations which had been introduced on Glasgow public transport and asking members of the public to join FOREST at the cost of £1/year.FOREST spokespeople continue to appear on television and radio in the United Kingdom and are quoted by British newspapers and broadcasters as representatives of a pro-tobacco viewpoint. Despite this media visibility, FOREST's internal communications to the tobacco industry have argued that its real successes ""cannot be publicised"":

Measuring FOREST purely in terms of media coverage denies the existence of other work in which it is engaged but which cannot be publicised. In short, if others can be persuaded to ""sing the same tune"" this is of more value than anything that might be said by the tobacco industry itself, or FOREST.
Less direct techniques have also been made use of to maximise media impact while promoting an appearance of independence from the tobacco industry. This is acknowledged in FOREST's 1985 Directors' report, stating that “the arms-length relationship with the industry has worked to the benefit of both parties” and noting that letter-writers were ""retained"" to provide an active local media presence.


== Funding and membership ==
Marketing itself as the ""voice and friend of the smoker"", FOREST has nevertheless been described as an astroturf front group created and primarily funded by the tobacco industry. Its establishment was planned by the Tobacco Advisory Committee, the British tobacco industry trade association. At a 1979 meeting, the Tobacco Advisory Committee discussed the launch of FOREST as well as ways to maintain its appearance of independence.After its founding, membership campaigns were not successful in recruiting a broad support base which could make the organisation self-financing. In one instance, 10,000 cigarette retailers were solicited to join FOREST, but only four joined. Financial support from the tobacco industry thus remains the main source of funding for FOREST.


== Notable supporters ==
While opposing proposals to restrict smoking in public places, FOREST attracted the support of celebrity smokers including artist David Hockney, inventor Trevor Baylis, musician Joe Jackson, chef Antony Worrall Thompson, and politician Claire Fox. Its more recent campaign to reverse smoke-free workplace regulations in licensed premises lists several politicians as supporters (see below).


== Developments following the smoking ban ==
In February 2006, FOREST lost its fight against comprehensive smoke-free workplace regulations in England, achieved via a House of Commons free vote and subsequently implemented on 1 July 2007. Complementing smoke-free workplace regulations already introduced in Scotland (March 2006), Northern Ireland and Wales (both April 2007), these included all pubs, bars, cafés and restaurants, private members' clubs and any indoor workplace. Following this UK-wide defeat, FOREST has undertaken to continue to lobby under a 'freedom of choice' banner and in 2010 launched an Irish branch, Forest Eireann – the Republic of Ireland having instituted nationwide smoke-free workplace regulations in March 2004.
Concern about the potential impact of smoke-free regulations upon the income of publicans and licensees was a theme in FOREST's subsequent opposition to smoke-free workplace measures. FOREST launched its 'Save Our Pubs and Clubs' Campaign in 2009, with Greg Knight, Conservative MP, and Anthony Worrall-Thompson in attendance. It was backed by David Clelland, Labour MP, John Hemming, Liberal Democrat MP, and Nigel Farage MEP, the leader of UKIP. The campaign called for pubs and clubs to be able to choose whether to allow smoking and listed as supporters the Working Men's Club and Institute Union, the Adam Smith Institute, thinktank Progressive Vision and the Manifesto Club.

== Rediscovery ==
Like most of Lyford's early films, it was presumed lost until it was discovered in his former Seattle home over 80 years later. KING-TV reported that the film may have never left Lyford's basement, which he would use as an auditorium to show his films. After the rediscovery, Lyford's family asked Seattle composer Ed Hartman to create a score for the film. As the Earth Turns made its theatrical premiere at the Seattle International Film Festival in 2019. LA Weekly wrote that by October 2019, the rediscovered film ""played at over 100 film festivals worldwide and garnered many awards along the way"".

Veronica Sobukwe,"Zondeni Veronica Sobukwe OLS (27 July 1927 – 15 August 2018) was a South African nurse who played an integral role in the Defiance Campaign. Her husband, Robert Sobukwe, was a prominent political dissident. Her family was constantly harassed by the police.


== Background ==
Veronica Sobukwe (née Mate) was born on July 27, 1927, in Hlobane, KwaZulu-Natal. Sobukwe was a trainee nurse at Victoria Hospital in Lovedale, Eastern Cape. Victoria Hospital was established in 1898 through the Lovedale Missionary Institution and it was the first hospital in South Africa to train black nurses. While Zondeni Sobukwe was a trainee, she got involved in a labour dispute with hospital management.
The dispute escalated to strike action and Sobukwe was one of the leaders, which caught the attention of Robert Sobukwe who was the president of the Student Representative Council at Fort Hare University in 1949. Zondeni Sobukwe was expelled from Lovedale College the same year for her participation in the Victoria Hospital Strike. After her expulsion, the Fort Hare ANC Youth League sent Sobukwe to Johannesburg to deliver a letter to Walter Sisulu to bring to his attention the struggles of the nurses in Alice.
On 6 June 1954, she married Robert Sobukwe and they had four children, Miliswa, Dinilesizwe, Dalindyebo and Dedanizizwe. After they married she worked at Jabavu Clinic in Soweto. While her husband was in prison, Zondeni unsuccessfully petitioned Jimmy Kruger and Prime Minister B.J. Vorster, demanding the release of her husband so that he could get medical treatment at home In a bid to find the truth about the cause of her husband’s death, Zondeni Sobukwe testified to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in King Williams Town on May 12, 1997.She died on 15 August 2018 at the age of 91 years after a long illness.


== Honours ==
The ANC's Regional Headquarters in Nelson Mandela Bay was renamed Florence Matomela House in November 2012. Ms Angie Motshekga, then Minister of Basic Education and President of the ANC Women's League described Florence Matomela, at the Florence Mathomela Memorial Lecture, as having battled 'triple oppression', i.e. colonial, patriarchal and class domination. The Red Location Museum in New Brighton held a year-long exhibition dedicated to these women of the liberation struggle, by paying tribute to Florence Matomela, Nontuthuzelo Mabala, Veronica Sobukwe, Lilian Diedricks and Nosipho Dastile.

Mount Royal (Florida),"Mount Royal (8PU35) is a U.S. archaeological site close to where the St. Johns River exits from Lake George in Putnam County, Florida. It is located three miles (5 km) south of Welaka, in the Mount Royal Airpark, off County Road 309 on the eastern bank of the St. Johns River. The site consists of a large sand mound and several nearby middens.The Mount Royal site was occupied beginning about 4,000 years ago. The site was largely unoccupied from 500 BCE until 750 CE. Mount Royal was occupied again after 750, and after 1050 it grew into the main town of an important chiefdom with connections to the Mississippian culture. The town lost importance after 1300, but it was still there when Europeans first entered the area in the 1560s. At that time it was part of the Timucua chiefdoms of Utina and Agua Dulce. In 1616, Enacape became the administrative center of Agua Dulce, and the Spanish established the mission of San Antonio de Enacape. The town and mission remained until after 1656.


== Location ==
The Mount Royal site is located on the east side of the St. Johns River between Lake George, to the south, and Little Lake George. The site is on the north side of a short section of the river that flows to the west (the river in general flows northward). The most prominent feature is a large sand mound about 90 metres (300 ft) from the river. A causeway or avenue, still visible at the end of the 19th century, but since obscured, ran north from the mound to a rectangular pond. The mound is on a 1 acre (0.40 ha) parcel now owned by the State of Florida. The surrounding area, including the middens and village area, is part of the Mount Royal Airpark residential development.


== Archaeological investigation ==


=== The Bartrams ===
The Mount Royal site entered the archaeological record in 1766, when John Bartram and his son William visited it. William returned to the site 15 years later. They found a sand mound 100 yards (90 m) in diameter, and almost 20 feet (6 m) tall. The Bartrams described an ""avenue"" running north from the mound, with raised banks on the sides. The avenue was ""level as a floor"", 60 yards (50 m) wide, and extended about .75 miles (1.2 km) to a rectangular pond 100 yards (91.4 m) wide and 150 yards (137.2 m) long. John Bartram speculated the pond had been a borrow pit from which the sand in the mound had been taken.On William's return to the site, he found that an orange grove and palms and live oaks that had flanked the avenue in 1766 had been cleared in preparation for planting. The 19th-century archaeologist Samuel Foster Haven called the reports published by the Bartrams ""the earliest 'careful and intelligent' descriptions of a native American Indian mound.""


=== Clarence Moore ===
In 1891, Clarence Bloomfield Moore, a self-trained archaeologist, investigated shell middens along the St. Johns River. In 1893, he returned to the St. Johns and began excavating sand mounds, including the one at Mount Royal. In two short seasons (two-and-a-half weeks in 1893 and three weeks in 1894), Moore excavated and backfilled almost all of the sand mound. He published his findings at Mount Royal in two parts in the Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia in 1894, a total of more than 250 pages.Before Moore's first visit, the mound had been plowed over and the sides of the mound had slumped down, raising the ground level around the mound. As a result, Moore encountered problems with measuring the height of the mound. He estimated that the mound was 4.9 m. high, and stated that it had been much higher originally. He reported that the mound was 168 metres (551 ft) in circumference. The connection of the avenue to the mound was no longer discernible. He reported that the avenue was 12 to 20 yards (11 to 18 m) wide, flanked by berms  that were an average of 2.5 feet (0.76 m) high and 12 feet (3.7 m) wide.


=== Later investigations ===
In the early 1950s John Goggin and his students from the University of Florida collected potsherds and other artifacts from the ground surface of the middens and other areas surrounding the Mount Royal mound. By this time the avenue reported by the Bartrams and Moore was no longer visible from the ground, but did show up in aerial photos. With the area slated for residential development, B. Calvin Jones of the Florida Bureau of Archaeological Research conducted investigations in 1983, 1994 and 1995, including shovel tests and focused excavations of selected areas.


== The mound ==
Moore found charcoal mixed with the sand at the bottom of the mound. While not saying so explicitly for Mount Royal, Moore speculated in his reports on excavations of other sand mounds along the St. Johns River that fire was used in rituals at the beginning of mound construction. Other than some white sand at the base, the mound was constructed with yellow sand from the immediate vicinity. Sand that had been colored by the addition of hematite was found in layers in the mound. Artifacts were more common in the hematite-tinted sand layers than in untinted sand. The entire mound had been capped with hematite-colored sand, in a layer up to 2.1 metres (6.9 ft) deep in one section. Moore described the color of the hematite-tinted sand as ""crushed strawberry"", ""brick red"", and ""Indian red"".Most of the artifacts found in the mound were in the top 2.1 metres (6.9 ft) of the mound. A few artifacts were found in the base of the mound, but the part of the mound from 0.3 to 2.7 metres (1.0 to 8.9 ft) above ground level was almost completely bare of artifacts. Burials were found throughout the mound, but the skeletons were always decayed, and in many cases only teeth were left.


== Early occupation ==
The first inhabitants of the Mount Royal site, who arrived around 2000 BCE, practiced the culture of the Orange period. Orange period people were hunter-gatherers, harvesting shellfish and fish from the rivers and coastal waters of northeastern Florida, gathering wild plants, and hunting. The Orange period began with the appearance of pottery in northeastern Florida, shortly after the appearance of pottery in coastal Georgia and South Carolina, the earliest in North America.Around 500 BCE the Orange period developed into the St. Johns culture. During the first part of the St. Johns Culture, called St. Johns I, There were many sites occupied along the St. Johns River, but there is no evidence that the Mount Royal site was occupied during that period. Beginning around 750, as the St. Johns I transitioned into the St. Johns II period, people returned to occupy the Mount Royal site. Moore noted that St. Johns Check Stamped pottery, diagnostic of the St Johns II period, was present from the beginning of construction of the Mount Royal mound. While St. Johns people were probably already raising squashes and other plants in gardens, the cultivation of maize was likely introduced early in the St. Johns II period.


== Political complexity ==
After about 1050, chiefdoms developed among the people of the St. Johns culture. The chief of a larger village would exert political power over smaller villages in the area. Particular powerful chiefs would form confederations with other chiefdoms. The most powerful chiefdoms, wielding political and religious power, became ceremonial centers, with their status demonstrated by the construction of mounds. Mount Royal was such a ceremonial center for centuries, perhaps the largest over a wide area along the St. Johns River.On May 7, 1973, Mount Royal was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

Elbaite,"Elbaite, a sodium, lithium, aluminium boro-silicate, with the chemical composition Na(Li1.5Al1.5)Al6Si6O18(BO3)3(OH)4, is a mineral species belonging to the six-member ring cyclosilicate tourmaline group.
Elbaite forms three series, with dravite, with fluor-liddicoatite, and with schorl. Due to these series, specimens with the ideal endmember formula are not found occurring naturally. 
As a gemstone, elbaite is a desirable member of the tourmaline group because of the variety and depth of its colours and quality of the crystals. Originally discovered on the island of Elba, Italy in 1913, it has since been found in many parts of the world.  In 1994, a major locality was discovered in Canada, at O'Grady Lakes in the Yukon.  
Elbaite forms in igneous and metamorphic rocks and veins in association with lepidolite, microcline, and spodumene in granite pegmatites; with andalusite and biotite in schist; and with molybdenite and cassiterite in massive hydrothermal replacement deposits.
Elbaite is allochromatic, meaning trace amounts of impurities can tint crystals, and it can be strongly pleochroic. Every color of the rainbow may be represented by elbaite, some exhibiting multicolor zonation. Microscopic acicular inclusions in some elbaite crystals show the Cat's eye effect in polished cabochons. 


== Elbaite varieties ==
Colorless: achroite variety (from Ancient Greek  άχρωμος (ákhrōmos) 'colorless')
Red or pinkish-red: Rubellite variety (from ruby)
Light blue to bluish green: Brazilian indicolite variety (from indigo)
Green: Brazilian verdelite variety (from emerald)
Watermelon tourmaline is a zoned variety with a reddish center surrounded by a green outer zone resembling watermelon rind, evident in cross-sectional slices of prisms, often displaying curved sides.

Pallur Eman,"Pallūr Ēman Nāyar(Poligar Eman"" ""Pulior Eman"" (died 1820 in Malaya) was a Nayar lord of southern Wayanad, north east Kerala, India. He was involved in the Cotiote War (1793–1806), a conflict between the Cotiote princely ruler Pazhassi and the British East India Company. In 1799, Eman fought with the British. In 1802, Eman became a double agent for Pazhassi, who was his overlord.


== British recruitment and espionage ==
The British considered Eman ""a man of considerable property and rank"".: 889  In 1799, he was an advisor to the British with a wage of 200 rupees per year. Eman encamped with Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington and in 1801, his services to the British contributed to their capture of Periya. In 1801 and 1802, Pazhassi struggled. His once trusted commander, Pazhayamviden Chandu betrayed Pazhassi to the British. As the British tracked him down, the Raja and his men kept up a running engagement with his pursuers. During this time, Eman continued to support Pazhassi as a double agent. Eman's older brother, Pallur Rayrappan Nayar also supported Pazhassi until his arrest by the British in 1806.


=== Discovery, escape and tribal alliance ===
When the British captured the fort at Panamaram in 1802, Eman's double agent status was discovered and he fled to join Pazhassi. The British put a reward of 1,000 pagodas on Eman's capture. Eman persuaded the Mullukurumba, a warrior tribe, to support Pazhassi.: 545 


=== Attack on Malabar sub-jail. ===
On 23 March 1802, Eman and 1,000 rebels marched through the Thamarasseri Defile towards Calicut and overran the sub-jail. The 250 sub-jail guards were captured of killed. Ammunition and stores were stolen. Many of the freed prisoners joined Eman. McLeod, collector of Malabar, resigned. 
Eman continued to fight the British. Pashassi died in November 1805 and his leadership assumed by his nephew. Eman was captured by the British in 1806.


=== Imprisonment, exile and death ===
Eman was tried at Seringapatam and sentenced to death. His sentence was subsequently commuted to life imprisonment. In about 1807, Eman and his brother were sent to Prince of Wales Island (Penang Island).: 555  Some of the rebels were released in late 1819 but not Eman. The British felt that if he were released to his homeland, he would stir discontent. Eman died at Prince of Wales Island in 1820.: 894

Ib Braase,"Ib Valentin Braase (7 August 1923 – 18 March 2009) was a Danish sculptor. From 1968, he lived and worked in Marcoussis near Paris.


== Early life, family and education ==
Born in Stege on the island of Møn, Braase was the son of the stonemason Christian Braase who introduced him to the art of stonework. As a 14-year-old, he crafted his first busts of family members. He studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1949 to 1954 under Einar Utzon-Frank and Aksel Jørgensen, becoming the assistant of Astrid Noack with whom he created small stone figures.


== Career ==
After initially working with stone, in the 1950s Braase turned to bronze, embarking on a new, experimental phase which soon led him to abandon the traditional approach of the Academy. One of his acclaimed works from this period is Barneværelset (1969) which juxtaposes iron profiles and belongs to his bronze creations in an open structure. In 1968, he moved to Marcoussis near Paris where he developed an independent approach with unconventional materials such as bronze, iron, wood, zinc and paint in works resembling unfinished furniture or makeshift scaffolding.Braase exhibited widely from 1949, first as a member of the Den Polychrome association, then in Den Frie Udstilling and Grønningen. His work has also been presented in numerous solo exhibitions in Denmark and France.


== Awards ==
In 1968, Braase was awarded the Eckersberg Medal and, in 1985, the Thorvaldsen Medal.

Wendy Poole Park,"Wendy Poole Park is a small triangular plot of parkland near the waterfront in the Downtown Eastside in Vancouver, British Columbia. The land is at Alexander Street and the Main Street
Overpass, and it was named by the Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation for a young aboriginal woman who was murdered nearby in 1989. The park contains a memorial boulder inscribed with information about Poole.


== Wendy Poole ==
Wendy Poole was a member of the Tsay Keh Dene (""People of the Mountains"") a First Nations group from Northern B.C., near what is now the city of Prince George, British Columbia. She had moved to Vancouver, and was murdered on the second floor of a Downtown Eastside housing coop on January 26, 1989. Her body was later found in a nearby garbage dump. A man was arrested in connection with her death and was later acquitted. The murder case remains unsolved by police.


== History of the memorial ==
A coalition of First Nations, community groups, and individuals from the DTES campaigned, along with Roslyn Cassells, the then Party Commissioner of the Green Party of Canada, to name this small waterfront park after Wendy Poole. The proponents of the proposal hoped that the park would bring awareness to the unsolved cases of the missing women in the Downtown Eastside, and contribute to a healing process with First Nations people in the city.The official dedication ceremony was held on February 14, 2001, with
representation from Wendy Poole's family. The February date was picked to coordinate with the Annual DTES Women's Memorial March held on that date.
The 'Spirit's Rising Memorial Society' is joining women and youth at risk in a totem carving project, to be displayed in the park.Downtown Eastside activist Don Larson was involved in the campaign from the beginning.  Larson is a well-respected Vancouver social justice activist.

== Medal of Honor citation ==
The President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR to

for service as set forth in the following CITATION:

For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving with the Third Battalion, Twenty-Third Marines, Fourth Marine Division, in combat against enemy Japanese forces during the seizure of Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands, February 26, 1945. Promptly destroying a stubborn 20-mm. antiaircraft gun and its crew after assuming the duties of a bazooka man who had been killed, Private First Class Jacobson waged a relentless battle as his unit fought desperately toward the summit of Hill 382 in an effort to penetrate the heart of Japanese cross-island defenses. Employing his weapon with ready accuracy when his platoon was halted by overwhelming enemy fire on February 26, he first destroyed two hostile machine-gun positions, then attacked a large blockhouse, completely neutralizing the fortification before dispatching the five-man crew of a pillbox and exploding the installation with a terrific demolitions blast. Moving steadily forward, he wiped out an earth-covered rifle emplacement and, confronted by a cluster of similar emplacements which constituted the perimeter of enemy defenses in his assigned sector, fearlessly advanced, quickly reduced all six positions to a shambles, killed ten of the enemy and enabled our forces to occupy the strong point. Determined to widen the breach thus forced, he volunteered his services to an adjacent assault company, neutralized a pillbox holding up its advance, opened fire on a Japanese tank pouring a steady stream of bullets on one of our supporting tanks and smashed the enemy tank's gun turret in a brief but furious action culminating in a single-handed assault against still another blockhouse and the subsequent neutralization of its firepower. By his dauntless skill and valor, Private First Class Jacobson destroyed a total of sixteen enemy positions and annihilated approximately seventy-five Japanese, thereby contributing essentially to the success of his division's operations against the fanatically defended outpost of the Japanese Empire. His gallant conduct in the face of tremendous odds enhanced and sustained the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

On 12 February 2020, the United Nations published a database of 112 companies helping to further Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as well as in the occupied Golan Heights. These settlements are considered illegal under international law. First International Bank of Israel was listed on the database on account of its ""provision of services and utilities supporting the maintenance and existence of settlements"" and ""banking and financial operations helping to develop, expand or maintain settlements and their activities"" in these occupied territories.On 5 July 2021, Norway's largest pension fund KLP said it would divest from First International Bank of Israel together with 15 other business entities implicated in the UN report for their links to Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.

EBS d.a.c.,"EBS d.a.c. is a small financial institution in Ireland registered as a designated activity company.


== History ==
EBS Building Society was founded in 1935 by Alexander McCabe, Thomas J. O'Connell and other teachers to provide affordable housing finance for teachers and other civil servants.EBS was one of the last two Irish building societies owned by their members but since July 2011, has been a subsidiary of AIB Bank. With 70 branches throughout Ireland, EBS offers residential, personal loans, savings accounts and investment products.
It formerly did not offer current accounts using its own resources and instead through an agreement with Allied Irish Banks, an ATM card service was operated using AIB's Banklink system. This has now been withdrawn and a debit card is provided in conjunction with MasterCard.  Similarly, credit cards were formerly offered in conjunction with MBNA.

In 2003, the EBS building society promoted a controversial product which involved parents remortgaging the family home to help their children buy a property.  Called FamilyFirst, the product was aimed at first-time buyers and enabled parents to help raise the deposit on a starter home by taking out a loan with no repayments due for three years. After this period the parent takes on the repayments or the child can decide to pay off the parents' loan. The product drew extensive criticism when EBS promoted it in adverts in 2003. Critics charged that the product was a form of emotional blackmail and that parents were being forced into debt to fund their children's lifestyle.In 2006, EBS became a tied insurance agent of Irish Life, PLC for the provision of life and investments products. All investment products sold through EBS are managed by Irish Life Investment Managers.
During 2007, a wholly owned subsidiary, Haven Mortgages, was established. Haven was intended to focus exclusively on the broker market as a separate lender in its own right.
On 18 September 2009, Fergus Murphy, the chief executive of Educational Building Society (EBS) admitted his financial institution had played a key role in helping to create an overheated economy. Eithne Tinney, a former EBS director has described a “feeding frenzy” which existed between lenders and developers in the lead-up to the crash and the bonus system in banks as “crazy”.  She said “The bonus system in banks is crazy. You get a bonus for lending money out. There is no incentive for getting it back in. Such a system encourages greed and recklessness.”  Ms Tinney was a member of the board of EBS from 2000 until 2007. She told the banking inquiry how she was “removed” from the board as she was considered a “troublemaker”.
On 1 July 2011, EBS Building Society ceased to exist and, after being granted a banking licence, and demutualising, EBS Building Society became EBS Ltd., a subsidiary of AIB.
On 12 September 2016, EBS Limited re-registered as a designated activity company (d.a.c.), as required under the Companies Act 2014. The registered name of the legal entity is now EBS d.a.c.


== Controversy ==
In June 2010, the European Commission authorised the Irish government to inject €875 million as emergency rescue aid into the society to combat the post-2008 Irish banking crisis. This bailout money came with the demand that the EBS must submit a restructuring plan to the commission. The European Commissioner for Competition, Joaquín Almunia, said ""EBS needs a significant recapitalisation to comply—and to continue to comply in the coming years—with capital requirement rules.""
By March 2011 the total external bailout needed  to save the institution was estimated at €1.5 billion.The former head of EBS Building Society Fergus Murphy told the Oireachtas Banking Inquiry in 2015 there was a “very reasonable chance” the institution could have made it through the crash without being nationalised and merged with AIB if it had not got involved in land development and commercial property lending.
“They got into it because they felt they were losing relevance” and “needed to create new profit pools”, Mr Murphy told the committee. EBS became involved in commercial property lending in 2001/02 and in land and development loans in 2005. The combined loan book amounted to €1.7 billion by the end of 2007. Mr Murphy took over as chief executive of EBS in January 2008 and ceased its lending to commercial property and land development projects.
On 18 June 2018, EBS admitted that a further 500 customers were caught up in its tracker mortgage scandal, which brought the number of its customers affected to 2,400.
In November 2020 a financial advisor who was an employee of EBS and who stole a total €271,000 from elderly and vulnerable people was jailed for eleven months at Sligo Circuit Court.  The court heard she had ""not paid back a penny"". Her victims said she had abused her position as a financial adviser and a ""trusted employee.""
In June 2022, the Central Bank of Ireland reprimanded and fined EBS d.a.c. trading as EBS €13.4m for a series of significant and long-running failings in the treatment of its mortgage customers, between August 2004 and June 2020. As a result of this investigation alone, EBS has admitted to 36 separate regulatory breaches. This fine was separate from the more than the €105m that EBS has been required to pay to date in redress, compensation and account balance adjustments to impacted customers.

Sasak people,"The Sasak people live mainly on the island of Lombok, Indonesia, numbering around 3.6 million (85% of Lombok's population). They are related to the Balinese in language and ancestry, although the Sasak are predominantly Muslim while the Balinese are predominantly Hindu. Sasak people who practice pre-Islamic beliefs are also known as Sasak Boda in reference to the name of the Sasak people's original religion, Bodha.


== Etymology ==
There is a possibility that the origin of the name Sasak came from the word sak-sak, which means ""boat"". In the Nagarakretagama, the word Sasak is mentioned together as one with Lombok Island, namely Lombok Sasak Mirah Adhi. According to local tradition, it is believed that the word Sasak came from sa'-saq which means ""the one"". Followed by the word Lombok which originates from the word Lomboq, meaning ""straight"". Hence by combining the words together Sa'-saq Lombok, it means ""something that's straight"". Other translations also includes ""a straight road"". Lombok Sasak Mirah Adhi is taken from the Nagarakretagama (Desawarnana) literature, a scripture written by Mpu Prapanca that records the power and rule of the Majapahit kingdom. The word Lombok in Kawi means ""straight"" or ""honest"", Mirah means ""gem"", Sasak means ""statement"", and Adhi means ""something that's good"" or ""utmost"". Therefore Lombok Sasak Mirah Adhi means ""honesty is the gem that states out goodness"".


== History ==
Little is known about Sasak history except that Lombok was placed under direct rule of the Majapahit prime Minister, patih Gajah Mada. Islam arrived into the area around the 15th century. The Sasaks converted to Islam between the late 16th century to early 17th century under the influence of Pangeran Prapen (Sunan Prapen), the son of Raden Paku (Sunan Giri) or Sunan Giri himself and the Muslim Makassarese, frequently mixing basic Islamic beliefs with Hindu-Buddhist beliefs, thus creating the Wetu Telu religion. Lombok was conquered by the Gelgel Balinese kingdom in the early 16th century, thus bringing a large population of Balinese to Lombok. The Balinese population of Lombok today is about 300,000, 10–15% of Lombok's population. The Balinese have also strongly influenced the Wetu Telu religion of Lombok.


== Language ==
The Sasak language is an Austronesian language that belongs to the group of Indonesian type language. Specifically, Sasak belongs to the languages of Western Indonesia which also means it is  closely related to the languages of Java and  Bali. There are also a number of Sasak dialect in various regions such as Kuto-Kute (North Sasak), Meno-Mene (Central Sasak), Meriak-Meriku (Central South Sasak), Ngeno-Ngene (Central East Sasak, Central West Sasak), Ngeto-Ngete (Northeast Sasak) and so on.


== Religion ==
According to the Babad Lombok, an account of the history of the Sasak people, they were first introduced to Islam by Sunan Prapen, who invaded Lombok and forced much of the people to convert to Islam. This conversion was only nominal, and as soon as he left most converted back to Hinduism. Upon hearing this Prapen returned to Lombok with the support of the Raden of Sumuliya and the Raden of Salut and succeeded. It was observed that a part of the people fled into the mountains, now called the Bodhas, while the rest were subjected to Muslim rule and converted. This record is supported by anthropological observations, such as the fact that the Bodhas point to central plain villages as their homeland, and make pilgrimage there.Most of the Sasaks today are adherents of the Lima Waktu version of Islam. Lima Waktu or Five Times signifies the five daily prayers which Muslims are required to do.
The term Lima Waktu is used to distinguish them from the Sasaks who are practitioners of Wetu Telu or Three Symbols who only pray three times a day. Orthodox Islamic teachers generally instruct adherents to pray five times a day.
Large numbers of people adhering to the Wetu Telu faith can be still found throughout the island, especially in the village of Bayan, where the religion originated. Large Wetu Telu communities can be still found in Mataram, Pujung, Sengkol, Rambitan, Sade, Tetebatu, Bumbung, Sembalun, Senaru, Loyok and Pasugulan. A small minority of Sasaks called the Bodha (estimated population: 8,000) are mainly found in the village of Bentek and on the slopes of Gunung Rinjani. They are totally untouched by Islamic influence and worship animistic gods, incorporating some Hindu and Buddhist influences in their rituals and religious vocabulary. This group of Sasak, due in part to the name of their tribe, are recognized as Buddhists by the Indonesian government.
The Bodha have the same magico-religious officials and institutions as the Wetu Telu (with the exception of course of the Kiyai, the Wetu Telu religious official dealing with all aspects of the Wetu Telu religion which mixes Islam and animism). The Bodhas recognize the existence of five main gods, the highest of which is Batara Guru, followed by Batara Sakti and Batara Jeneng with their wives Idadari Sakti and Idadari Jeneng, though they also believe in spirits and ghosts. The Bodha religion is also to some extent influenced by both Hindu and Buddhist concepts. Of late, many of them have embraced Theravada Buddhism due to the effort and support from Buddhist missionaries.

Noble savage,"In Western anthropology, philosophy, and literature, the noble savage is a stock character who is uncorrupted by civilization. As such, the noble savage symbolizes the innate goodness and moral superiority of a primitive people living in harmony with Nature. In the heroic drama of the stageplay The Conquest of Granada by the Spaniards (1672), John Dryden represents the noble savage as an archetype of Man-as-Creature-of-Nature.The intellectual politics of the Stuart Restoration (1660–1688) expanded Dryden's playwright usage of savage to denote a human wild beast and a wild man. Concerning civility and incivility, in the Inquiry Concerning Virtue, or Merit (1699), the philosopher Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury, said that men and women possess an innate morality, a sense of right and wrong conduct, which is based upon the intellect and the emotions, and not based upon religious doctrine.In the philosophic debates of 17th-century Britain, the Inquiry Concerning Virtue, or Merit was the Earl of Shaftesbury's ethical response to the political philosophy of Leviathan (1651), in which Thomas Hobbes defended absolute monarchy and justified centralized government as necessary because the condition of Man in the apolitical state of nature is a ""war of all against all"", for which reason the lives of men and women are ""solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short"" without the political organization of people and resources. The European Hobbes gave as example the American Indians as people living in the bellicose state of nature that precedes tribes and clans organizing into the societies that compose a civilization.In 18th-century anthropology the term noble savage then denoted nature's gentleman, an ideal man born from the sentimentalism of moral sense theory. In the 19th century, in the essay ""The Noble Savage"" (1853) Charles Dickens rendered the noble savage into a rhetorical oxymoron by satirizing the British romanticisation of Primitivism in philosophy and in the arts made possible by moral sentimentalism.


== Origins ==
16th centuryThe stock character of the noble savage originated from the essay ""Of Cannibals"" (1580), about the Tupinambá people of Brazil, wherein the philosopher Michel de Montaigne presents ""Nature's Gentleman"", the bon sauvage counterpart to civilized Europeans in the 16th century.

17th centuryThe first usage of the term noble savage in English literature occurs in John Dryden's stageplay The Conquest of Granada by the Spaniards (1672), about the troubled love of the hero Almanzor and the Moorish beauty Almahide, in which the protagonist defends his life as a free man by denying a prince's right to put him to death, because he is not a subject of the prince:

18th centuryBy the 18th century, Montaigne's predecessor to the noble savage, nature's gentleman was a stock character usual to the sentimental literature of the time, for which a type of non-European Other became a background character for European stories about adventurous Europeans in the strange lands beyond continental Europe. For the novels, the opera, and the stageplays, the stock of characters included the ""Virtuous Milkmaid"" and the ""Servant-More-Clever-Than-the-Master"" (e.g. Sancho Panza and Figaro), literary characters who personify the moral superiority of working-class people in the fictional world of the story.
In English literature, British North America was the geographic locus classicus for adventure and exploration stories about European encounters with the noble savage natives, such as the historical novel The Last of the Mohicans: A Narrative of 1757 (1826), by James Fenimore Cooper, and the epic poem The Song of Hiawatha (1855), by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, both literary works presented the primitivism (geographic, cultural, political) of North America as an ideal place for the European man to commune with Nature, far from the artifice of civilisation; yet in the poem “An Essay on Man” (1734), the Englishman Alexander Pope portrays the American Indian thus:

To the English intellectual Pope, the American Indian was an abstract being unlike his insular European self; thus, from the Western perspective of ""An Essay on Man"", Pope's metaphoric usage of poor means ""uneducated and a heathen"", but also denotes a savage who is happy with his rustic life in harmony with Nature, and who believes in deism, a form of natural religion — the idealization and devaluation of the non-European Other derived from the mirror logic of the Enlightenment belief that ""men, everywhere and in all times, are the same"".

19th centuryLike Dryden's noble savage term, Pope's phrase ""Lo, the Poor Indian!"" was used to dehumanize the natives of North America for European purpose, and so justified white settlers' conflicts with the local Indians for possession of the land. In the mid-19th century, the journalist-editor Horace Greeley published the essay ""Lo! The Poor Indian!"" (1859), about the social condition of the American Indian in the modern United States:

I have learned to appreciate better than hitherto, and to make more allowance for the dislike, aversion, contempt wherewith Indians are usually regarded by their white neighbors, and have been since the days of the Puritans. It needs but little familiarity with the actual, palpable aborigines to convince anyone that the poetic Indian — the Indian of Cooper and Longfellow — is only visible to the poet's eye. To the prosaic observer, the average Indian of the woods and prairies is a being who does little credit to human nature — a slave of appetite and sloth, never emancipated from the tyranny of one animal passion, save by the more ravenous demands of another.
As I passed over those magnificent bottoms of the Kansas, which form the reservations of the Delawares, Potawatamies, etc., constituting the very best corn-lands on Earth, and saw their owners sitting around the doors of their lodges at the height of the planting season, and in as good, bright planting weather as sun and soil ever made, I could not help saying: ""These people must die out — there is no help for them. God has given this earth to those who will subdue and cultivate it, and it is vain to struggle against His righteous decree.""
Moreover, during the American Indian Wars (1609–1924) for possession of the land, European white settlers considered the Indians ""an inferior breed of men"" and mocked them by using the terms ""Lo"" and ""Mr. Lo"" as disrespectful forms of address. In the Western U.S., those terms of address also referred to East Coast humanitarians whose noble-savage conception of the American Indian was unlike the warrior who confronted and fought the frontiersman. Concerning the story of the settler Thomas Alderdice, whose wife was captured and killed by Cheyenne Indians, The Leavenworth, Kansas, Times and Conservative newspaper said: ""We wish some philanthropists, who talk about civilizing the Indians, could have heard this unfortunate and almost broken-hearted man tell his story. We think [that the philanthropists] would at least have wavered a little in their [high] opinion of the Lo family.""


== Cultural stereotype ==


=== The Roman Empire ===
In Western literature, the Roman book De origine et situ Germanorum (On the Origin and Situation of the Germans, AD 98), by the historian Publius Cornelius Tacitus, introduced the anthropologic concept of the noble savage to the Western World; later a cultural stereotype who featured in the exotic-place tourism reported in the European travel literature of the 17th and the 18th centuries.


=== Al-Andalus ===
The 12th-century Andalusian novel The Living Son of the Vigilant (Ḥayy ibn Yaqẓān, 1160), by the polymath Ibn Tufail, explores the subject of natural theology as a means to understand the material world. The protagonist is a wild man isolated from his society, whose trials and tribulations lead him to knowledge of Allah by living a rustic life in harmony with Mother Nature.


=== Kingdom of Spain ===
In the 15th century, soon after arriving to the Americas in 1492, the Europeans employed the term savage to dehumanise the indigènes (noble-savage natives) of the newly discovered ""New World"" as ideological justification for the European colonization of the Americas, called the Age of Discovery (1492–1800); thus with the dehumanizing stereotypes of the noble savage and the indigène, the savage and the wild man the Europeans granted themselves the right to colonize the natives inhabiting the islands and the continental lands of the northern, the central, and the southern Americas.The conquistador mistreatment of the indigenous peoples of the Viceroyalty of New Spain (1521–1821) eventually produced bad-conscience recriminations amongst the European intelligentsias for and against colonialism. As the Roman Catholic Bishop of Chiapas, the priest Bartolomé de las Casas witnessed the enslavement of the indigènes of New Spain, yet idealized them into morally innocent noble savages living a simple life in harmony with Mother Nature. At the Valladolid debate (1550–1551) of the moral philosophy of enslaving the native peoples of the Spanish colonies, Bishop de las Casas reported the noble-savage culture of the natives, especially noting their plain-manner social etiquette and that they did not have the social custom of telling lies.


=== Kingdom of France ===
In the intellectual debates of the late-16th and the 17th centuries, philosophers used the racist stereotypes of the savage and the good savage as moral reproaches of the European monarchies fighting the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) and the French Wars of Religion (1562–1598). In the essay ""Of Cannibals"" (1580), Michel de Montaigne reported that the Tupinambá people of Brazil ceremoniously eat the bodies of their dead enemies, as a matter of honour, whilst reminding the European reader that such wild man behavior was analogous to the religious barbarism of burning at the stake: ""One calls ‘barbarism’ whatever he is not accustomed to."" The academic Terence Cave further explains Montaigne's point of moral philosophy:

The cannibal practices are admitted [by Montaigne] but presented as part of a complex and balanced set of customs and beliefs which ""make sense"" in their own right. They are attached to a powerfully positive morality of valor and pride, one that would have been likely to appeal to early modern codes of honor, and they are contrasted with modes of behavior in the France of the wars of religion, which appear as distinctly less attractive, such as torture and barbarous methods of execution.
As philosophic reportage, ""Of Cannibals"" applies cultural relativism to compare the civilized European to the uncivilized noble savage. Montaigne's anthropological report about cannibalism in Brazil indicated that the Tupinambá people were neither a noble nor an exceptionally good folk, yet neither were the Tupinambá culturally or morally inferior to his contemporary, 16th-century European civilization. From the perspective of Classical liberalism of Montaigne's humanist portrayal of the customs of honor of the Tupinambá people indicates Western philosophic recognition that people are people, despite their different customs, traditions, and codes of honor. The academic David El Kenz explicates Montaigne's background concerning the violence of customary morality:

In his Essais ... Montaigne discussed the first three wars of religion (1562–63; 1567–68; 1568–70) quite specifically; he had personally participated in [the wars], on the side of the [French] royal army, in southwestern France. The [anti-Protestant] St. Bartholomew's Day massacre [1572] led him to retire to his lands in the Périgord region, and remain silent on all public affairs until the 1580s. Thus, it seems that he was traumatized by the massacre. To him, cruelty was a criterion that differentiated the Wars of Religion [1562–1598] from previous conflicts, which he idealized. Montaigne considered that three factors accounted for the shift from regular war to the carnage of civil war: popular intervention, religious demagogy, and the never-ending aspect of the conflict. ...
He chose to depict cruelty through the image of hunting, which fitted with the tradition of condemning hunting for its association with blood and death, but it was still quite surprising, to the extent that this practice was part of the aristocratic way of life. Montaigne reviled hunting by describing it as an urban massacre scene. In addition, the man–animal relationship allowed him to define virtue, which he presented as the opposite of cruelty. ... [As] a sort of natural benevolence based on ... personal feelings.

Montaigne associated the [human] propensity to cruelty toward animals, with that exercised toward men. After all, following the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, the invented image of Charles IX shooting Huguenots from the Louvre Palace window did combine the established reputation of the King as a hunter, with a stigmatization of hunting, a cruel and perverted custom, did it not?


=== Literature ===
The themes about the person and persona of the noble savage are the subjects of the novel Oroonoko: Or the Royal Slave (1688), by Aphra Behn, which is the tragic love story between Oroonoko, an African prince, and the beautiful Imoinda, a European woman. At Coramantien, Ghana, the protagonist is deceived and delivered into the Atlantic slave trade (16th–19th centuries), and Oroonoku becomes a slave of plantation colonists in Surinam (Dutch Guiana, 1667–1954). In the course of his enslavement, Oroonoko meets the woman who narrates to the reader the life and love of Prince Oroonoko, his enslavement, his leading a slave rebellion against the Dutch planters of Surinam, and his consequent execution by the Dutch colonialists.Despite Behn having written the popular novel for money, Oroonoko proved to be political-protest literature against slavery, because the story, plot, and characters followed the narrative conventions of the European romance novel. In the event, the Irish playwright Thomas Southerne adapted the novel Oroonoko into the stage play Oroonoko: A Tragedy (1696) that stressed the pathos of the love story, the circumstances, and the characters, which consequently gave political importance to the play and the novel for the candid cultural representation of slave-powered European colonialism.


== Uses of the stereotype ==


=== Romantic primitivism ===
In the 1st century AD, in the book Germania, Tacitus ascribed to the Germans the cultural superiority of the noble savage way of life, because Rome was too civilized, unlike the savage Germans. The art historian Erwin Panofsky explains that:

There had been, from the beginning of Classical speculation, two contrasting opinions about the natural state of man, each of them, of course, a ""Gegen-Konstruktion"" to the conditions under which it was formed. One view, termed ""soft"" primitivism in an illuminating book by Lovejoy and Boas, conceives of primitive life as a golden age of plenty, innocence, and happiness — in other words, as civilized life purged of its vices. The other, ""hard"" form of primitivism conceives of primitive life as an almost subhuman existence full of terrible hardships and devoid of all comforts — in other words, as civilized life stripped of its virtues.
In the novel The Adventures of Telemachus, Son of Ulysses (1699), in the “Encounter with the Mandurians” (Chapter IX), the theologian François Fénelon presented the noble savage stock character in conversation with civilized men from Europe about possession and ownership of Nature:

On our arrival upon this coast we found there a savage race who ... lived by hunting and by the fruits which the trees spontaneously produced. These people ... were greatly surprised and alarmed by the sight of our ships and arms and retired to the mountains. But since our soldiers were curious to see the country and hunt deer, they were met by some of these savage fugitives.The leaders of the savages accosted them thus: “We abandoned for you, the pleasant sea-coast, so that we have nothing left, but these almost inaccessible mountains: at least, it is just that you leave us in peace and liberty. Go, and never forget that you owe your lives to our feeling of humanity. Never forget that it was from a people whom you call rude and savage that you receive this lesson in gentleness and generosity. ... We abhor that brutality which, under the gaudy names of ambition and glory, ... sheds the blood of men who are all brothers. ... We value health, frugality, liberty, and vigor of body and mind: the love of virtue, the fear of the gods, a natural goodness toward our neighbors, attachment to our friends, fidelity to all the world, moderation in prosperity, fortitude in adversity, courage always bold to speak the truth, and abhorrence of flattery. ...
If the offended gods so far blind you as to make you reject peace, you will find, when it is too late, that the people who are moderate and lovers of peace are the most formidable in war.”
In the 18th century, British intellectual debate about Primitivism used the Highland Scots as a local, European example of a noble savage people, as often as the American Indians were the example. The English cultural perspective scorned the ostensibly rude manners of the Highlanders, whilst admiring and idealizing the toughness of person and character of the Highland Scots; the writer Tobias Smollett described the Highlanders:

They greatly excel the Lowlanders in all the exercises that require agility; they are incredibly abstemious, and patient of hunger and fatigue; so steeled against the weather, that in traveling, even when the ground is covered with snow, they never look for a house, or any other shelter but their plaid, in which they wrap themselves up, and go to sleep under the cope of heaven. Such people, in quality of soldiers, must be invincible. . . .


=== Thomas Hobbes ===
The imperial politics of Western Europe featured debates about soft primitivism and hard primitivism worsened with the publication of Leviathan, or The Matter, Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiasticall and Civil (1651), by Thomas Hobbes, which justified the central-government regime of absolute monarchy as politically necessary for societal stability and the national security of the state:

Whatsoever therefore is consequent to a time of War, where every man is Enemy to every man; the same is consequent to the time, wherein men live without other security, than what their own strength, and their own invention shall furnish them withall. In such condition, there is no place for Industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain; and consequently no Culture of the Earth; no Navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by Sea; no commodious Building; no Instruments of moving, and removing such things as require much force; no Knowledge of the face of the Earth; no account of Time; no Arts; no Letters; no Society; and which is worst of all, continuall feare, and danger of violent death; And the life of man, solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short.
In the Kingdom of France, critics of Crown and Church risked censorship and summary imprisonment without trial, and primitivism was political protest against the repressive imperial règimes of Louis XIV and Louis XV. In his travelogue of North America, the writer Louis-Armand de Lom d'Arce de Lahontan, Baron de Lahontan, who had lived with the Huron Indians (Wyandot people), ascribed deist and egalitarian politics to Adari, a Canadian Indian who played the role of noble savage for French explorers:

Adario sings the praises of Natural Religion. ... As against society, he puts forward a sort of primitive Communism, of which the certain fruits are Justice and a happy life. ... [The Savage] looks with compassion on poor civilized man — no courage, no strength, incapable of providing himself with food and shelter: a degenerate, a moral cretin, a figure of fun in his blue coat, his red hose, his black hat, his white plume and his green ribands. He never really lives, because he is always torturing the life out of himself to clutch at wealth and honors, which, even if he wins them, will prove to be but glittering illusions. ... For science and the arts are but the parents of corruption. The Savage obeys the will of Nature, his kindly mother, therefore he is happy. It is civilized folk who are the real barbarians.
Interest in the remote peoples of the Earth, in the unfamiliar civilizations of the East, in the untutored races of America and Africa, was vivid in France in the 18th century. Everyone knows how Voltaire and Montesquieu used Hurons or Persians to hold up the [looking] glass to Western manners and morals, as Tacitus used the Germans to criticize the society of Rome. But very few ever look into the seven volumes of the Abbé Raynal's History of the Two Indies, which appeared in 1772. It is however one of the most remarkable books of the century. Its immediate practical importance lay in the array of facts which it furnished to the friends of humanity in the movement against negro slavery. But it was also an effective attack on the Church and the sacerdotal system. ... Raynal brought home to the conscience of Europeans the miseries which had befallen the natives of the New World through the Christian conquerors and their priests. He was not indeed an enthusiastic preacher of Progress. He was unable to decide between the comparative advantages of the savage state of nature and the most highly cultivated society. But he observes that ""the human race is what we wish to make it"", that the felicity of Man depends entirely on the improvement of legislation, and ... his view is generally optimistic.


=== Benjamin Franklin ===
Benjamin Franklin was critical of government indifference to the Paxton Boys massacre of the Susquehannock in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania in December 1763. Within weeks of the murders, he published A Narrative of the Late Massacres in Lancaster County, in which he referred to the Paxton Boys as ""Christian white savages"" and called for judicial punishment of those who carried the Bible in one hand and a hatchet in the other.When the Paxton Boys led an armed march on Philadelphia in February 1764, with the intent of killing the Moravian Lenape and Mohican who had been given shelter there, Franklin recruited associators including Quakers to defend the city, and led a delegation that met with the Paxton leaders at Germantown outside Philadelphia. The marchers dispersed after Franklin convinced them to submit their grievances in writing to the government.In his 1784 pamphlet Remarks Concerning the Savages of North America, Franklin especially noted the racism inherent to the colonists using the word savage as a synonym for indigenous people:

""Savages"" we call them, because their manners differ from ours, which we think the perfection of civility; they think the same of theirs.
Franklin praised the way of life of indigenous people, their customs of hospitality, their councils of government, and acknowledged that while some Europeans had foregone civilization to live like a ""savage"", the opposite rarely occurred, because few indigenous people chose ""civilization"" over ""savagery"".


=== Jean-Jacques Rousseau ===

Like the Earl of Shaftesbury in the Inquiry Concerning Virtue, or Merit (1699), Jean-Jacques Rousseau likewise believed that Man is innately good, and that urban civilization, characterized by jealousy, envy, and self-consciousness, has made men bad in character. In Discourse on the Origins of Inequality Among Men (1754), Rousseau said that in the primordial state of nature, man was a solitary creature who was not méchant (bad), but was possessed of an ""innate repugnance to see others of his kind suffer.""Moreover, as the philosophe of the Jacobin radicals of the French Revolution (1789–1799), ideologues accused Rousseau of claiming that the noble savage was a real type of man, despite the term not appearing in work written by Rousseau; in addressing The Supposed Primitivism of Rousseau’s Discourse on Inequality (1923), the academic Arthur O. Lovejoy said that:

The notion that Rousseau’s Discourse on Inequality was essentially a glorification of the State of Nature, and that its influence tended to wholly or chiefly to promote “Primitivism” is one of the most persistent historical errors.
In the Discourse on the Origins of Inequality, Rousseau said that the rise of humanity began a ""formidable struggle for existence"" between the species man and the other animal species of Nature. That under the pressure of survival emerged le caractère spécifique de l'espèce humaine, the specific quality of character, which distinguishes man from beast, such as intelligence capable of ""almost unlimited development"", and the faculté de se perfectionner, the capability of perfecting himself.Having invented tools, discovered fire, and transcended the state of nature, Rousseau said that ""it is easy to see. . . . that all our labors are directed upon two objects only, namely, for oneself, the commodities of life, and consideration on the part of others""; thus amour propre (self regard) is a ""factitious feeling arising, only in society, which leads a man to think more highly of himself than of any other."" Therefore, ""it is this desire for reputation, honors, and preferment which devours us all . . . this rage to be distinguished, that we own what is best and worst in men — our virtues and our vices, our sciences and our errors, our conquerors and our philosophers — in short, a vast number of evil things and a small number of good [things]""; that is the aspect of character ""which inspires men to all the evils which they inflict upon one another.""Men become men only in a civil society based upon law, and only a reformed system of education can make men good; the academic Lovejoy explains that:

For Rousseau, man's good lay in departing from his ""natural"" state — but not too much; ""perfectability"", up to a certain point, was desirable, though beyond that point an evil. Not its infancy but its jeunesse [youth] was the best age of the human race. The distinction may seem to us slight enough; but in the mid-eighteenth century it amounted to an abandonment of the stronghold of the primitivistic position. Nor was this the whole of the difference. As compared with the then-conventional pictures of the savage state, Rousseau's account, even of this third stage, is far less idyllic; and it is so because of his fundamentally unfavorable view of human nature quâ human. ... [Rousseau's] savages are quite unlike Dryden's Indians: ""Guiltless men, that danced away their time, / Fresh as the groves and happy as their clime"" or Mrs. Aphra Behn's natives of Surinam, who represented an absolute idea of the first state of innocence ""before men knew how to sin."" The men in Rousseau's ""nascent society"" already had 'bien des querelles et des combats"" [many quarrels and fights]; l'amour propre was already manifest in them ... and slights or affronts were consequently visited with vengeances terribles.
Rousseau proposes reorganizing society with a social contract that will ""draw from the very evil from which we suffer the remedy which shall cure it""; Lovejoy notes that in the Discourse on the Origins of Inequality, Rousseau:

declares that there is a dual process going on through history; on the one hand, an indefinite progress in all those powers and achievements which express merely the potency of man's intellect; on the other hand, an increasing estrangement of men from one another, an intensification of ill-will and mutual fear, culminating in a monstrous epoch of universal conflict and mutual destruction. And the chief cause of the latter process Rousseau, following Hobbes and [Bernard] Mandeville, found, as we have seen, in that unique passion of the self-conscious animal — pride, self esteem, le besoin de se mettre au dessus des autres [the need to put oneself above others]. A large survey of history does not belie these generalizations, and the history of the period since Rousseau wrote lends them a melancholy verisimilitude. Precisely the two processes, which he described have ... been going on upon a scale beyond all precedent: immense progress in man's knowledge and in his powers over nature, and, at the same time, a steady increase of rivalries, distrust, hatred and, at last, ""the most horrible state of war"" ... [Moreover, Rousseau] failed to realize fully how strongly amour propre tended to assume a collective form ... in pride of race, of nationality, of class.


=== Charles Dickens ===
In 1853, in the weekly magazine Household Words, Charles Dickens published a negative review of the Indian Gallery cultural program, by the portraitist George Catlin, which then was touring England. About Catlin's oil paintings of the North American natives, the critic Charles Baudelaire said that ""He [Catlin] has brought back alive the proud and free characters of these chiefs; both their nobility and manliness.""
Despite European idealization of the noble savage as a type of morally superior man, in the essay “The Noble Savage” (1853), Dickens expressed repugnance for the American Indians and their way of life, because they were dirty and cruel and continually quarrelled among themselves. In the satire of romanticised primitivism Dickens showed that the painter Catlin, the Indian Gallery of portraits and landscapes, and the white people who admire the idealized American Indians or the bushmen of Africa are examples of the term noble savage used as a means of Othering a person into a racialist stereotype. Dickens begins by dismissing the noble savage as not being a distinct human being:

To come to the point at once, I beg to say that I have not the least belief in the Noble Savage. I consider him a prodigious nuisance and an enormous superstition. . . . I don't care what he calls me. I call him a savage, and I call a savage a something highly desirable to be civilized off the face of the Earth. . . . 
The noble savage sets a king to reign over him, to whom he submits his life and limbs without a murmur or question, and whose whole life is passed chin deep in a lake of blood; but who, after killing incessantly, is in his turn killed by his relations and friends the moment a grey hair appears on his head. All the noble savage's wars with his fellow-savages (and he takes no pleasure in anything else) are wars of extermination — which is the best thing I know of him, and the most comfortable to my mind when I look at him. He has no moral feelings of any kind, sort, or description; and his ""mission"" may be summed up as simply diabolical.
Dickens ends his cultural criticism by reiterating his argument against the romanticized persona of the noble savage:

To conclude as I began. My position is that if we have anything to learn from the Noble Savage it is what to avoid. His virtues are a fable; his happiness is a delusion; his nobility, nonsense. We have no greater justification for being cruel to the miserable object, than for being cruel to a WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE or an ISAAC NEWTON; but he passes away before an immeasurably better and higher power than ever ran wild in any earthly woods, and the world will be all the better when this place [Earth] knows him no more.

In 1860, the physician John Crawfurd and the anthropologist James Hunt identified the racial stereotype of the noble savage as an example of scientific racism, yet, as advocates of polygenism — that each race is a distinct species of Man — Crawfurd and Hunt dismissed the arguments of their opponents by accusing them of being proponents of ""Rousseau's Noble Savage"". Later in his career, Crawfurd re-introduced the noble savage term to modern anthropology, and deliberately ascribed coinage of the term to Jean-Jacques Rousseau.


== Modern perspectives ==


=== Opponents of primitivism ===
In War Before Civilization: the Myth of the Peaceful Savage (1996), the archaeologist Lawrence H. Keeley said that the ""widespread myth"" that ""civilized humans have fallen from grace from a simple, primeval happiness, a peaceful golden age"" is contradicted and refuted by archeologic evidence that indicates that violence was common practice in early human societies. That the noble savage paradigm has warped anthropological literature to political ends. Moreover, the anthropologist Roger Sandall likewise accused anthropologists of exalting the noble savage above civilized man, by way of designer tribalism, a form of romanticised primitivism that dehumanises Indigenous peoples into the cultural stereotype of the indigène peoples who live a primitive way of life demarcated and limited by tradition, which discouraged Indigenous peoples from cultural assimilation into the dominant Western culture.


=== Supporters of primitivism ===
In ""The Prehistory of Warfare: Misled by Ethnography"" (2006), the researchers Jonathan Haas and Matthew Piscitelli challenged the idea that the human species is innately bellicose, and that warfare is an occasional activity by a society, but is not an inherent part of human culture. Moreover, the UNESCO's Seville Statement on Violence (1986) specifically rejects claims that the human propensity towards violence has a genetic basis.Anarcho-primitivists, such as the philosopher John Zerzan, rely upon a strong ethical dualism between Anarcho-primitivism and civilization; hence, ""life before domestication [and] agriculture was, in fact, largely one of leisure, intimacy with nature, sensual wisdom, sexual equality, and health."" Zerzan's claims about the moral superiority of primitive societies are based on a certain reading of the works of anthropologists, such as Marshall Sahlins and Richard Borshay Lee, wherein the anthropologic category of primitive society is restricted to hunter-gatherer societies who have no domesticated animals or agriculture, e.g. the stable social hierarchy of the American Indians of the north-west North America, who live from fishing and foraging, is attributed to having domesticated dogs and the cultivation of tobacco, that animal husbandry and agriculture equal civilization.

Peter Gay. ""Breeding is Fundamental"". Book Forum. April / May 2009","In Western anthropology, philosophy, and literature, the noble savage is a stock character who is uncorrupted by civilization. As such, the noble savage symbolizes the innate goodness and moral superiority of a primitive people living in harmony with Nature.

Loliolus,"Loliolus is a genus of squid from the family Loliginidae from the Indo-Pacific region. The genus is divided into two subgenera Loliolus and Nipponololigo. They are small squids of less than 150mm in mantle length which have an expanded tentacular club. This club has 4 series of suckers. The sucker rings have plate-like teeth which are square in shape all around them. The males' hectocotylus has a ventral crest which is created by the fusion of the protective membrane with the ventral series of papillae and this crest completely obscures the conical shape of the papillae. The mantle is rounded posteriorly and lacks the posterior tail-like lobe while the fins are positioned on the rear of the mantle and extend to the posterior tip of the mantle. Their eggs are small and the males' spermatophore has a short cement body. They do not possess photophores. The two subgenera are distinguished by the hectocotylus which in Loliolus encompasses the entire arm and there are no unmodified suckers while in Nipponololigo the arm is only partly hectocotylsed and has normal suckers at its base.


== Species ==
The following species are classified as belonging to Loliolus:
Subgenus Loliolus (Loliolus) Steenstrup, 1856
Loliolus affinis Steenstrup, 1856 little Indian squid
Loliolus hardwickei (Gray, 1849) Steenstrup’s bay squid
Subgenus Loliolus (Nipponololigo) Natsukari, 1983
Loliolus beka (Sasaki, 1929) Beka squid
Loliolus japonica (Hoyle, 1885) Japanese squid
Loliolus sumatrensis (d'Orbigny in Férussac & d'Orbigny], 1835) Kobi squid

It originally comprised four elements, of which three survive, now all separated: a main panel of the Crucified Christ with the Virgin Mary, Saints and Angels which was bequeathed to the National Gallery, London, by Ludwig Mond, and a three-panel predella from which one panel is lost; the two surviving panels are Eusebius of Cremona raising Three Men from the Dead with Saint Jerome's Cloak in the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga, in Lisbon, and Saint Jerome saving Silvanus and punishing the Heretic Sabinianus in the North Carolina Museum of Art. 


== Background ==
This early work by Raphael was commissioned by the wool merchant Domenico Gavari as the altarpiece for his burial chapel in the south aisle of the church of San Domenico in Città di Castello, in Umbria, near Raphael's home town of Urbino.  The side chapel was dedicated to Saint Jerome, where most of the painting's original pietra serena stone frame survives including the inscribed date 1503.  Gavari was an associate of Andrea Baronci, for whom Raphael had already made the Baronci Altarpiece.  Gavari's first son Girolamo (Jerome) died young.


== Main panel ==
The main panel portrays the Crucifixion of Jesus, against a background of hills in the Umbrian countryside, with a view of Città di Castello in the distance.  Jesus looks peaceful even as he is dying on the cross, crowned with thorns and clad only in a loincloth that has an unusual red colour.  Above, a sun in gold leaf and moon in silver leaf appear together in the sky.  Two angels with flowing robes and scrolling ribbons at their waists, one floating to either side of the cross, are using gold chalices similar to communion vessels to catch the blood dripping from Jesus' nail-pierced hands and spurting from the wound in his side. To the proper right (Jesus' left) kneels Mary Magdalene, with John the Evangelist standing behind her.  To the proper left (Jesus' right) his mother Mary stands behind the kneeling Saint Jerome, who is holding a stone with which the hermit would piously beat his own chest.  
The two kneeling figures are both reverently contemplating Jesus on the cross, while the two standing figures are wringing their hands while looking out at the viewer.  A panel at the top of the cross bears the inscription ""INRI"", while the foot of the cross bears a Latin inscription in silver letters: ""RAPHAEL/ VRBIN / AS /.P.[INXIT]"" (""Raphael of Urbino painted this"").  The work is lit from the left, consistent with the illumination of the altarpiece by the windows in the chapel. 
The main panel measures 283.3 cm × 167.3 cm (111.5 in × 65.9 in) and is now housed in a 19th-century frame. The geometrical precision of the composition suggest it was laid out using a grid, using a rule and compasses to copy from a preparatory drawings.
A drawing of a kneeling person, perhaps a study for the figure of Mary Magdalene, is held by the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.
The painting was influenced by Perugino, whom Raphael knew while living in Perugia.  It is similar to Perugino's c.1502 Monteripido Altarpiece, made the convent of San Francesco al Monte at Monteripido near Perugia, a similar crucifixion scene which has two similar angels with ribbons catching the blood of Jesus is chalices, accompanied by four figures, two standing and two kneeling, including the Virgin Mary, John the Evangelist, and Mary Magdalene, but the fourth is Francis of Assisi rather than Saint Jerome.  In the Mond Crucifixion, Raphael has used Perugino's technique of cross-hatched shadows, but also used his fingers to smear and soften the wet paint in places, leaving some detectable fingerprints.  Vasari later famously commented that no one would have believed it was painted by Raphael rather than Perugino if he had not signed it.  


== Predella ==
The two surviving panels of the predella each measure approximately 26 cm × 43 cm (10 in × 17 in) and depict miracles from the life story of Saint Jerome from the Hierominianum of Giovanni d'Andrea.  Saint Jerome lived in the late 4th and early 5th century AD, so he could not have attended the crucifixion, but he is portrayed here as the patron saint of the chapel. 
One of the surviving predella panels has been in the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga in Lisbon since 1866.  It depicts Eusebius of Cremona raising Three Men from the Dead with Saint Jerome's Cloak
  Eusebius of Cremona was a close associate and active supporter of Jerome against the teachings of Origen.
The other surviving predella panel is in the North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh, North Carolina.  It depicts Saint Jerome saving Silvanus and punishing the Heretic Sabinianus.  Saint Jerome is holding back the arm of the executioner ready to behead bishop Silvanus, but the heretic Sabinianus has been miraculously decapitated instead.

			
			
		
		
			
			
		


== Provenance ==
The main panel was bought by Cardinal Fesch in 1808 for 2500 scudi, and replaced in the chapel by a copy.  At the Fesch sale in 1845, it was sold to the Principe di Canino, and quickly bought by Lord Ward (later Earl of Dudley).  It was then in several English collections, and eventually acquired by Ludwig Mond in 1892, after whose death in 1909 it was acquired by the National Gallery in 1924.
The predella panels seem to have been removed in the 17th century, and given as gifts to a visiting cardinal.  The panel in North Carolina was formerly in the collection of Sir Francis Cook at Doughty House, Richmond, London.


== Painting materials ==
The main panel was analyzed in the National Gallery London and the typical pigments of the Renaissance period were identified. He painted the Crucifixion among other pigments with natural ultramarine, lead-tin-yellow, verdigris, vermilion and ochres.

Bernard de Périgord,"Bernard de Périgord (died 1149) was the first bishop of the restored diocese of Zamora from 1121 until his death. He was born in the Périgord, a region in the north of the Duchy of Aquitaine in central France.
As a young man, Bernard accompanied Bernard de Sedirac, his countryman, to Spain and there entered the church of Toledo, where he became an archdeacon. In 1121 he was elected to replace the late Jérôme, also from Périgord, who had served as de facto bishop of Zamora since about 1102. Bernard began construction on the new cathedral of Zamora and reorganised the cathedral chapter. He created a diocesan administration from scratch and began the repoblación (officially-sponsored resettlement) of the region with Christians. All his surviving charters are fueros de población granting rights to, and establishing the responsibilities of, new settlers (pobladores).Bernard also oversaw the foundation of two monasteries in his diocese, including Valparaíso, one of the earliest Cistercian houses in Spain.

Jonah Barrington (judge),"Sir Jonah Barrington, K.C. (1756/57 – 8 April 1834), was an Irish lawyer, judge and politician. Jonah Barrington is most notable for his amusing and popular memoirs of life in late 18th-century Ireland; for his opposition to the Act of Union in 1800; and for his removal from the judiciary by both Houses of Parliament in 1830, still a unique event.


== Barrington family ==
Barrington was the third son, one of thirteen or sixteen children; six at least, and probably seven, were sons; of John Barrington, an impoverished Protestant gentleman landowner in County Laois and his wife Sibella French of Peterswell, County Galway. He was raised and schooled by his grandparents in Dublin and entered Trinity College Dublin in 1773, aged 16 but he left Trinity College without a degree.He joined the Irish Volunteers and supported the Irish Patriots in the early 1780s. His father raised and commanded two Corps; the Cullenagh Rangers and the Ballyroan Light Infantry. Barrington's elder brother commanded both the Kilkenny Horse and the Durrow Light Dragoons. Through his correspondence with General Hunt Walsh, Barrington's father secured him a commission in Walsh's regiment. Upon learning that the regiment was to be sent to America to fight in the ongoing conflict, and fearful of dying on some foreign battlefield, Barrington wrote to Walsh asking him to present the commission to another candidate instead, claiming that he himself was too tender to be of any real use. Barrington's fears proved well founded when his replacement, the only child of one of Walsh's friends, was killed in his first engagement.


== Career ==


=== Law and Parliament ===
He was called to the Irish bar in 1788 and in 1789 he married Catherine, daughter of Dublin mercer, Edward Grogan. They were to have seven children. The following year he entered by the purchase of the seat the pre-1801 Parliament of Ireland as MP for Tuam. He accepted a sinecure post in 1793 at the Dublin customhouse worth £1,000 p.a. generally supporting Henry Grattan and he took silk the same year. Barrington was a member of the Kildare Street Club in Dublin. Appointed an Admiralty court judge in 1798 he re-entered parliament the same year as member for Clogher and voted against the Act of Union in 1799–1800, rejecting Lord Clare's offer of the solicitor-generalship in 1799. In 1802 he unsuccessfully contested a seat for Dublin in the UK parliament.


=== Political legacy ===
Barrington's comments on the Act of Union had a continuing resonance with the Young Ireland, Fenian and Irish Parliamentary Party movements, which hoped to re-establish ""Grattan's Parliament"" in some way. In particular, his Rise and Fall of the Irish Nation (1833) provided the basis for this romantic idealisation of Grattan's Parliament adopted by the Irish Parliamentary Party from the 1880s.


=== Admiralty Court ===
Appointed an Admiralty court judge in 1798 at a salary of £500 he found there was little work to be done and his lack of a degree restricted other opportunities to support extravagant tastes. His award of a knighthood in 1807 brought no increased income. His court ordered the sale of two derelict vessels and he gave instructions that the proceeds were to go to his own bank account. In 1810 or 1811 he took his wife and family to England and from that time on his work in Ireland was carried out by surrogates. Still retaining his judgeship and salary he moved to France in 1814 to escape his creditors and never returned to Ireland.


=== Bankruptcy and loss of office ===
In 1828, commissioners learnt of his financial irregularities. Barrington crossed the channel to London and protested that he was innocent but would not answer the charges based on the documentary evidence produced by the commissioners. In 1830, a parliamentary commission recommended that he be removed from office, finding misappropriations of court funds in 1805, 1806 and 1810. Pursuant to a provision of the Act of Settlement of 1701, which sought to protect the independence of the judiciary, both Houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom voted for an Address to King William IV praying for his removal, and the King duly dismissed Barrington from office. By then, Barrington's first 1827 volume of memoirs had sold successfully, and they were republished and expanded (see below).
Barrington was the first judge removed from office under the Act of Settlement, and to this day, is the only judge in the United Kingdom to be so removed.


== Duel with Richard Daly ==
According to one of his sometimes spurious personal memoirs, on 20 March 1780. Barrington travelled to Donnybrook to duel with Richard Daly.
Daly had fought 16 duels in three years - three with swords and thirteen with pistols. Remarkably, he, and his opponents, had always escaped serious injury. Barrington had no pistols so he and his second, Richard Crosbie, had spent the previous night constructing a pair 'from old locks, stocks and barrels'. At Donnybrook, Daly's second, Jack Patterson, a nephew of the Chief Justice, approached Crosbie, explained that it was all a mistake and asked that the two shake hands. Barrington was in favour, but Crosbie would have none of it. Taking out a duelling handbook, he pointed to rule No.7 - 'No apology can be received after the parties meet, without a fire.'Taking up their positions Barrington lost no time in pressing the trigger and Daly staggered back, put his hand to his chest, and cried ""I'm hit, Sir."" The ball had not penetrated but had driven part of a brooch slightly into his breastbone. Barrington only then thought to inquire why the duel was even taking place. This time the rule book noted: ""If a party challenged accepts the challenge without asking the reason for it, the challenger is never bound to divulge it afterwards"".


== Memoirs ==
Barrington is most notable today for his memoirs which included scathing but humorous thumbnail portraits of contemporary Irish lawyers, judges and politicians during the last years of the Protestant Ascendancy. Personal sketches also includes vignettes on Irish people from every background. His works were reprinted with frequent additions and renamings as:

Historic Anecdotes and Secret Memoirs of the Legislative Union between Great Britain and Ireland (London: G. Robinson 1809);republished with a 2nd volume as: Historic Memoirs, Comprising Secret Records of the National Convention, the Rebellion, and the Union, with Delineations of the Principal Characters Connected with These Transactions, 2 vols. (London: R. Bentley & H. Colburn 1833 [1809–33])

Bentley 1832)reissued as (George Birmingham, intro.): Recollections of Jonah Barrington (Dublin: Talbot; London: T. Fisher Unwin  1918);Historic Memoirs of Ireland, 2 vols. (London: R. Bentley & H. Colburn 1833)
The Rise and Fall of the Irish Nation (Paris: G. G. Bennis 1833)2nd edn. (Dublin: James Duffy 1853)


== Criticism and literary resonance ==
Since his death Barrington's work has been quoted by a wide selection of editors, primarily following two themes; the political drama surrounding the Act of Union and the colourful nature of life in 1700s Ireland.

Frank O'Connor, ed., Book of Ireland (London: Fontana 1959 & edns.), was impressed by: ""Merry Christmas, 1778"" uninterrupted match of hard-going till the weather should break up ... hogshead of superior claret’ ... ‘the pipers plied their chants ... I shall never forget the attraction this novelty had for my youthful mind (p. 139); Sir Boyle Roche ... the most celebrated and entertaining anti-grammarian in the Irish Parliament (p. 183); on duelling Ough, thunder! ... how many holes did the villain want drilled in to his carcass? (p. 262); Crow Street theatre: immediately ... on being struck, he reeled, staggered, and fell very naturally, considering that it was his first death (p. 278).
Roy Foster: the racy Personal Sketches...confirmed him as the chief historian of the ""half-mounted gentlemen"" of Ireland.
W. B. Yeats: Mrs French, in the first section of Yeats's poem The Tower, is a character from Barrington's Recollections, where it is used to illustrate mutual attachment between the Irish peasantry and their landlords.
James Joyce: Tom Kernan makes reference to Barrington's Reminiscences (recte Recollections) in Ulysses: Must ask Ned Lambert to lend me those reminiscences of sir Jonah Barrington.
John Mitchel quoted Barrington in his History of Ireland, concerning the approach to the 1798 rebellion: Mr Pitt counted on the expertness of the Irish Government to effect a premature explosion. Free quarters were now ordered, to irritate the Irish population; slow tortures were inflicted, under the pretence of forcing confessions; the people were goaded and driven to madness (p. 264).
A Dictionary of Irish Writers (1985), ed. Brian Cleeve & Ann Brady, lists his Historic Anecdotes and Secret Memoirs of the Legislative Union between Great Britain and Ireland (1809).
A book of selections was published for the American market in 1967.

Powermad,"Powermad is an American thrash/speed metal band formed in Minneapolis in 1984. The group has been called an ""innovative and often forgotten speed metal band...who infused progressive metal styles and European styles into abstract American speed metal."" The band's intricate riff formulations were heavily influenced by thrash metal acts like Metallica and Testament. Vocalist Joel DuBay's singing is easily recognizable with his mixture of singing and high screams.


== History ==
Powermad formed in 1984 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and released an EP with demos on Combat Records in 1986.
They subsequently signed to Reprise Records and released The Madness Begins... in 1988. The release was mainly distributed via a promotional ad featured in some of the most popular metal magazines of the era. Readers were able to clip this ad and mail it in to Reprise for a free cassette copy of The Madness Begins.... A video for the song ""Terminator"" was aired on MTV at this time.
Their first and only full-length album until 2015, Absolute Power, was released in 1989. Other than a US tour opening for Overkill, a video featured on MTV of their single ""Nice Dreams"" and a cameo appearance in the David Lynch film Wild at Heart (where they go from playing their own music to Elvis Presley's with Nicolas Cage singing), Powermad never achieved notable commercial success. Their releases in the 1980s, however, were critically acclaimed and are considered collectors items today by fans of thrash and speed metal music.
In 2007 Powermad resumed touring and started working on a new full-length CD to be released sometime in the future. On February 9, 2008, the band updated their blog on MySpace with a link to download The Madness Begins... and Absolute Power as unprotected mp3s – these have since been removed. On June 23, 2011, Powermad updated their official website with a new design, and an announcement. A new song called Souls Descending was released on their website, and it was made available for download (music video, ogg and mp3) and on YouTube. The downloads are not available anymore, but the video is still on their YouTube channel. In the same update back in 2011 Powermad also announced that Dirk Verbeuren is now the band's drummer.
In late June 2015 the band announced their new proper Facebook page, and in October they announced a new website for their new album release.
The record Infinite, was released on October 9, 2015. The tracks were recorded in various studios (666 Studio, Assembly Line Studios and Die Crawling Studio), and all lyrics are written by Joel DuBay.
On the official Infinite-website media (CD, vinyl and digital downloads), merchandise and bundles are made available for people in the US. People outside the US can order physical editions from Electric Fetus. In addition to Infinite on Electric Fetus, digital versions of The Madness Begins... and Absolute Power are also made available there.
As of February 2020, Powermad has been working on new material for their third album.

Powermad at AllMusic","Powermad is an American thrash/speed metal band formed in Minneapolis in 1984. The group has been called an ""innovative and often forgotten speed metal band...who infused progressive metal styles and European styles into abstract American speed metal."" The band's intricate riff formulations were heavily influenced by thrash metal acts like Metallica and Testament. Vocalist Joel DuBay's singing is easily recognizable with his mixture of singing and high screams.

Daviesia glossosema,"Daviesia glossosema, commonly known as maroon-flowered daviesia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae and is endemic to a restricted area of south-western Western Australia. It is an erect shrub with tangled, spreading branches, cylindrical, sharply-pointed phyllodes, and unusually-shaped maroon flowers.


== Description ==
Daviesia glossosema is an erect shrub that typically grows to a height of 0.5–1 m (1 ft 8 in – 3 ft 3 in) and has spreading, tangled branches with glaucous foliage. Its leaves are reduced to scattered, erect, needle-shaped, sharply-pointed phyllodes 8–40 mm (0.31–1.57 in) long and about 1 mm (0.039 in) wide. The flowers are arranged in racemes of two to five on a peduncle 4–7 mm (0.16–0.28 in) long, the rachis 1–3 mm (0.039–0.118 in) long, each flower on a pedicel 3–5 mm (0.12–0.20 in) long with bracts about 1 mm (0.039 in) long at the base. The sepals are about 4 mm (0.16 in) long and joined at the base with minute teeth. The petals are maroon, the standard egg-shaped, 10.0–10.5 mm (0.39–0.41 in) long and curved backwards, the wings about 11.5–13.5 mm (0.45–0.53 in) long and curved inwards exposing the keel and stamens, and the keel is about 8 mm (0.31 in) long. Flowering occurs from September to November and the fruit is an inflated triangular pod 14–20 mm (0.55–0.79 in) long.


== Taxonomy and naming ==
Daviesia glossosema was first formally described in 1995 by Michael Crisp in Australian Systematic Botany. The specific epithet (glossosema) is derived from words meaning ""tongue"" and ""standard"", referring to the unusual shape of that petal.


== Distribution and habitat ==
Maroon-flowered daviesia grows in heath in a small area of the Stirling Range in the south-west of Western Australia.


== Conservation status ==
Daviesia glossosema is listed as ""Threatened Flora (Declared Rare Flora — Extant)"" by the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions and an Interim Recovery Plan has been prepared.

Munduruku Indigenous Territory,"The Mundurucu Indigenous Territory (Portuguese: Terra Indígena Mundurucu) is an indigenous territory in the state of Pará, Brazil.
It is occupied by the Apiacá and Munduruku people.
A proposed dam on the Tapajós river is on hold since it would flood part of the territory, and the constitution does not allow projects that would force relocation of indigenous people.


== Location ==
The Mundurucu Indigenous Territory (TI) is divided between the municipalities of Itaituba and Jacareacanga, Para.
It has an area of 2,382,000 hectares (5,890,000 acres).
The territory adjoins the Sai Cinza Indigenous Territory to the north and the Kayabi Indigenous Territory to the south.
The Tapajós river and its tributary the Teles Pires define the north and west boundary of the territory.
To the east it adjoins the Crepori National Forest and the Rio Novo National Park.
The TI lies entirely in the Tapajós river basin, in the Amazon biome.
Vegetation includes dense rainforest (17.27%), open rainforest (24.28%), savanna-rainforest contact (37.51%), savanna-seasonal forest contact (14.60%), as well as small area of rainforest-seasonal forest contact, savanna-pioneer formation contact, seasonal deciduous forest and savanna.
The people of the territory define regions in terms of rivers.
The main ones are the Teles Pires River, Anipiri River, Tapajós River, Cururu River, Igarapé Wareri, Igarapé Parawadukti, Cadiriri River, Cabitutu River, das Tropas River, Kaburuá River, Igarapé Preto and Igarapé Maçaranduba.


== History ==
The Mundurucu Indigenous Territory  was officially recognized by decree of 26 February 2004.
The reservoir of the proposed Chacorão Dam on the Tapajós river would affect the Munduruku, Kayabí and Apiacá indigenous people.
It would flood 18,700 hectares (46,000 acres) of the Munduruku Indigenous Territory.
As of 2010 Eletronorte had not applied for registration with the National Electricity Agency to start feasibility studies for the Chacorão hydroelectric power plant.
A spokesman said that without change to the constitution there was no way to undertake projects in indigenous territories.


== Society ==
In 2002 it was estimated that there were 10,065 indigenous people in the Upper Tapajós Region, in about 80 villages.
However, villages are constantly being dissolved and reconstituted.
The largest numbers of Munduruku live in the Mundurucu Indigenous Territory, with most of the villages along the Cururu River, a tributary of the Tapajós.
The Munduruku Indigenous Territory is occupied mainly by Munduruku but also by people of the Apiacá, Kayabí, Kayapo, Tembé and Rikbaktsa ethnic groups.Estimated population of the territory was 2,420 in 1990, 5,075 in 1995 and had risen to 6,518 by 2012.
There are two indigenous organizations, the Associação Da'uk (AIP) and the Conselho Indígena Munduruku do Alto Tapajós (CIMAT).
The state is represented in the territory by the Fundação Nacional do Índio (Funai).
The Catholic Church operates the Missão de São Francisco.
The territory has a number of FUNASA bases, each with a small building with a waiting room, laboratory for testing for malaria, hospitalization room and staff accommodation.

Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria),"The Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgarian: Съюз на демократичните сили, romanized: Sayuz na demokratichnite sili, СДС / SDS) is a political party in Bulgaria, founded in 1989 as a union of several political organizations in opposition to the communist government. The Union was transformed into a single unified party with the same name. The SDS is a member of the European People's Party (EPP). In the 1990s the party had the largest membership in the country, with one million members, but has since splintered into a number of small parties totaling no more than 40,000 members. The SDS proper had 12,000 members in 2016.


== History ==
Dissident groups formed under the faltering regime of Todor Zhivkov in the late 1980s were the basis for the Union. Once Zhivkov fell, a loose political confederation was envisioned where constituent groups could continue to work for their own cause, while the coordinating council would include three members from each organization. The Longtime dissident philosopher Zhelyu Zhelev, who would later become Bulgaria's president, was elected chairman, and Petar Beron, a well-known environmental scientist, was chosen as secretary.
The SDS was officially founded on 7 December 1989 as a union of eleven political organizations, such as Ekoglasnost, Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers' Party (United) and Bulgarian Agrarian People's Union ""Nikola Petkov"". The following year, six more parties were incorporated (Radical Democratic Party, Green Party of Bulgaria, Democratic Party, New Social Democratic Party, United Democratic Centre, Democratic Front).The SDS lost the 1990 elections to the Bulgarian Socialist Party but still participated in the joint cabinet of Dimitar Iliev Popov. On 15 May 1991 39 members left the SDS because of disagreements with the draft of the new constitution and founded the new organizations SDS-Center and SDS-Liberals. Later the remnants of the SDS formed their own cabinet with Prime Minister Filip Dimitrov in November 1991, though the cabinet lasted only a little over a year when the government failed a motion of confidence in September 1992. The socialists, together with the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, formed a coalition government headed by Prof. Lyuben Berov. Following the resignation of Berov's cabinet in October 1994, the BSP went on to win the 1994 elections.
However, following discontent over economic problems, Prime Minister Zhan Videnov resigned at the end of 1996, clearing the way for new elections, this time won by the SDS with a crushing 55% vote. Party leader Ivan Kostov went on to form the new government and successfully passed several economic reforms. He was eventually rewarded in December 1999 with an invitation to begin membership talks with the European Union. But public discontent over the social cost of the reforms, including increased unemployment, as well as allegations of corruption led to the SDS's defeat in the June 2001 elections, which were won by the National Movement for Simeon II. The United Democratic Forces won 18.2% of the popular vote and 51 out of 240 seats.
The SDS was chaired until the May 20, 2007 European elections by Petar Stoyanov, former president of the country. Meanwhile, Kostov, the former Prime Minister and SDS party leader went on to form his own party - Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria. At the 2005 parliamentary election, the United Democratic Forces won 8.4% of the popular vote and 20 out of 240 seats.
It was announced at the inaugural conference of the Movement for European Reform (MER, March 2007) that the SDS would become official partners alongside the British Conservative Party and the Czech Civic Democratic Party. In mid April 2007, the SDS backtracked on its decision, stating that it remains loyal to the EPP and that it will never leave the EPP section of the EPP-ED Group to join another Group.
In the May 20, 2007 European elections the SDS failed to elect even a single MEP, resulting in the resignation of Stoyanov who led the list.
At the start of 2009 the SDS entered in an electoral alliance named the ""Blue Coalition"" with four other center-right parties: the DSB, the United Agrarians, the Bulgarian Social Democratic Party and the Radical Democratic Party. The alliance fielded candidates for the June 2009 European election winning a seat. When the Lisbon Treaty came into force in December of that year, their representation doubled. Now both the SDS and the DSB had an MEP.
The Blue coalition placed fifth in the legislative election a month later with a combined 6.8% of the vote and 15 seats.
In the May 2013 elections, the SDS ran alone and lost all of its seats in the Bulgarian National Assembly, but regained four next year as a part of the Reformist Bloc alliance. The same pattern repeated in 2017 and April of 2021, with zero and then two seats respectively (running together with GERB in 2021). Two other MPs joined the SDS later on.


== Coalitions ==


=== United Democratic Forces ===
For the 1997 parliamentary elections, an alliance named United Democratic Forces was formed around SDS. The same name was later used for other elections and parliamentary groups.


=== The Blue Coalition ===
In early 2009 an alliance was formed together with Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria for the European Parliament elections and National Assembly elections. The coalition was named the Blue Coalition and included some other parties.


=== The Reformist Bloc ===
The coalition agreement to form the alliance of the Reformist Bloc was signed on 20 December 2013. The five parties that signed the agreement were the Union of Democratic Forces, Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria, Bulgaria for Citizens Movement, People's Party Freedom and Dignity, and the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union.


=== GERB ===
Since 2019 the party is in a coalition with GERB.

2021 Pittsburgh mayoral election,"The 2021 Pittsburgh mayoral election took place on November 2, 2021. The primary election was held on May 18, 2021. The Democratic nominee, State Representative Ed Gainey, defeated the Republican nominee, retired police officer Tony Moreno.Incumbent Democratic Mayor Bill Peduto ran for re-election to a third term in office, but lost renomination to state representative Ed Gainey. Four Democrats and no Republicans filed to appear on their respective primary ballots. Tony Moreno, though having unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination, was the Republican nominee after having earned sufficient votes in the Republican primary as a write-in candidate to win the nomination. Two independent candidates had originally indicated an intention to file to appear on the general election ballot, though one withdrew and the other was removed from the ballot by judicial order. With 70,885 ballots cast, this was the highest turnout for a Pittsburgh mayoral race since 1997.


== Background ==
Bill Peduto was first elected in the 2013 election to succeed Luke Ravenstahl and assumed office in January 2014. Peduto sought and was re-elected to a second term in the 2017 election; in November 2017, Peduto garnered 96% of the vote, having not had any significant opposition in the general election.


== Democratic primary ==
The Democratic primary election was held on May 18, 2021. As of January 2021, four candidates had indicated an intention to seek the Democratic nomination. Retired Pittsburgh Police officer Tony Moreno announced his intention in September 2019, William Peduto announced his campaign for a third term in mid—January 2021, and State Representative Ed Gainey launched his campaign in late January 2021. Activist Will Parker launched his campaign in mid-December 2020. In March, four Democrats had filed paperwork to appear on the ballot, Peduto, Gainey, Moreno, and college math tutor and ride-sharing driver Michael Thompson. Parker did not file nominating papers.In mid-February 2021, Pittsburgh City Paper reported candidate Tony Moreno's Twitter included tweets praising Donald Trump, were supportive of Trump causes, and contained contempt for Democrats. After Pittsburgh City Paper's report was published Moreno's tweets were criticised by Pittsburgh's Democratic Committee chairman, many tweets were deleted from Moreno's Twitter, and his Twitter was switched to protected status.In early March 2021, the Allegheny County Democratic Committee announced that it had endorsed Gainey over the incumbent mayor Peduto, with 326 votes. Moreno received 224 votes. Peduto did not actively seek the endorsement of the committee, citing its endorsement of a Democratic candidate for the Pennsylvania House of Representatives who had made social media posts supportive of then-President Donald Trump. Peduto received the endorsements of some other Democratic leaders, including County Executive Rich Fitzgerald, U.S. Representative Mike Doyle, and State Senate minority leader Jay Costa.


=== Candidates ===


==== Nominee ====
Ed Gainey, Pennsylvania State Representative from the 24th District


==== Defeated in primary ====
Bill Peduto, incumbent Mayor of Pittsburgh
Tony Moreno, retired Pittsburgh Police officer

=== Endorsements ===


=== Results ===
Bill Peduto conceded the Democratic primary election to Ed Gainey on the night of the election.


== Republican primary ==
No Republican filed to run.


=== Results ===


=== Aftermath ===
Under Pennsylvania law, a candidate can win a party's nomination via write-in votes if they surpass 250 votes in said party's primary, even if they are not a member of that party. This means that Moreno and Peduto both qualified to appear on the November ballot as the Republican nominee. Peduto stated he had no intention of continuing his campaign and endorsed Ed Gainey. Moreno announced that he would accept the Republican nomination in late June and switched his party registration to Republican.

Life and Death in Shanghai,"Life and Death in Shanghai (上海生死劫) is an autobiographical memoir published in November 1987 by Chinese author Yao Nien-Yuan under the pen name Nien Cheng. Written while in exile in the United States, it tells the story of Cheng's arrest during the early days of the Cultural Revolution, her more than six years' of confinement, persecution, efforts to leave China, and life in exile.


== Background ==
Cheng was named ""an enemy of the state"" and arrested in late 1966 after the Red Guards looted her home. During her confinement, she was pressured to make a false confession that she was a spy for ""the imperialists"" because for many years after the death of her husband she had continued to work as a senior partner for Shell in Shanghai. Cheng refused and was thus tortured.She was eventually paroled under the pretense that her attitude had shown improvement. However, Cheng resisted leaving the detention house without receiving acknowledgment from her captors that she had been unjustly treated.
When released from jail in 1973, Cheng found that her daughter Meiping, who had been studying to become a film actress, had been murdered by the Red Guards, although the official position was that she had committed suicide. Cheng conducted a discreet investigation and found that this scenario was impossible. The alleged killer of Meiping, a rebel worker named Hu Yongnian, was arrested and given a suspended death sentence by Shanghai authorities in 1980, but was eventually paroled in 1995.
After being relocated from her spacious home to a mere two bedrooms on the second floor of a two-story building, Cheng continued her life under constant surveillance, including spying by the family living on the first floor.
She lived in China until 1980, when the political climate warmed enough for her to apply for a visa to the United States to visit family. She never returned, first emigrating to Canada, later to Washington, D.C., where she wrote the memoir.


== Summary ==
The memoir goes into great detail about Cheng's persecution, confinement, and torture, so much so that she said she had to put the manuscript away many times as she wrote it because the memories were so troubling.


== Reception ==
In a 1987 piece for the New York Times Books Review, J.M. Coetzee said the memoir provided ""fascinating insights into thought reform in Mao's China"" and that it tells ""an absorbing story of resourcefulness and courage, spoiled only by a touch of self-righteousness: Mrs. Cheng is always right, her persecutors always wrong.""In a 1987 New York Times review, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt wrote: ""Far from depressing, it is almost exhilarating to witness her mind do battle. Even in English, the keenness of her thought and expression is such that it constitutes some form of martial art, enabling her time and again to absorb the force of her interrogators’ logic and turn it to her own advantage.”In a 1987 review for The Washington Post, Stanley Karnow wrote: ""It is, on one level, a gripping, poignant chronicle of her courage, fortitude and, above all, stubborn integrity during more than six years of cold, hunger, disease, terror and humiliation in a Shanghai jail. At moments I could not continue reading, so vividly does she relate her agony. Yet, inevitably, I felt compelled to go back to its pages, riveted by her struggle to endure, which exalts the triumph of the human spirit over mindless inhumanity.""Elena Brunet of The Los Angeles Times wrote in a 1988 review: ""A harrowing story of personal suffering and tragedy, and at the same time a savage and compelling indictment of Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution, if not of Chinese communism itself.""Inspired by the memoir, Corey Hart dedicated an instrumental song to Cheng titled ""Ballade for Nien Cheng"" in his 1990 album Bang!.


== Awards ==
Life and Death in Shanghai won multiple awards, including New York Times Best Book of the Year (1987) and American Library Association's Outstanding Books for The College Bound (1996), among others.

Vermont Route 104,"Vermont Route 104 (VT 104) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Vermont. The highway runs 20.503 miles (32.996 km) from VT 15 in Cambridge to VT 105 in the town of St. Albans. VT 104 is an L-shaped route that connects the city of St. Albans and Cambridge via Fairfax. The highway has an auxiliary route, VT 104A, that connects Fairfax and Georgia to the west.


== Route description ==
VT 104 begins at an intersection with VT 15 in the town of Cambridge. The two-lane highway heads west parallel to the Lamoille River and crosses the Lamoille–Franklin county line into the town of Fairfax, where the highway is named Main Street. VT 104 crosses Beaver Creek and continues west between the south town line and the river to the north. South of the center of town, the highway curves north and meets the northern end of VT 128 (Browns River Road) at a tangent intersection. VT 104 passes through the town center between its bridges over the Lamoille River and Mill Brook; just south of the latter bridge, the route intersects Maple Street, which leads to the Maple Street Covered Bridge. The highway continues northwest and crosses Tracy Book and Swift Brook on either side of its junction with VT 104A (Highbridge Road), which leads west toward Interstate 89 (I-89) in Georgia.Near the northwest corner of Fairfax, VT 104 curves west and crosses the Mill River between the two St. Albans reservoirs. The highway passes under I-89 with no access then curves north to parallel the Interstate, during which the route briefly veers to the west of the town line into Georgia. After the short second stint through Fairfax, VT 104 briefly passes through the southwest corner of Fairfield before entering the town of St. Albans, where the highway is named Fairfax Road. The highway crosses Ruggs Brook and briefly becomes a divided highway around its intersection with St. Albans State Highway, a connector between U.S. Route 7 (US 7) in the south end of the city of St. Albans and a trumpet interchange with I-89 immediately to the east of VT 104. VT 104 continues north as Fisher Pond Road beyond its intersection with VT 36 (Fairfield Hill Road) and crosses Stevens Brook. The highway crosses over to the east side of I-89, crosses Hungerford Brook, and reaches its northern terminus at a T-intersection with VT 105 (Sheldon Road), which heads west toward the city of St. Albans and northeast toward Sheldon.


== Major intersections ==


== Auxiliary route ==
Vermont Route 104A (VT 104A) is a 4.527-mile-long (7.286 km) auxiliary route of VT 104 that runs from US 7 in Georgia east to VT 104 in Fairfax. The two-lane highway, which is named Highbridge Road in both towns, begins at US 7 (Ethan Allen Highway) south of the U.S. Highway's interchange with I-89 in Georgia. VT 104A bypasses a loop of Highbridge Road and crosses an arm of Arrowhead Mountain Lake, an impoundment of the Lamoille River. The highway follows the right bank of the river, passes the historic Kemp-Shepard House, and passes under the New England Central Railroad. VT 104A crosses Beaver Meadow Brook and veers away from the river as it enters the town of Fairfax. The highway crosses Swift Brook immediately before it reaches its eastern terminus at VT 104 (Main Street).

National Intelligence Coordination Centre,"The National Intelligence Coordination Centre is a branch of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police that deals with online threats. It was created in 2013 and deals with online crimes at home and abroad. It also monitors terrorist groups or protestors who might sabotage infrastructure.Information is gathered by RCMP officers, merged with information from other intelligence arms such as Canadian Security Intelligence Service or Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada. From this the NICC produces reports for the RCMP.It also produces reports for international partners in the Five Eyes intelligence alliance.


== Origins ==


=== October Crisis ===
Historically intelligence gathering had been done by the RCMP through their branch the RCMP Security Service. The October Crisis led to the RCMP collecting intelligence by stealing documents and planting dynamite on suspected radicals. Government investigations of this led to a new agency - the Canadian Security Intelligence Service being formed in 1984.


=== Maher Arar scandal ===
After the September 11 attacks the RCMP had a renewed interest in intelligence work. The Communications Security Establishment dealt with signals intelligence and the CSIS with Human intelligence. The RCMP had been frozen out of intelligence gathering and skills had atrophied.Maher Arar was arrested, rendered to Syria and tortured as the result of unfounded conclusions that had been shared with the FBI. A 2006 review found no evidence that he was linked to terrorist organisations and concluded the RCMP ""lacked the expertise to conduct national security investigations"".


== Director General arrested ==
In September 2019 the RCMP arrested Cameron Ortis, who was director general of the National Intelligence Coordination Centre, who had been running the NICC since 2016. He had joined the RCMP in 2007 from an academic background in technology and crime, after completing a PhD at the University of British Columbia before he joined. He was hired as a strategic analyst - a position described as a ""jack of all trades"". In November 2023, a jury found Ortis guilty of multiple counts under the Security of Information Act.

Namikawa Sōsuke,"Namikawa Sōsuke (1847–1910) was a Japanese cloisonné artist, known for innovations that developed cloisonné enamel into an artistic medium sharing many features with paintings. He and Namikawa Yasuyuki (no relation) were the most famous cloisonné artists of the 1890 to 1910 period, known as the ""golden age"" of Japanese enamels. Around 1880 he set up and ran the Tokyo branch of the Nagoya Cloisonné Company. He exhibited his artworks at national and international expositions, where he took an organising role. He was recognised as an Imperial Household Artist and created art works for imperial residences. He sometimes signed his works with the character sakigake (pioneer).


== Biography ==
Japanese cloisonné traditionally involved opaque blocks of enamel enclosed in brass wire cloisons. In the late 19th century, artists replaced brass with silver and developed enamels that were translucent or transparent. Namikawa's workshop is regarded as the foremost developer of these techniques. With repeated firings, wires were not necessary to stop enamel areas bleeding into each other. He used two new techniques taking advantage of this: in shosen the wires are mostly burned out by sulphuric acid, leaving just fine details whereas in musen the wires are removed entirely before the final firing. These techniques were created with help from Gottfried Wagener, brought from Germany as a technical consultant to Japanese industry, but Namikawa later took credit for their creation. He also claimed to have invented in 1879 his process for creating colour gradients.With these techniques, Namikawa's enamels could resemble paintings. He recreated nihonga paintings (of a classical Japanese style), particularly those of Watanabe Seitei. His subjects included hazy views of Mount Fuji and of clouds across the moon. A tray from around 1900 is likely modeled from a work by the Rinpa artist Ogata Kōrin. Over his career, Namikawa made increasing use of blank space, adopting a more distinctively Japanese style. The collector Donald Gerber distinguishes three schools of Japanese cloisonné and places Namikawa at the head of the Tokyo, or pictorial, school.


== Recognition ==
Namikawa exhibited at the 1881 National Industrial Exposition in Tokyo where his works were shown in the Art section while all other cloisonné works were displayed in the Industrial section. He won awards at the 1885 Amsterdam Colonial and Export Trade Exhibition, the 1885 Nuremberg International Metalwork Exhibition and the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1889. He also exhibited at the World's Columban Exposition of 1893 in Chicago. At the Louisiana Purchase Exposition of 1904 he won a Grand Prize. His work was also included in the Japan-British Exhibition held in London in 1910.An article on Japanese enamels in The Decorator and Furnisher of February 1893 commented:

Among Japanese enamellers Namikawa, of Tokyo, is pre-eminent. Indeed, in his own field, he has no world left to conquer. [...] [H]e has done all the enamelling throughout the royal palaces and wins always the highest art prizes at the fine arts exhibitions around the world.
In 1896 he was appointed an Imperial Household Artist, one of only two cloisonné artists ever to receive this award, along with Namikawa Yasuyuki. These artists were given a yearly stipend and were commissioned by the Imperial family to make presentation wares as gifts for foreign dignitaries. These would often bear the Imperial family crest, a sixteen-petaled chrysanthemum. He seems to have been especially popular with the Imperial family, receiving many commissions. In 1906–7 he made a series of thirty enamel plaques for the Akasaka Palace. These oval medallions bear designs by Watanabe Seitei depicting flowers and birds of the four seasons. His Imperial commissions also included a pair of vases that were presented to the British admiral Sir Nowell Salmon.Outside of Japan his works are in collections such as the Walters Art Museum and the Khalili Collection of Japanese Art of the Meiji Era.

South Carolina Highway 39,"South Carolina Highway 39 (SC 39) is a 100.889-mile (162.365 km) primary state highway in the U.S. state of South Carolina. The highway connects various rural communities and towns from the southwest to the northwest sections of the state.


== Route description ==
SC 39 is a two-lane rural highway that travels 100.7 miles (162.1 km) from the Savannah River Site to U.S. Route 221 (US 221) south of Laurens.


== History ==
Established in 1922 as an original state highway, traveling from SC 12, in Monetta, to SC 21, in Edgefield. In 1923, SC 39 was extended in both directions: west to SC 20, in Modoc, and southeast to SC 4, in Springfield.  By 1926, it was extended south again to SC 27, in Williston.  The first section of SC 39 to be paved was from Johnston to Edgefield, in 1930.
In 1936, SC 39 was rerouted at Ridge Spring north through Saluda and Cross Hill, before ending at US 221, south of Laurens; it replaced a majority of SC 392, while the old alignment became an extension of SC 23.  By 1938, SC 39 was extended in both directions again: north to Ware Shoals then west to US 178, in Shoals Junction; and southwest from Williston to SC 64, in Dunbarton.
In 1940, SC 39 was extended south to SC 28/SC 282 (today's SC 125, near Millett. By 1942, SC 39 reached its apex with an extension into Millett, giving it a length of over 145 miles (233 km). By 1946, all of SC 39 was paved, with its last section between SC 391 and US 1.
In 1948, SC 39 was truncated at SC 64, in Dunbarton, leaving behind existing Furse Mill Road (S-30-17) and Rolling Hills Road (S-30-24). The section of SC 39 between US 221 and Ware Shoals was downgraded to secondary roads: Indian Mound Road (S-30-6) and Power House Road (S-30-47); this also created a gap as SC 39 was still between Ware Shoals and Shoals Junction.  In 1951 or 1952, the discontinued length of SC 39 between Ware Shoals and Shoals Junction was renumbered as SC 420.  Also, during the same period, SC 39 was truncated to its current southern terminus at the Savannah River Site boundary near a realigned routing of SC 28 (today's US 278); a majority of its former route now within the Savannah River Site still exists, though sections have been removed or submerged under Par Pond.

Mining industry of Guinea-Bissau,"Mining in Guinea-Bissau is limited to small-scale production of construction materials, such as clays, granite, limestone, and sand and gravel. The country's prospective minerals include bauxite, diamond, gold, heavy minerals, petroleum, and phosphate rock.


== Phosphate ==
Phosphate deposits were identified about 40 years ago in the region of Farim. Feasibility studies  were completed in the 1980s, but since then no company has been able to begin exploitation. The Farim phosphate rock deposit had estimated resources of more than 166 Mt at a grade of 29% P4O10.Red Back Mining Inc. through its subsidiary Champion Industrial Minerals (CIM) held a mining lease and after completing a technical and market evaluation in 2003, the company concluded that the project had advanced to a stage where it required a level of developmental, operational, and marketing expertise that was beyond CIM's capacity; since that time, the company has attempted to either locate a suitable partner to develop the Farim deposit or to sell it. Over the past 10 years, licences changed hands between companies for reasons similar to those advanced by CIM, i.e. technical inability to perform required work. More recently, the licence has been held by GB Minerals which signed in 2009 a production agreement with the Guinea-Bissau government.


== Bauxite ==
Bauxite deposits have  been identified near the city of Boé since the 1950s. At the time they were never commercially viable due to low world prices. As the economic prospects have become more enticing in the past decaden a lease was granted to a firm named Bauxite Angola in 2007, which has recently made announcements of investments of up to US$500 million.

John Kim Bell,"John Kim Bell  (born October 8, 1952) is Canada’s first Indigenous symphony-orchestra conductor, the founder of the country’s precedent-setting National Aboriginal Achievement Foundation (today known as Indspire) and the National Aboriginal Achievement Awards (today known as the Indspire Awards) and one of Canada's leading energy resource consultants representing First Nations. Bell is a decorated Canadian and an internationally recognized leader and activist in the arts, philanthropy and First Nations resource development.
Bell is an Officer of the Order of Canada and a member of the Order of Ontario. He was the national recipient of the Royal Bank Award for Canadian Achievement in 1988, a major Canadian award carrying a cash price of $250,000 and has received three medals from the Queen, among other citations for his ground-breaking work. He was named the 2003 national outstanding cultural leader by the Canadian Conference of the Arts in 2003.  In 2005, he served as one of five Canadian advisors to Prince Charles and received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Royal Conservatory of Music in 2007. The Indigenous community has recognized Bell's contribution to the advancement of Indigenous peoples; he has been honoured with three Eagle feathers throughout his career.


== Family and education ==


=== Early life ===
John Kim Bell was born on the Kahnawake Reserve in Quebec, Canada in 1952. He is the eldest child of Don Eagle and Beth Hamilton, the former a Mohawk wrestler from Canada deemed ""the most famous Indian in the world."" In the late 1940s, Eagle became the AWA World Heavyweight Champion and, in the 1950s, he starred on The Tonight Show monthly. Bell’s mother, Beth Hamilton Bell, was a model and writer who ran a radio program in the United States. Hoping to meet Don Eagle, she arranged an interview with him; six weeks later, the pair eloped.
Beth Hamilton Bell moved to the Kahnawake Mohawk Reserve to be with Eagle during an era when inter-racial marriage was illegal. After the birth of Bell and his brother, the marriage dissolved and Hamilton Bell took John Kim and his brother to the United States where they lived with Hamilton Bell’s parents in Columbus, Ohio. Bell and his brother returned to the Kahnawake Reserve in the summers of their youth but faced equal alienation there as they did in Columbus.
Bell began playing the piano at age eight and later studied violin and saxophone. Talented from an early age, he was playing the piano on local television talent shows at age ten and winning state piano competitions. As a teen he was hired by John Kenley to play piano for the Kenley Players summer theatre company which led to his appointment as associate conductor of the international company A Chorus Line. By the age of 18 Bell was conducting numerous Broadway, ballet and operatic productions, which included headliners Gene Kelly and Lauren Bacall.


=== Education and early career ===
Bell attended Ohio State University from which he received a Bachelor of Music in 1976. He went on to attend the Academia Musica Chigiana in Sienna, Italy and later apprenticed with Zubin Mehta at the New York Philharmonic. After studying in Italy, Bell went to New York and conducted for the Harlem Dance Theatre, Eglevsky Ballet, and many Broadway shows and operatic productions.


== Career ==


=== Composer and conductor ===
In 1980, Bell was touring in Toronto, Ontario, Canada with the international company of A Chorus Line. The pit musicians, predominantly from the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, were so taken with Bell that they suggested to then-Music Director of the TSO Andrew Davis to take Bell on as an apprentice. Shortly after auditioning for Davis, Bell was appointed Apprentice Conductor of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra.In 1984, the CBC created a documentary on Bell’s musical career titled ""John Kim Bell: The First North American Indian Conductor."" The release of this documentary caused innumerable Indigenous artists to contact him for support in achieving success. Bell also began to receive speaking invitations from Indigenous communities and political groups as well as solicitations for charitable donations. Having researched and not found any existing Indigenous arts programs, Bell was inspired to establish the Canadian Native Arts Foundation (CNAF) to educate and promote Indigenous artists. His first concert fundraiser took place in 1987 and included the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, Don Ross, the then-unknown Shania Twain, and Bernadette Peters.John Kim Bell produced, directed, co-composed, and conducted In the Land of the Spirits, the first all-Indigenous ballet to tour nationally. The ballet premiered at the National Arts Centre in 1992 and enjoyed an immensely successful run.Bell composed music for Divided Loyalties, The Trial of Standing Bear, No Turning Back, and Time Immemorial, as well as for many of the National Aboriginal Achievement Awards shows that he executive produced and directed. In 1985 he conducted the orchestra of the National Ballet of Canada and in 1987, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in London.


=== Philanthropist ===
As an Indigenous man living in the bourgeois world of symphony music, Bell experienced a sort of identity crisis. He recognized that as a powerful Indigenous role model, he could contribute to - and inspire- substantial social change for his peoples.In 1985, Bell founded the National Aboriginal Achievement Foundation. In 1993, to mark the United Nations’ International Decade of the World’s Indigenous People, Bell mounted the National Aboriginal Achievement Awards, celebrating the success of Indigenous leaders in Canada. Under Bell's leadership the National Aboriginal Achievement Awards were once the largest cultural event in Canada. Bell served as the President for the NAAF for twenty years, aiding it to become the largest charity for Indigenous peoples. He has been credited with accruing the greatest amount of corporate support for an Indigenous cause within Canada. Over two decades, Bell raised approximately $80 million for the NAAA and NAAF. The NAAF is now known as Indspire, while the NAAA has been renamed to the Indspire Awards.In 2008, Bell proposed the idea of a $250 million First Nations Loan Guarantee Program in Ontario, which the provincial government implemented in 2010.Bell is a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.


=== Consultancy ===
From 1988 to 2005 Bell was president of management company Ariontha Inc. In 2006 he founded Bell & Bernard Limited. In 2009 he helped established the Enbridge School Plus Program, which supports extracurricular activities and enrichment programming in First Nations schools. Today, Mr. Bell is one of Canada's leading Indigenous energy resource consultants representing First Nations and the President & CEO of Bell & Bernard Limited.


== Board appointments ==
Bell has been a member of several boards including at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation, and the Aboriginal Human Resource Development Council of Canada. He has also sat on the boards of the Canadian Institute for Health Research, the Federal Task Force on Professional Training in the Cultural Sector, and the City of Toronto's 2008 Olympic bid.

John Crozier (politician),"John Crozier (12 August 1814 – 21 April 1887) was a pastoralist of New South Wales and Victoria and a South Australian politician.


== History ==
Crozier was born in Roxburgh, Scotland, and in 1838 emigrated in the Coromandel to New South Wales, where he had been appointed to manage the estate of Redesdale, in the Braidwood district, owned by Dr. Anderson, of Parramatta, and which was principally worked by assigned convicts. For three years he managed the Redesdale property, then from 1841 he managed the Sandhills station, not far from Bungendore and Lake George, in the Bathurst district for Captain Dobson, R.N. While there, he worked closely with John Henry Challis (died 29 February 1880), a member of the firm of Flower, Salting, & Co., who managed Captain Dobson's commercial interests in Sydney, and who bequeathed £100,000 to the Sydney University.
After five years at the Sandhills, he took up a station on the Edward River with partner George Rutherford; then moved to the Wentworth district, where they established Kulnine station. After some years of this pioneering work, Crozier became the sole proprietor of Kulnine, and eventually prospered sufficiently to acquire Moorna and other stations on the opposite side of the Murray. Eventually he sold Kulnine station and half the stock to Mr. Bagot, and as years went on he purchased runs in the north and on the Queensland and New South Wales borders, placing his sons in charge of these properties. In 1866 he moved to Adelaide, and in August that year purchased Oaklands estate, near Brighton, from Samuel R. Kearne (c. 1829–1921) and John H. Kearne (1830–1890), whose father Samuel Kearne (c. 1892–1857) had established the farm and 24-room residence. The estate included land which became the modern suburbs of Oaklands Park and Warradale.
In 1867 Crozier stood for a seat in the Legislative Council, which at that time was elected by the colony treated as one large constituency ""The Province"", one third falling vacant every four years. Three seats had become vacant through death or resignation, and Crozier was returned at the head of the poll, with (later Sir) William Morgan and Emanuel Solomon the other successful candidates. In 1877 six elected members were returned: William Morgan, John Crozier, Richard Chaffey Baker, Thomas English, James Pearce and Henry Kent Hughes. For the 1885 election the colony was divided into four districts for the Legislative Council, and Crozier and Henry Scott were returned for the Central district; Crozier died two years later.He was also for many years chairman of the Brighton District Council, and took a considerable interest in the wine industry, and produced a large quantity while he was at Oaklands. He also took an interest in horse breeding, and imported some high-priced animals from Tasmania. He was in 1875 a founding steward of today's South Australian Jockey Club, along with Sir John Morphett, Sir Henry Ayers and others.


== Family ==
He married Jessie Taylor (1819 – 3 January 1877). Their children included:

William Crozier (1839 – 22 June 1906) purchased Moorna station and Tilcha stations, and Kulnine from his brother John. He inherited the Oaklands estate from his father. He married Esther Murray (1848– ), a sister of sheep breeders Alick and John J. Murray. He was judged to be a lunatic by the South Australian Equity Court, and placed in confinement. His valuable estates were entrusted to the management of James Angus Johnston.
John Crozier, jr. (1843 – 6 July 1916) was a noted racehorse breeder. He inherited Kulnine station from his father and sold it to his brother William. He then purchased St. Albans Stud from James Wilson, sen. and sold that establishment a few years later to mining magnate W. R. Wilson (no relation) at a substantial profit.
Elizabeth Lilian Crozier (1845 – April 1936) married John Richardson (c. 1846 – 10 September 1917) on 7 December 1866. She moved to Perugia, Italy with her daughters, Mrs. Percy Frost and Mrs. T. F. Wigley. She died in London.
Walter Taylor ""Wattie"" Crozier (c. 1848 – 6 June 1931) married Elizabeth Ann Hancock; owned a third share of Bimbowrie station with brothers Arthur and Edwin. He appears to have lived and died unheralded. His wife made claims on her father-in-law's estate together with Elizabeth Richardson; perhaps indicating she and Walter were separated.
Thomas (1850 – c. 25 August 1878) died of heart attack at Cuthero on the River Darling
Elliot Crozier (1852? 1854? – 10 November 1941) lived at ""Kongal"", Bordertown, married ""Lottie"" Trew (1868 – 28 April 1938) on 7 December 1887. Their eldest daughter, Jessie Martyn Crozier (died 18 August 1931) married Hurtle Augustus Pegler. Another daughter, Cowra Crozier, married Ben Chaffey.
Arthur Crozier (1856 – 13 September 1929), pastoralist, inherited Kulnine station from his father and purchased Moorara and Cuthero stations from his brother-in-law Ben Chaffey. He married Annie (c. 1867 – 20 July 1938); their children included Gordon, Lindsay, Keith, Kenneth, Malcolm, Neil, Marjorie (Mrs Ron Cameron) and Jean.
Edwin Crozier (c. 1859 – 21 November 1906) was born at Kulnine and educated at Frederick Caterer's Glenelg Grammar School. He married Ethel Trew on 21 February 1898. His father gave him, with brothers Arthur and Walter, Bimbowrie station, which was where he died in agony after accidentally setting fire to his clothing.
George Taylor Crozier (1861 – 27 August 1929) was a noted horseman, sheep breeder and sporting shooter. He married Amie Maud  Southee of Balranald and died at Kirkee Private Hospital in Mildura.

Sebastian Lane,"Sebastian Lane (born October 1992, Chicago, Illinois, United States) is an American rock and roll / blues / Southern rock singer-songwriter, guitarist and Medical Doctor.


== Early life ==
Sebastian Lane was born to his father, the American blues artist, Jimmy D. Lane and French mother, Isabelle. He is the grandson of Blues Hall of Fame inductee Jimmy Rogers, who gained prominence as the guitarist for the Muddy Waters Band.
Lane began playing guitar at age three. Growing up, he found influence and drew inspiration from his father and grandfather, as well as musicians such as Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Doyle Bramhall II, The Rolling Stones, Gary Clark Jr and Freddie King. Lane never took guitar lessons. He learned by ear, teaching himself by listening to various songs repetitively.
After the passing of his grandfather in 1997, the Lane family left Chicago, Illinois and moved to Salina, Kansas, where Sebastian's father was hired by Chad Kassem to work at Blue Heaven Studios and APO Records. Blue Heaven Studios and Kassem hosted a yearly festival known as ""Blues Masters at the Crossroads"". This festival was geared towards bringing in blues musicians from the south and around the country who did not have much longer to live and share their art. Surrounded by this atmosphere further attracted Lane to blues culture and inevitably led him to pursue a similar path.
Since childhood, Lane has split his interests between music and following his passions for science and medicine. His interest in medicine arose after the passing of his grandfather, secondary to colon cancer. His family moved several more times before settling in Vancouver, Canada after his father remarried. Lane attended four high schools before graduating from Sullivan Heights Secondary School in the spring of 2011.
He enrolled at Hastings College, where he graduated with his Bachelor's degree in biology. He was then accepted at University of Nebraska Medical Center for medical school
He released his debut album Walkin' By Myself in July 2018 while on a rotation in Pediatrics at Children's Hospital of Omaha.


== Career ==
Lane has worked for other artists as a studio guitarist and ghost writer.


=== Sebastian Lane Band ===
In 2018 he decided to focus on his own music and developed the Sebastian Lane Band. This group is a modern age rock band with influences from Lane's blues heritage. The group features Lane on vocals and lead guitar, Ben Curran on guitar, Dain Armbrust on bass guitar, Kevin Fries on drums and Mitch Towne on keyboards. Occasionally, Grace Calderon, joins the ensemble. Several of these musicians started with the Omaha Blues Society and their program called Blues Ed. Curran was accepted into Berklee College of Music.
Lane released his debut album, Walkin' By Myself in July 2018. The album featured Eric Gales on the song ""Jezebel"" and Christone ""Kingfish"" Ingram on a cover of blues standard ""Catfish Blues"". The album, and their growing support in the midwest landed them opening spots with Jimmie Vaughan, Robert Randolph, Marcus King Band, Eric Gales, Joanne Shaw Taylor, Indigenous, Anthony Gomes, Albert Castiglia and others.
Lane was nominated as both ""Artist of the Year"" and ""Best Blues Artist"" in the Omaha Entertainment and Arts Awards. Their album accumulated over a quarter million streams on Apple Music and Spotify across over 30 different countries.

Golden Snowball Award,"The Golden Snowball Award is an annual award presented to the city in Upstate New York that receives the most snowfall in a season. The original award was the result of a friendly competition of National Weather Service offices in Upstate. It was originally conceived after the Great Lakes Blizzard of 1977. After the Rochester and Syracuse offices closed in the mid-1990s, the competition died out.
The award was revived during the 2002–2003 snowfall season when Patrick DeCoursey started up a website to inform people of this fun snow contest from the past.  This was the start of the revival of the snow contest that dated back to the late '70s.  Syracuse won that season and they had won every year from then through the 2010–2011 season as well. In the 2011–2012 season, Rochester was the first city other than Syracuse to win since the award's revival. They also receive temporary possession of a trophy for the year. The original competition's trophy went missing, prompting its replacement with a new one donated by a trophy shop in Syracuse. The current Golden Snowball trophy resides at Buffalo State University.
Compared to Syracuse's average snowfall of 127.8 inches, or over 10 feet per year, New York City's annual snow average is a relatively small 2–3 feet per year in the city and about 3–4 feet per year in nearby suburbs. This is due to a number of factors, including lower latitude and oceanic influence keeping much of the precipitation as rain in the winter, combined with distance from the Great Lakes keeping the city well away from the influence of lake-effect snow.  For the first time ever, during the 2005–2006 winter season New York City did have more snowfall than Albany, mainly due to the Blizzard of 2006, which was the city's biggest snowfall to date, while Albany was on the extreme northern fringe.
The cities that compete for the award are:

Albany
Binghamton
Buffalo
Rochester
SyracuseUntil the 2006–2007 season, several smaller cities also competed for a smaller award, that includes a $50 check. These are:

Fulton

Brattvær Church,"Brattvær Church (Norwegian: Brattvær kirke) is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Smøla Municipality in Møre og Romsdal county, Norway.  It is located in the tiny hamlet of Brattvær, just south of the larger village of Råket on the western coast of the island of Smøla.  It is the church for the Brattvær parish which is part of the Ytre Nordmøre prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Møre. The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1917 by the architect Jakob Parelius Holmgren. The church seats about 420 people.


== History ==
The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to 1589, but the church was not new that year. It may have been built in the 1400s. The church originally stood on the highest hill on the small island of Brattværet, one of the larger islands about 3.5 kilometres (2.2 mi) northwest of the main island of Smøla. In 1661, the church was described as a stave church without a tower or spire. The church did not have a very good churchyard in which coffins could be buried due to the rocky land. In the early 1700s, the church blew down in a large storm. Soon after, in 1709, a chapel was erected on the site. This chapel building was standing until 1888.In the 1880s, it was decided to replace the old Brattvær Church, but to build it on the main island of Smøla. The new church was built in 1885 at Skarpeneset on the west coast of Smøla. The church was designed by Henrik Nissen and Holm Munthe. After lightning strikes on 20 November 1913, the church burned down to the ground and all the historic furniture inside was lost. Work on planning a new church on the same site started immediately. The new wooden long church building was designed by Jakob Holmgren and the lead builder was O. Hamnes. The church was consecrated on 26 September 1917. In 1954, electricity was installed in the building for the first time. In the late-1970s bathrooms were installed in the building. A renovation of the building was completed in 2007 after damage from a lightning strike. The church received new white exterior paint, a new electrical system, and a newly rebuilt roof.

Labadee,"Labadee (French: Labadie) is a port located on the northern coast of Haiti within the arrondissement of Cap-Haïtien in the Nord department. It is a private resort leased to Royal Caribbean Group, for the exclusive use of passengers of its three cruise lines: Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, and Azamara Club Cruises, until 2050. Royal Caribbean has contributed the largest proportion of tourist revenue to Haiti since 1986, employing 300 locals, allowing another 200 to sell their wares on the premises for a fee  and paying the Haitian government US$12 per tourist. 
The resort is completely tourist-oriented, and is guarded by a private security force. The site is fenced off from the surrounding area, and passengers are not allowed to leave the property. Food available to tourists is brought from the cruise ships. A controlled group of Haitian merchants are given sole rights to sell their merchandise and establish their businesses in the resort. Although sometimes described as an island in advertisements, it is actually a peninsula contiguous with the island of Hispaniola. The cruise ship moors to the pier at Labadee capable of servicing the Oasis class ships, which was completed in late 2009. The commercial airport that is closest to Labadee is Cap-Haïtien International Airport.
Attractions include a Haitian flea market, beaches, watersports, a water-oriented playground, an alpine coaster, and the largest zip-line over water.


== Etymology ==
The location is named after the Marquis de La Badie, a Frenchman who first settled the area in the 17th century. The peninsula and a village were named Labadie. The cruise company spells the name ""Labadee"" to make it easier for American English-speakers to pronounce.


== History ==
In the 1990s it was variously reported that many cruise ship guests who disembarked at the location were apparently unaware that they were in Haiti - at least in part due to the fact that the cruise company seemed to have a policy of referring only to Hispaniola, not that they were in Haiti.In November 2001, a crew member from the cruise line Royal Caribbean was attacked on Labadee in an apparent robbery. The assailants were arrested by Haitian police.
In February 2004, during the 2004 Haitian coup d'état, Royal Caribbean temporarily suspended use of the stop due to the political unrest in the country.In 2009, Royal Caribbean made US$55 million improvements to the facilities, including upgrading port facilities to allow docking of their largest cruise ships.In January 2010, just after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Royal Caribbean announced its intention to continue cruise stopovers at the port and use cruise ships to ferry relief supplies and personnel. In addition, it would donate US$1 million to fund relief efforts in Haiti.In January 2016, Haitians in boats protesting against the Haitian government blocked the port. Royal Caribbean's Freedom of the Seas cancelled their port stop on January 19 as a result.

This margin was less than the 1 percent threshold needed to avoid a mandatory recount.  The recount, which occurred on December 14, resulted in Norwood gaining five votes and Bottoms losing six in Fulton County, while the vote totals in DeKalb County remained the same.  The election was re-certified on December 17 after Fulton County accepted the new results.

However, it was announced on 17 July 2023 that Giles would be leaving the show once again later in the year with her final scenes airing on 14 November 2023.


== Storylines ==


=== 1998–2004 ===
Bernice arrives in the village and finds work as a barmaid at the Woolpack. Initially, she does not like Tricia Stokes (Sheree Murphy), but after they discover their partners – Gavin Ferris (Robert Beck) and Jason Kirk (James Carlton) – are having an affair, they become good friends. In April 1999, it is revealed that Bernice, originally from down south, came to Leeds by closing her eyes and pointing at a map. The reason - she left her husband Anthony after finding him in bed with another man. Bernice calls off her engagement to Gavin, who was unfaithful with her friend, Stella Jones (Stephanie Schonfield). She then becomes the landlady of The Woolpack thanks to a bequest from the guilt-ridden Stella. Bernice begins a relationship with the local vicar, Ashley. After getting Bishop George's (Peter Cartwright) blessing, they marry on Christmas Day. Bernice is given away by her mother, Diane, even though her father, Rodney (Patrick Mower), is in attendance.
Bernice falls pregnant but miscarries. In her grief, she lashes out at Ashley and he takes a temporary job away from the village as he feels unable to help her. Bernice, however, feels abandoned and begins an affair with Carlos but this is complicated when Bernice discovers she is pregnant again but doesn't know who the father is. Bernice's half-sister, Nicola, arrives in the village and begins dating Carlos. She is clearly keener on him than he is on her but they later announce that they are getting married and expecting a baby but on her hen night, Nicola admits that she is not pregnant but felt it was the only way to get Carlos to settle down with her. Bernice makes Nicola tell Carlos the truth and in revenge for Nicola's lies, Carlos tells her that he and Bernice are together and he could be the father of her baby. Nicola promptly tells the village about this, devastating Ashley, and he asks her to move out. Bernice, feeling guilty for hurting Ashley, tries to make amends but Ashley is not interested and during another argument, they realise Bernice is in labour, so he takes her to hospital where she has a daughter who she names Gabby (Annelise Manojlovic). Bernice hopes Carlos is Gabby's father but a paternity test reveals she is Ashley's child, leading Ashley and Bernice to reconcile. However, Bernice's doubts about her marriage, in addition to her postnatal depression, cause more problems between the couple. After Gabby's christening, Bernice tells Ashley that she does not love him any more. Finding living in Emmerdale too difficult, Bernice takes a job on a cruiseliner, leaving Gabby with Ashley and the couple get divorced off-screen.
Bernice returns in 2004 to attend Tricia's funeral. Now living in Brighton, she tells her father that she wants Gabby to live with her but when she goes to discuss the idea with Ashley, she sees how close he and Gabby are and realises that it would be unfair to take Gabby away. Bernice returns to Brighton, leaving Ashley and Diane unaware of her intentions. Bernice gets engaged to her partner, Charlie. They get married and she gives birth to another daughter who she names Diane, after her mother.


=== 2012–2019 ===
Bernice returns to the village to see Diane and admits that her marriage to husband Charlie is over. Her ex-husband Ashley asks Bernice what her intentions are towards their daughter Gabby and she states that she wants to spend more time with her. Ashley and his wife Laurel Thomas (Charlotte Bellamy) tell Bernice that they need to set some ground rules, particularly when Bernice asks Laurel to take a back seat, much to Ashley and Laurel's anger as Laurel has played a much bigger part in Gabby's upbringing than Bernice. Diane and Rodney later learn that Bernice has been having an affair. They confront her and Bernice reveals that she is in love with a man named Steve and she is waiting for him to leave his wife. Bernice's half-sister Nicola takes matters into her own hands and informs Steve's wife about her husband's relationship with Bernice and she throws him out, so he joins Bernice in the village. The only thing that Bernice is now unhappy about is that Charlie is awkward about allowing her access to their daughter so she goes to visit him, hoping to persuade him to be more reasonable. Bernice becomes Acting landlady of The Woolpack working alongside Chas Dingle (Lucy Pargeter) while Diane is away in Brighton. Diane returns weeks later to inform everyone that she is moving to Australia and is selling her share of The Woolpack. Bernice has high hopes of buying Diane's share and becoming landlady again as does Chas. Diane eventually reveals that she has decided to stay and takes The Woolpack off the market dashing Bernice's dreams of owning the pub again.
In October 2013, Bernice, along with many other villagers including Diane and Nicola, are held hostage in the Woolpack by Cameron Murray (Dominic Power). He orders for Bernice to give him the pub's keys, and if she threatens him in any way, he will shoot and kill Diane with a gun he has stolen. Bernice, Diane, Nicola and the others are all eventually released by Cameron, but he keeps Chas and Debbie Dingle (Charley Webb) hostage. In 2014, Bernice is stunned to hear that Diane has slept with Eric Pollard (Chris Chittell), the husband of Diane's sister, Val (Charlie Hardwick), but sticks up for her mother. Bernice then enters internet dating and meets a man named Anton Bluth (Andrew Dowbiggin). She tells him that her name is ""Beverley"", and they arrange to meet up at Nicola and her husband Jimmy's (Nick Miles) house. Bernice believes that she and Anton are going to have sex, but when they get to the bedroom, Anton handcuffs her to the bed and steals most of Jimmy and Nicola's belongings. Bernice is humiliated and ashamed and she vows to get revenge on Anton. She gets Nicola involved, forcing her to pretend to be a woman named ""Bernice"", who has fallen in love with Anton. When Anton begins pestering her, Nicola panics and hides in the toilets, where she calls Bernice. When Bernice arrives, Anton is nowhere to be seen. She then kicks one of the toilet cubical doors, and knocks Anton unconscious, leaving him with a nose-bleed. Bernice then strips him off and ties him to the toilet, and takes photos of him on his mobile phone. She then blackmails him into getting Jimmy and Nicola's belongings back.
In March 2014, she begins to plan opening a salon in the area. Despite the fact that most people seem relatively uninterested, Bernice holds a brainstorming session with Val, Alicia Gallagher (Natalie Anderson), David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden) amongst others. However, it is ruined when Val reveals to Alicia that her son Jacob (Joe-Warren Plant) has been stealing items from her and David's shop to sell at school. Kerry Wyatt (Laura Norton) begs Bernice to let her work in the salon, as she is a beautician and hairdresser without qualifications. She gives Pearl Ladderbanks (Meg Johnson) and Betty Eagleton (Paula Tilbrook) a makeover to try to prove herself. Declan Macey (Jason Merrells) lets Bernice rent Pear Tree Cottage, even though her brother-in-law Jimmy works there already. Andy Sugden (Kelvin Fletcher) agrees to help her set up the salon and she gives him a free massage to thank him, but he is embarrassed and leaves when his ex-girlfriend Kerry arrives. He then agrees to help her again and she makes a pass at him and the pair end up kissing and having sex. They begin a relationship in secret, although it is soon rumbled when they are caught in the salon by Nicola, Rodney and Kerry. When Andy is involved in a severe farming accident, Bernice tries her best to help him, but later reveals in a conversation with Chas that she finds herself irritating Andy. She is later horrified when she spots Andy and his ex-wife Katie (Sammy Winward) kissing in the street. After drinking a bottle of wine, Bernice storms over to Katie and slaps her publicly, before descending into a catfight. As Chas and Finn Barton (Joe Gill) try and stop the fight, Katie slaps Bernice to try and stop her from attacking her. Bernice then grabs Finn's sausages and hits Katie with them and when Andy arrives, she does the same to him. Bernice then humiliates Katie in front of Leyla Harding (Roxy Shahidi) before leaving the village for Australia.
Bernice returns to the village a few weeks later and is determined to win Andy back. She is unaware, however, that Andy and Katie are now an item. When Bernice learns of this, she throws spaghetti carbonara over Katie before storming off. While confiding in Nicola, one of Bernice's clients from the salon informs her that she would be perfect for a modelling job, which she delightedly accepts. When Bernice arrives at the shoot, however, she is stunned to learn that she has to be naked for the job, as she thought she would be modelling clothes. When she arrives home, she tells Nicola that she turned the job down. Following the death of Katie, Bernice helps Andy through his grief, but she is stunned when Andy attempts to kiss her. After he attempts to force himself on her, she slaps him, promptly making him leave. Later, after Nicola leaves for Dubai, Bernice helps out Jimmy. She later becomes fed up of watching after him and demands he hire a maid, only for him to give the job to Tracy Shankley (Amy Walsh). Bernice is not impressed as she deliberately winds her up. She is later convinced that Tracy is stealing her belongings, leading to Bernice and Tracy having a catfight in front of Diane. Gabby eventually admits that she has been doing the deeds.
Bernice falls in love with Lawrence White (John Bowe) and they quickly become engaged, despite Lawrence being unable to perform sexually. Unsure that Lawrence will be able to satisfy her completely in the absence of a sexual relationship, Bernice has a one-night stand with Andy during her hen night. Prepared to leave Lawrence for Andy, Bernice is disappointed when Andy says it was a mistake and that he cannot commit to a relationship with her as he is still grieving for Katie. The next day — the day of the wedding — Bernice decides to come clean to Lawrence, although his daughter Chrissie White (Louise Marwood) has already told him after witnessing Bernice and Andy together. To her surprise, Lawrence does not seem worried and offers Bernice the chance to have an open marriage if she feels a sexless marriage will not satisfy her. Bernice is surprised by this and they decides to call the wedding off. Whilst Lawrence prepares to tell the already concerned guests about the wedding being called off, Bernice arrives, much to the surprise and delight of Lawrence, as she decides that she still loved him. Unbeknownst to Bernice, Andy had meanwhile had a change of mind and decided to tell Bernice he cared for her and wanted to give their relationship a try. Seeing Bernice walking down the aisle from a distance, Andy feels it is too late and leaves without saying anything. The ceremony carries on as planned and Bernice marries Lawrence.
Bernice's marriage to Lawrence puts her at odds with Chrissie and her son Lachlan White (Thomas Atkinson). Bernice lies and tells Nicola and Andy that she and Lawrence finally slept together when, in reality, he could not perform. When Bernice discovers that Lawrence's old friend Ronnie Hale (John McArdle) is gay and remembering a letter that she had seen months prior that was assumed to be written to Lawrence's late wife Ellen, she realises that it was actually to Lawrence and that he and Ronnie were lovers. Bernice confronts him and he again denies being gay. She tells him to go on a plane to Dubai, for their surprise second honeymoon, alone and states that he never should have asked her to marry him. After going on a holiday to clear her head, she returns and moves in with Diane and her partner and Douglas Potts (Duncan Preston) at their house Brook Cottage. But after she returns Lawrence becomes bitter towards everyone and everything including throwing Andy, Chrissie and Lachlan out of Home Farm and evicting, ""Beauty & Bernice"", from its premises at Pear Tree Cottage however, after the shooting, he returns the salon to Bernice. Before the shooting, Bernice begins sleeping with Andy again, despite him now being in a serious relationship with Chrissie. She discovers Andy's betrayal and after Lachlan shoots Lawrence, Chrissie frames Andy for the crime. Andy escapes custody during his trial and returns to Emmerdale, where Chrissie frames him for trying to kill her with a knife, however he meets with Bernice and he asks her to run away with him. She tells him that she cannot but they agree to wait for one another and Andy flees the country. After this, Bernice teams up with Andy's adoptive brother Robert Sugden (Ryan Hawley) to get revenge on Chrissie.

=== Relationship with Ashley Thomas ===
Bernice begins a relationship with the local vicar, Ashley Thomas (John Middleton). Ashley falls in love with Bernice but does not have the courage to tell her. He finds himself in a ""right state"" when he shares a tent with Bernice during a camping trip. As Middleton told Claire Brand from Inside Soap, Ashley could not handle scenarios involving females and now ""he has to spend time with this woman who he clearly adores"". While Ashley worries about the arrangement, Bernice remains ""ignorant"" to his feelings. The actor thought that Bernice had never contemplated a relationship with Ashley. He added that even ""Ashley doesn't think Bernice would give him a second look even if he did tell her how he feels."" The storyline had gained momentum off-screen as viewers had written to Middleton demanding a relationship between the two characters. While Inside Soap ran a poll which determined that readers wanted Bernice to leave Gavin Ferris (Robert Beck) in favour of Ashley. When the bishop learns of their romance he offers Ashley a job in Leeds, but Bernice does not like the idea. Giles told a writer from Inside Soap that her character is reluctant to leave the village because ""for once in her life, she has got some stability and she doesn't want to change that."" Ashley tries to persuade Bernice to move by taking her to visit his potential work place; but Bernice is not impressed. Giles explained that Bernice dislikes it and she feels depressed. While she accepts Ashley's beliefs, his relationship with the God creates problems during decision making. The actress added that Bernice ""naively thought that if they got engaged – their problems would be solved.""


=== Affair with Carlos Diaz ===
Bernice later has an affair with Carlos Diaz (Gary Turner). Carlos is engaged to Bernice's half-sister Nicola Blackstock (Nicola Wheeler). However, when Bernice's mother Diane Blackstock (Elizabeth Estensen) discovers their affair, she forces them to end it. Turner told a reporter from Inside Soap that Bernice and Carlos have tried to end their affair, but they have ""fallen madly, passionately in love"". The twosome know that ""they need"" to be together but cannot be truthful due to the fear of hurting their partners. Diane is initially ""instrumental"" in stopping the affair, but she soon realises they are seeing one another again. Turner explained that Diane wants Bernice and Carlos to see how much hurt their actions will cause. Carlos wants to make Diane realise that his and Bernice's feelings are ""more than just a petty affair"". Carlos attempts to tell Nicola the truth, but cannot, so he ends his affair with Bernice. Turner said that Bernice cannot believe it and ""begs him to reconsider""; as he will not a ""devastated"" Bernice fires Carlos from The Woolpack. The actor concluded that Carlos should not be deterred by Bernice's actions – ""if they try and deny their feelings now, it'll cause more pain for everyone in the long run.""


=== Departure and return ===
In September 2019, Giles announced her exit from Emmerdale. She stated that after seven ""fabulous years"", she wanted to leave to pursue other creative projects. Giles said that while she will miss the friends she had made on the soap, she was excited to pursue ""pastures new"". Giles filmed her final scenes on 16 October 2019, and tweeted that she ""shall miss the laughs and [has] made some great friends"", but ""sometimes it's good to leave the party when you're having a good time"". Producer Kate Brooks told Inside Soap that they had written Giles' exit into the soap, which saw her ""run a gauntlet of emotions"". They wanted her exit to be believable, as they felt that Bernice is an iconic character and had to ""make sure that we did her character justice"". Her final scenes aired on 28 November 2019 when Bernice emigrates to Australia with daughter Dee Dee (Mia Gibson-Reed).In June 2020, Giles revealed to Inside Soap that her exit storyline underwhelmed her and admitted that she wished that her character had been killed off. She felt that if Bernice had been killed off, she would have had received ""a better exit story"". Despite this, she felt that it was kind of the producers to ""leave the door open"" for her to return. Giles also told OK! magazine that producers did not want her to leave, but she wanted to pursue other projects. In April 2021, it was announced that Giles had made the decision to return to Emmerdale. She explained that her break from the soap meant that she could write and publish two books. Emmerdale producers asked her to return, and since she is ""a big believer in fate"", Giles ""took it as a sign that it was meant to be"" and accepted. Giles said that her character ""arrives back with a bang"" and felt that the audience would be entertained with her return storyline. Due to her return coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic, Giles initially wore a wig since the hairdressers were not allowed to be within two metres. She felt that she would be unable to style her hair herself and therefore wore a wig for ease. She eventually stopped wearing it due to bad comments.


== Reception ==
For her portrayal of Bernice, Giles was nominated for Most Popular Newcomer at the 1999 National Television Awards. In 2000, she earned a nomination for Best Actress. At the TV Quick Awards, Giles won Best Soap Actress. She then garnered nominations for Best Actress, Sexiest Female and Best On-Screen Partnership with Middleton at the 2002 British Soap Awards.During a feature on the ""wild women"" of Emmerdale, a writer for the Daily Mirror said ""Bernice personifies everything prim and proper compared to the soap's wild women. She is so virtuous that she has failed to hear the rustle of bushes and bedsheets as her heartthrob boyfriend Gavin swept into the village and the local lasses off their feet..."" In December 2012, Kate White of Inside Soap said she was ""thrilled"" that Giles had returned to the show, naming Bernice ""funny"", ""ditzy"", ""well-connected"", ""selfish"", ""thoughtless"", ""hilariously unreliable"", ""brutal"" and ""passionate"". In 2021, viewers ridiculed Giles and her character due to her wearing a wig onscreen. They felt the wig looked cheap and therefore she ""found herself the centre of memes and jokes on the internet and throughout the Emmerdale fandom"". The comments led to Giles stopping wearing the wig.

It was founded in March 1881 with support from the Duchesse d'Uzès, from Alfred Edwards and from France's Catholic bank Union Générale, which owned one hundred shares. Paul Eugène Bontoux (1820–1904), chief executive of the Union Générale, controlled the financial articles of Le Clairon, by means of a ""Société de Publicité Universelle"", which he had created and which funded the financial advertising pages.
The editor-in-chief Jules Cornély (1845–1907) hired away from the staff of the daily newspaper Le Gaulois, eleven journalists, including Louis de Fourcaud, Raoul Toché, Gabriel Terrail, called ""Mermeix"" (1859–1930), Arsène Houssaye (1815–1896) and Émile Blavet (1838–1924).The shareholders of Le Clairon sold the newspaper to Arthur Meyer, who also acquired the Le Gaulois in 1882 and then the Paris-Journal and merged the three newspaper franchises. The merged newspaper was published under the title Le Gaulois from August 1884. Jules Cornély had meanwhile resigned and joined the daily newspaper Le Matin but in 1888 returned to Le Gaulois (which merged with Le Figaro in 1929).

Francis Clive-Ross,"Francis Fabian Clive-Ross (1921–1981) was a publisher and author whose works focused on occultism, comparative religion, and the Traditionalist School. Clive-Ross was also a Trustee of the World of Islam Festival (held in London in 1976), as well as a justice of the peace.


== Publishing ==
Clive-Ross was the proprietor for many years of the Aquarian Book Service, established at Pates Manor. He relinquished his interest in Aquarian Press around 1966.  Soon after the London Spiritualist Alliance was reorganized as the College of Psychic Science in 1955, Clive-Ross became editor of the long-established Spiritualist journal Light. Under his editorship, the journal expanded its scope to include articles on occultism, comparative religion, and parapsychology, some of them highly critical and skeptical. Readers demanded that the journal revert to its former role as a Spiritualist publication. Clive-Ross pointed out that he had accepted editorship on the condition that Light be an independent journal. Subsequently, he resigned and Dr. V. F. Underwood took over.Clive-Ross formed Perennial Books to specialize in metaphysics, philosophy, and religion. He retained a critical faculty in dealing with occult subjects, believing that there is a good deal of fraud or self-deception in Spiritualism and psychical research.  Clive-Ross was the founder, editor-in-chief and publisher of Studies in Comparative Religion; the earliest English-language journal of traditional studies, founded in Britain in 1963 and continuing until its publication was interrupted in 1987.  The journal focused on the spiritual practices and religious symbolism of the world's religions. The journal was notable for the number of prominent Perennialists who contributed to it.

“It was because he himself believed that such ideas are the most real things in the world that Clive-Ross found the strength to struggle against difficulties (not least those of funding) which might have seemed insuperable to a lesser man. It was his deep conviction that the beliefs, the spiritual “point of view”, expressed in the pages of Studies represented a truth for which the world is hungry that enabled him to fulfill his task up to the end of his life. In this he was single-minded and showed a toughness which contrasted with his amiable and easygoing nature.”

Waiting (2015 film),"Waiting is a 2015 Indian Hindi-language drama film directed by Anu Menon. Produced by Priti Gupta and Manish Mundra under the banner of Ishka Films and Drishyam Films respectively, the film was co-written by Menon and James Ruzicka, and stars Naseeruddin Shah and Kalki Koechlin. Waiting focuses on the relationship between two people from different walks of life who befriend each other in a hospital, while nursing their respective comatose spouses. Rajat Kapoor, Suhasini Maniratnam, Arjun Mathur, Ratnabali Bhattacharjee and Rajeev Ravindranathan play supporting roles in the film.
The development of the film began in June 2014, when Menon signed Koechlin and Shah for an untitled project. Principal photography started in November 2014 in the South Indian coastal city of Kochi; Neha Parti served as the cinematographer for the film. New Zealand-based singer-songwriter Mikey McCleary composed the film's score. Nitin Baid and Apurva Asrani edited the film, and Atika Chohan wrote the dialogue. Waiting also marked the Hindi film debut of the prominent South Indian actress-director Suhasini Maniratnam. Koechlin also made her debut as a lyricist with the film's soundtrack, writing the song ""Waiting for You"".
Waiting had its world premiere at the Dubai International Film Festival on 11 December 2015 to positive reviews from critics. It was also screened at the closing gala of the London Asian Film Festival, where Menon won the Best Director Award. The film was released theatrically in India on 27 May 2016. Upon release in India, Waiting was well received by critics, with particular praise for the performances of Koechlin and Shah, and Menon's direction. The film had a below average run at the box office, collecting a total of ₹35 million (US$440,000) during its theatrical run.


== Plot ==
Shiv Natraj (Naseeruddin Shah), an elderly psychology professor, arrives at a hospital in Kochi to visit his comatose wife Pankaja (Suhasini Maniratnam). Tara Kapoor Desphande (Kalki Koechlin), a young advertising agent, also arrives at the hospital during the night after being delivered news of a car accident involving her husband, Rajat Deshpande (Arjun Mathur). She is consoled by Rajat's eccentric co-worker Girish (Rajeev Ravindranathan), but dismisses him abruptly. Tara is deeply disturbed to see Rajat breathing on a ventilator, and leaves immediately.
In the waiting lounge, Tara approaches Shiv, believing him to be a doctor, and asks for his advice. He reveals that his wife had a stroke eight months ago while he was out watching a cricket match, and has been in a coma ever since. The two bond over their similar situations. Later, Girish drops Tara off at a hotel and gives her Rajat's bag. Tara finds his watch in it and puts it on. The next day she is angered after reading an intimate message on Rajat's phone from a colleague Sheetal, who is later revealed to be a man. Shiv witnesses the whole misunderstanding, and the two share a light moment. He later visits her at the hotel, and she shares her disappointment with her friends and followers on social media for having abandoned her. She commends Shiv for his composure, as he explains the five stages of grief to her.
Tara finds her strength in Shiv, a wiser and more experienced counterpart. The two start spending most of their spare time together coping with their grief, despite being completely opposite in nature. Shiv takes Tara to the temple, and she takes him shopping. Rajat's doctor, Nirupam Malhotra (Rajat Kapoor), tells Tara that Rajat has a hematoma in his brain and an operation might help him recover, but it carries the risk of partial paralysis. Tara is torn, as she believes Rajat would not want to take the risk, and seeks advice from Shiv. He is already at loggerheads with Dr. Malhotra, dismissing him as a pawn of the hospital board and the insurance companies who only care about making money and not the patients. Tara and Shiv get into a heated argument. Shiv lashes out angrily at Tara for not giving Rajat a chance at life. Tara retorts that she is a realist, and dismisses Shiv for being selfish and making his wife go through pain for his own sake.
Tara's best friend Ishita (Ratnabali Bhattacharjee) arrives at Kochi and advises her to start chanting prayers and to inform Rajat's estranged parents of his situation. Despite being an atheist, Tara chants Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō when she is alone with Rajat. Shiv desperately attempts to convince Malhotra to perform a spinal decompression on his wife, but he disregards Shiv's research and refuses to proceed with surgery. Tara discusses Rajat's surgery with Ishita and decides not to go ahead with it, which further angers Malhotra. Ishita leaves to aid her ailing son. Tara realises that she is no longer Ishita's top priority, now that Ishita is married. Shiv and Tara make up and later that night dance together at Shiv's house, much to the amusement of his neighbours. They get upset thinking about their spouses and discuss what they meant to them, before falling asleep in the living room.
The next morning, Tara leaves early and decides to inform Rajat's mother. After Girish brings Tara the required insurance papers, she thanks him for always being there for her and apologises for being rude. She decides to go ahead with the surgery after all. Rajat is taken to surgery, and she holds his hand until they arrive at the operating room. Shiv, on the other hand, decides to take Pankaja off the ventilator and let his wife herself make the final call. Pankaja tries to breathe on her own as the viewers are treated with flashbacks of the heyday of both couples. Tara takes a seat in the waiting lounge, and is joined by Shiv as the camera pans out.

== Production ==


=== Development ===
Made on a modest budget, the movie, Waiting was produced by Priti Gupta of Ishka Films and Manish Mundra of Drishyam Films. The film was directed by Anu Menon, her second directorial work after the romantic comedy London, Paris, New York (2012). She also co-wrote the script with fellow London Film School alumnus and former anesthesiologist James Ruzicka. Menon, inspired by her own personal experience, started working on the film's script with Ruzicka. She called the writing process extremely difficult as they had to figure out ""what it means to be associated with a comatose patient, both emotionally and medically"". She said later that Ruzicka's experience as a medical practitioner proved really helpful in developing a logical understanding of the situation. Menon revealed that she had begun writing the story years before the actual production for the film began, and that it took her several years to complete it.Pre-production work began in July 2014, when Mundra, a Dubai-based film producer, agreed to produce. Menon wanted an entirely different setting for the film, away from ""fast paced city life"", and decided to set the story in the South Indian state of Kerala. The film's director of photography was cinematographer Neha Parti Martyani, who had been previously associated with films including My Name Is Khan (2010) and Yamla Pagla Deewana (2011). The film's dialogue was written by Atika Chohan. Prajakta Ghag was the film's production designer.Entertainment website Bollywood Hungama reported that Kalki Koechlin was set to star in Menon's upcoming film. The published reports revealed that Koechlin would be playing the role of the young, brash, and social-media-savvy Tara Deshpande. Koechlin's co-star from That Girl in Yellow Boots (2011) and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011), Naseeruddin Shah, joined the cast after he was approached by Menon, who sent him the film's script in an e-mail. Shah, who did not have any prior knowledge of Menon's work, accepted the male lead role in the film. To prepare for the role, Koechlin worked on the dialect in which her character spoke, an amalgamation of Hindi and English. She also dyed her hair black for the role, as Menon wanted her to look more ""earthy"". In an interview with Gulf News, Koechlin said she loved the film's vibe and compared it to the American drama Lost In Translation (2003). In a separate e-mail interview with Arti Daniel of The Khaleej Times, Shah said that Waiting was his way of making up to the audience for the spate of ""ghastly movies"" that he did in 2014.South Indian actress and director Suhasini Maniratnam made her debut in Hindi cinema with Waiting; she was cast in the role of Pankaja, Shah's character's wife. Menon talked about her experience working with Suhasini saying, ""With her experience, she also helped me with a few difficult scenes behind the camera."" Arjun Mathur played the role of Rajat Deshpande, Tara's husband, who is involved in a car accident; Rajat Kapoor played Nirupam Malhotra, a doctor at the Kochi Hospital. Ratnabali Bhatachajee, Rajeev Ravindranathan and Marin Babu played supporting roles in the film. The rest of the film's supporting cast consisted mainly of Malayali actors, including Dinesh Nair and Krishna Sankar, who were signed up with assistance from Gautam Pisharody, a local casting agent.


=== Filming and post-production ===
Principal photography began in November 2014 in the coastal city of Kochi, Kerala. The shoot for the entire film was completed on schedule in around 30 days. Of the shooting experience, Menon said, ""The experience was beautiful though there were many challenges as we were predominantly an all-woman crew."" In an interview with The Hindu, Koechlin revealed that throughout the production process, she questioned Menon several times as she wanted to better understand her character's background. She said that she would have lengthy discussions regarding particular scenes with Menon, who would then redraft the part. She also enjoyed working with Shah, describing the experience as ""gratifying"".The team of editors for Waiting was headed by Apurva Asrani and Nitin Baid. The sound mixing was done by London-based sound engineer Roland Heap, with assistance from Mandar Kamalapurkar and Udit Daseja. Prajakta Ghag was the film's  Production Designer and the marketing department was headed by Parull Gosain. The editing process for the film took place in March 2015. The film's final cut ran for a total of 98  minutes.Menon talked to The National about the film prior to its release, saying that the story was close to her heart as it was inspired by her own personal experience. On working with Koechlin and Shah she said, ""He (Shah) was punctual and always prepared, he gave his best performance in the first take. Kalki allows herself to be vulnerable. She is more porous and chilled out."" Menon acknowledged the chemistry of the leading duo and said that they were committed to the project and non-demanding. She described Waiting as a ""gentle and poignant film"" and said, ""It would make the audiences want to reach out to the leading characters and help them find their answers.""


== Soundtrack ==
The film's music was composed by Mikey McCleary, with Kavita Seth, Nikhil D'Souza, Anushka Manchanda, Vishal Dadlani and McCleary serving as vocalists for the album. The tracks' lyrics were written by McCleary, Koechlin Manoj Muntashir, and Ankur Tewari. The first song on the album, ""Tu Hai Toh Main Hoon"", a pop ballad by Manchanda and D'Souza, was released on YouTube on 4 May 2016. The album consisted of three other songs; McCleary's ""Got My Eyes For You"", Manchanda's ""Waiting For You"", and Seth and Dadlani's ""Zara Zara"". The complete soundtrack for Waiting was released on 16 May 2016, under the Zee Music Company label.The film's soundtrack was well received by critics. The tracks ""Tu Hai Toh Main Hoon"" and ""Zara Zara"" garnered positive response from critics and audiences alike; Manavi Kapoor of Business Standard remarked, ""'Zara Zara' and 'Tu Hai Toh Main Hun' are haunting and perfectly capture the poignant tone of the film."" Ushnota Paul writing for Filmfare was also laudatory of both the songs, as each ""lingers with you for long"". In another soundtrack review for The Times of India, Mohar Basu praised McCleary's ""trademark effervescence"", which made the soundtrack of Waiting ""oh-so-charming."" She summed up by writing that the album had, ""a few pleasant songs and even though they all sound fairly similar, it has a satisfying effect"". Manish Gaekwad of Scroll.in gave a mixed review; he was analogous in the praise of the ""pleasent"" nature of the tracks, but was critical of the lyrics that didn't go beyond the ""greeting-card sentiment"".

=== Marketing and release ===
Waiting had its world premiere on 11 December 2015 at the 12th edition of the Dubai International Film Festival. There the film's executive producer Priti Gupta, founder of Ishka Films, emphasised the universality of the film and said, ""It is an endearing and beautiful movie for not just Indian[s], but the world audience, as it is essentially about the universal human circumstances, which are deftly portrayed in a tender yet humorous way.""
Manish Mundra, founder of Drishyam Films, expressed his delight at the screening of the film, acknowledging that Dubai was one of the biggest overseas markets for Indian films. The film was also screened at the closing gala of the London Asian Film Festival, and at the Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles.The official trailer for Waiting was released on 22 April 2016 to positive response from both critics and audience alike. Rajani Chandel of The Times of India asserted that it ""will move you to tears"", while The Huffington Post India editor Ankur Pathak noted the leading duo's ""effortlessly comfortable vibe"", and dubbed the trailer ""lovely"". Menon talked about the challenges of promoting an independent film and attracting viewers saying, ""The distribution is first weekend collection driven [...] Those depending on a buzz created by word of mouth are at a disadvantage."" The film had a special screening prior to its theatrical release which was attended by the cast and crew and other Bollywood celebrities including: Gulshan Devaiah, Radhika Apte, Huma Qureshi, Rajkummar Rao and Adil Hussain. It had its theatrical release on 27 May 2016 in India.


=== Box office ===
The film had a poor opening at the box office as the morning vacancy varied from 2 to 3 per cent in multiplexes. The film managed to collect a mere ₹2.5 million (US$31,000) on its opening day. It was released alongside other indie films including Veerappan and Phobia, both of which also had a relatively poor opening. However, Waiting showed good growth over the day with the best occupancy among the aforementioned films. The numbers grew as the film collected ₹4.8 million (US$60,000) and ₹5.5 million (US$69,000) on its second and third day respectively, bringing the first weekend gross to a total of ₹12.8 million (US$160,000). It carried on with steady numbers through the first and the second week collecting ₹25 million (US$310,000). Waiting grossed a total of around ₹35 million (US$440,000) in its entire run at the box office.


== Reception ==


=== India ===

The film opened to largely positive reviews in India. Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the film the highest praise and deemed it ""a well-chiselled marvel"" saying: ""Waiting is at once heart-wrenching and uplifting ... marked by deep philosophical undertones, but it is never unduly ponderous."" A reviewer for The New Indian Express also spoke highly of the film saying, ""Not since Ritesh Batra's The Lunchbox have I seen an indie film addressing itself to the ageless issue of human desolation and individual grief with such warmth, dignity, grace, honesty and humour."" For Namrata Joshi of The Hindu, the script was ""dignified [and] without any false notes"", and the film managed ""to stand on its own emotional ground ... The people, situations, relationships, feelings are layered, warm and humorous, ringing true in their complexities."" Mohar Basu of The Times of India called the film ""thought-provoking"" writing: ""Menon has whipped up a warm tale about love, loss and surviving life's catastrophic blows, with such simplicity.""
Kunal Guha of the Mumbai Mirror lauded the film's direction and cinematography saying, ""Menon has the tenacity of a Sofia Coppola to produce frames where not much happens but one is unable to look away"", and concluded, ""The film deserves a watch for being one that doesn't try too hard and for its approach to an extreme situation."" Rohit Bhatnagar of Deccan Chronicle, while also praising the technical expertise, said, ""Neha Parti Matiyani beautifully captures the beautiful city of Kochi"" and called the film ""unmissable"" saying, ""Waiting is a refreshing subject that is engaging enough right up till its open-ended climax."" Shubhra Gupta writing for The Indian Express thought that the film was ""too explanatory, too talky"", and that ""the most effective moments in the film occur when the two leads are allowed to fall silent, to just be in that moment, to loosen up"". While lauding the film's treatment of the subject matter, Gupta described Waiting as ""a film about life, lasting love and impending loss which explores a zone Bollywood doesn't bother with"".The performances of the leading pair of Koechlin and Shah were chiefly praised by several critics. Guha in his review remarked ""this film belongs to Kalki, who impresses by managing to wordlessly convey her character's state of mind in every scene"". Chatterjee, offering a similar observation, wrote that Koechlin ""provides the ideal foil, adding immensely to the emotional depth of the tale and heightening the conflict between two unlike poles"". The latter thought that the lead performances empowered the film. In her review for Rediff.com Sukanya Verma called the film ""absolutely riveting"", and wrote of Koechlin that ""[t]here's something stunningly unhindered about Kalki and her aura. She uses this quality in the most mesmeric fashion to create a woman we sympathise with and wish well for.""In her review for Firstpost, Anna M. M. Vetticad wrote that the leading pair ""shine in a lovely film"" noting that chemistry between them was ""unmistakable"". She concluded by saying, ""[Waiting] is both sad and amusing, believable, well acted and very well told"". Sweta Kaushal of Hindustan Times summed up her review by writing, ""Packaged with Naseeruddin as the adorable old man ... and Kalki as the charming young, energetic woman, Waiting is a delight."" While acknowledging the ""underdeveloped and overwritten"" parts of the plot, Gupta was nonetheless appreciative of Koechlin and Shah, calling them good fits for their roles. Rajeev Masand writing for News18 offered similar observations; he criticized the ""weak"" plotting, but talked well of the characters: ""you yearn for them to just shut up and soak in the silence. Each time they do, the film soars."" Also lauding Shah's ""real"" and Koechlin's ""endearing"" performances, he wrote that Waiting, ""raises important questions about life, love, and letting go. Plus there are those two splendid performances. That's plenty to merit a viewing.""


=== Overseas ===
The film received positive reviews from critics at the Dubai International Film Festival who praised the story's narrative, Menon's direction, and the performances of the lead pairing of Koechlin and Shah. Gautaman Bhaskaran of Hindustan Times called the film a ""tragic, witty affair"" and praised the humour of presenting the contrast between Shiv and Tara. Fionnuala Halligan of Screen International lauded the cinematography and Neha Parti Mtiyani's ""dignified lenswork"" and wrote further, ""Waiting simmers in its locales without being brash or boastful; the colours of India are there, glowing at the sidelines."" She also lauded Koechlin's and Shah's performances saying that the film ""benefits greatly from Koechlin's appeal ... she has an expressive face to match her talent"" and added that Shah's presence ""lends the film its grace-notes"". Deborah Young of The Hollywood Reporter also gave it a positive review calling the film: ""A tender, often humorous tale with sparkling performances."" In her opinion, ""Koechlin does an exceptional job navigating the shoals of this as a kooky drama queen"" while ""Shah brings great feeling and complexity to the role of the wise, tolerant Shiv.""

Robert Chapatte,"Robert Chapatte (14 October 1921 – 19 January 1997) was a French cyclist and sports journalist, voice of the Tour de France on television and radio and the inventor of Chapatte's Law.


== Racing career ==
Chapatte started cycling at the Vélodrome d'Hiver in Paris, where he became popular with the crowd in madison races. In 1944, he won the amateur team pursuit championship with Roger Riol, Jean Guegen and André Chassang. He was a professional for 11 seasons, from 1944 to 1954. He rode the Tour de France from 1948 to 1952, finishing 16th in 1949. He won the Circuit des Pyrénées in 1949 and the Grand Prix d'Espéraza in 1952. In 1949, riding for France in the Tour de France, he was the first rider to answer a live question on French television.


== Journalism ==
On retirement from cycling, he became a sports writer for L'Aurore and another daily paper, Le Provençal.
In 1955, he provided the commentary for the Tour de l'Ouest on Radio Monte Carlo. A technical error during the race led to his voice going out on a rival network. Engineers switched his commentary to the state channel, ORTF, and that of George Briquet to Radio Monte Carlo. The incident forged a friendship between the two men and Briquet was able to bring Chapatte to ORTF. He stayed there until 1959 and then moved to television. There he stayed until 1968, when he became one of many taken off the air in the shake-up that hit state television after the student riots and other political protests across France in May that year. He returned to radio, working for Europe 1.
Chapatte wrote from the end of his racing career for the sports magazine Miroir Sprint, particularly for its Tour de France issue. In January 1961 he joined the staff of a new monthly, Miroir du Cyclisme, writing ""Robert Chapatte's Notebook"", but his name vanished from the editorial committee in autumn 1962.
In 1975 he returned to television as head of sport at Antenne 2. He created the sports analysis programme, Stade 2, which is still broadcast on Antenne 2's successor, France 2. He presented the programme from 1975 to 1985, then became consultant commentator on the Tour de France with a man who eventually followed him as head of sport, Patrick Chêne.


== Chapatte's Law ==
Chapatte's Law was a calculation drawn from his experience as a rider and commentator. It held that it took a group of chasing riders 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) to make a one-minute gain on a lone rider. A sole breakaway with more than a minute for each remaining 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) was therefore likely to win the race. The law is still frequently cited in television and radio commentaries and still holds largely true.
Chapatte held that the minute was precise. Anything less and the break would fail, as when Bjarne Riis was caught a few hundred metres before the line when he held 56 seconds rather than a minute on the Gap stage of the 1993 Tour de France.
Chapatte insisted too that a lone rider with a minute's lead had more chance than a group with a larger lead. While a lone rider would ride hard to the end, a group will ease up to gather breath for the sprint and to watch each other for surprise attacks.
The law has suffered in modern times by committed chases organised by teams to get their sprinters to the front. Chapatte's minute is more likely now to be 90 seconds.


== Death ==
Chapatte covered his last Tour de France in July 1994, abandoning the race in the Pyrenees when he fell ill. ""I fell asleep in Lourdes and I woke up in hospital in Paris,"" he said.Chapatte fell ill again in 1997. His last appearance in public was to attend the funeral of another veteran cycling journalist, Pierre Chany. Chapatte died in the Pitié-Salpêtrière in Paris at 74. He is buried in the cimetière ancien at Neuilly-sur-Seine.
Chapatte was awarded the Légion d'Honneur.

John Sutton (geologist),"John Sutton (8 July 1919 – 6 September 1992) was an English geologist.Born in London into the family that established Suttons Seeds, John's father, John Gerald Sutton, was an engineer credited with inventing the motor lawn-mower, among other things, and his mother, Kathleen Richard, was a teacher of classics. In 1937 he began a general science degree at Imperial College, graduating in geology in 1941 with an Abbreviated Honours degree (not an Honours degree) for war service in the army.
From 1946-1949 he undertook research on the Lewisian gneiss of N.W.Scotland with fellow student Janet Watson. Both finished their PhDs, and married, in 1949. Their joint work on the Precambrian rocks of Scotland, which they first published in 1951 was highly influential. Sutton and Watson were later jointly recognised for this work with the awards of the Lyell Fund of the Geological Society of London in 1954, and of the Bigsby Medal in 1965.Sutton was appointed Lecturer in the Department of Geology in 1948, before he had completed his PhD, and then spent the rest of his academic career at Imperial College. He was promoted to Reader in Geology in 1956, and Professor of Geology in 1958. In 1964, he became Head of Department, and was shortly afterwards appointed Dean of the Royal School of Mines (1965–68 and 1974–77). He played an important role in the establishment of the first cross-departmental interdisciplinary research centre at Imperial, the Interdepartmental Centre for Environmental Technology (ICCET), which he chaired for a while. In 1980, Sutton took on the role of Pro Rector of Imperial College. He retired in 1983, as Emeritus Professor. 
Sutton took on many and influential administrative roles from the 1960s to the 1980s. He was member of the BAS Scientific Advisory Committee (1970–85); member of Natural Environment Research Council (1977–79) and Chairman, British National Committee on Antarctic Research, from 1979. He also served on numerous boards, committees and councils including the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, the Natural History Museum, London. He was elected President of the Geologists' Association for 1966–68. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1966, serving as their Vice-President in 1975. John Sutton's archive of papers is held at Imperial College.He died in 1992 and was buried in Martinstown, Dorset. He is commemorated by the Sutton Heights in Antarctica.


== Family ==
John Sutton and Janet Watson married in April 1949, and had two daughters who both died at birth. Janet Watson died in 1985, and John Sutton later married Betty Middleton-Sandford.

SH 6 (Albania),"The National Road 6 (Albanian: Rruga shtetërore SH6) leads from Milot to Peshkopi.
The SH6 breaks off from National Road 1 at Milot and travels through Burrel, Klos and Bulqizë to Peshkopi. 
The first section, between Milot and Klos, follows the Mat river valley, initially in a narrow cutting through the Skanderbeg range. North of Burrel in the hilly terrain of Mat it often travels far from the river. From Klos, the SH6 rises around 550 metres to the Bualli Pass at 842 metres above sea level. East of this, it follows the Bulqizë valley to the Drin river, which it crosses at a narrow point. At Maqellarë, there is a junction with the road to Debar in North Macedonia. There is a new by-pass at Maqellarë. From here the SH6 travels north to Peshkopi, travelling through hilly terrain far from the river once more. The first few kilometres of this road have been renovated recently.


== Arbër Highway ==
Between Bulqizë and the Drin, the SH6 has been expanded into a broader, two-lane road. West of Bulqizë, construction was still in progress, as of 2011, as part of the national highway construction project. The new road would provide a direct link from Tirana to the Macedonian border, without the detour through Milot and Burrel. As part of this, the Qafa e Buallit pass will be replaced by a short tunnel. For the section travelling through the mountains between Tirana and Klos, many tunnels and complicated bridge systems are required.

Peregrinus maidis,"Peregrinus maidis, commonly known as the corn planthopper, is a species of insect in the order Hemiptera and the family Delphacidae. It is widespread throughout most tropical and subtropical regions on earth, including southern North America, South America, Africa, Australia, Southeast Asia and China. P. maidis are a commercially important pest of maize and its relatives. In addition to physical plant damage, P. maidis is the vector for several species-specific maize viruses, including maize stripe virus, maize mosaic virus and the non-pathogenic Peregrinus maidis reovirus.


== Description ==
P. maidis demonstrate sexual dimorphism in body size between males and females. Males have a body length of 2mm with a 6mm wingspan, whereas females are slightly larger at 3mm long and 7mm wingspan. The species is mainly yellow with dark brown to black markings, but colouration ranges from greenish-yellow to brownish-yellow. The forewings are longer than the body. The hind tibiae possess multiple spines and a large movable spur.


== Distribution and habitat ==
P. maidis are found in most tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world including the southeast United States, Hawaii, Central and South America, Africa, Australia, Southeast Asia and southern China. The species thrives in low elevation, high humidity locations and populations will decrease at altitudes above 800m. It is suspected that P. maidis cannot move into higher latitudes due to an inability to overwinter.P. maidis are thought to have originated in Australia as a pest of sorghum but quickly spread with the widespread cultivation of the closely related sugarcane and maize plants. This specificity to feed on a single tribe of plants results in P. maidis being classified as an oligophagous herbivore. Attempts to rear the species on other host plants has resulted in decreased fecundity, body size, life span, and slower nymph development.


== Life cycle ==
Females lay 20-30 eggs within the midribs of their host-plant's leaves. Under normal conditions, development from hatchling to adult takes approximately 20 days. However, development of P. maidis nymphs is highly temperature dependent. Normal development occurs between 20-27 °C and has five juvenile instar stages. Extreme temperatures (below 10 °C and above 30 °C) result in a loss of the fifth instar and a direct molt from fourth instar to adult, but full development is extended dramatically to 74 days. Rearing at a temperature of 15 °C results in an extra, sixth, instar and a 65-day development time. P. maidis occupies warm climates and is able to reproduce year round, but development is affected by temperature changes. Another factor that affects development is nutrient availability. Increased levels of Nitrogen fertilizers in plant tissues result in shorter development times, more eggs produced, and increases in juvenile survival rates and adult body size.Similar to other planthoppers, two different types (morphs) of adult P. maidis can develop depending on environmental conditions. The first, brachypterous, have short, underdeveloped wings and most often develop as a response to high quality host plants, low conspecific density, and no need for dispersal. The second, macropterous, have fully developed wings and emerge when dispersal is required due to high population density or low quality host plants. The purpose of the macropters is to disperse and lay eggs on corn seedlings, whereas the brachypters are to simply feed on the growing plant and reproduce. Once the plant starts to age, more macropters are produced and the cycle continues.


== Interactions with humans ==


=== Role as a pest ===
P. maidis are an economically important pest of maize. Infestations will physically damage the host plant because the insect breaks through the vascular tissue with its tibia spur and feeds on the sap exuded. The physical results on the plant includes wilting, yellowing of the leaves, stem weakness, and even death. Damage is more severe in young or drought-stressed plants. In addition to physical damage, P. maidis can also introduce mold and infection to the plant while piercing the tissues. P. maidis feeding behaviour alone can result in a 10-15% crop loss.


=== Role as a disease vector ===
P. maidis is a vector for several species-specific maize viruses. Peregrinus maidis reovirus (PgMV) from the family Reoviridae, is a non-pathogenic virus transmitted by the insect. Maize mosaic rhabdovirus (MMV) (family: Rhabdoviridae) and maize tenuivirus (MStV) (genus: Tenuivirus) are important viruses that are pathogenic and can reduce crop yield by 9-90%. It has been suggested that the spread of P. maidis and these two viruses to the New World contributed to the collapse of the Mayan civilization.MMV is not transmitted from parent to offspring; instead, individuals become infected with the virus when they feed on an infected plant. Any juvenile instar stage can become infected, but the virus has a 3-week latency period before it can be transmitted to another plant. Therefore, usually only adults are able to pass the infection onto a healthy plant. Macropterous adults dispersing to a new plant actively avoid plants that are showing symptoms of MMV infection. These adults demonstrate a preference for asymptomatic plants. They are most likely responding to a cue about the quality of the host plant.


=== Human resistance to pest ===
Research is exploring how to reduce crop loss by P. maidis and the diseases they carry. Farmers should avoid using nitrogen fertilizers which have been shown to directly increase the success of P. maidis. Unfortunately, no natural plant resistance exists so entomologists are searching for a synthetic alternative. Recently, scientists have introduced corn that possess a modified resistance gene that has demonstrated some success. The genetically modified corn had decreased infection and transmission of MMV, but did not affect the fitness of P. maidis or the ability for the insect to be infected by MMV. Instead, the gene increased the plant’s resistance to the virus, which decreased the disease transmission rate.

Wag-Aero CUBy,"The Wag-Aero CUBy is a replica of the Piper J-3, designed by Dick Wagner and marketed by Wag-Aero of Lyons, Wisconsin as plans or in kit form.The aircraft is currently marketed under the name Wag-Aero Sport Trainer.


== Design and development ==
Wag-Aero  started with a line of inspection covers, then eventually a comprehensive line of aircraft parts, including a full line of parts for the Piper Cub. After several attempts to purchase the rights to the Piper Cub for new production, Wag-Aero owner Jack Wagner designed a homebuilt kit that would allow homebuilders to construct new aircraft similar to the Cub.While the CUBy was initially offered with wooden wing ribs and spars like the Piper Cub, aluminum ribs and spars were later added as an option, also like later Cubs. The aircraft does differ from the original Piper design in several ways including having its fuselage fabricated from 4130 steel instead of the Cub's original 1025 carbon steel and utilizing a conventional elevator-mounted trim tab in place of the Cub's jack screw trimming system that adjusts the Cub's elevator angle of incidence.The CUBy drawings were drafted by Bill Blake.The prototype first flew on March 12, 1975 fitted with skis.


== Operational history ==
The introductory model was displayed with a contrasting paint scheme, one half painted green with a yellow stripe, and the other half painted yellow with a green stripe. This unusual ""court jester"" paint scheme was used to differentiate the prototype from the standard yellow scheme used on the Piper Cub, for marketing purposes.Paul Poberezny became the first customer to build a CUBy. Poberezny's aircraft became part of the EAA AirVenture Museum Foundation and was used to demonstrate the use of automotive fuel in aircraft engines for the Experimental Aircraft Association. The designer of the aircraft Dick Wagner flew the unpressurized aircraft as high as 20,000 ft (6,096 m) to demonstrate that auto fuel would not cause vapor lock.

Chinese pickles,"Chinese pickles or Chinese preserved vegetables consist of vegetables or fruits that have been fermented by pickling with salt and brine (simplified Chinese: 咸菜; traditional Chinese: 鹹菜; pinyin: Xiáncài), or marinated in mixtures based on soy sauce or savory bean pastes (酱菜; 醬菜; jiàngcài). The former is usually done using high-fiber vegetables and fruits, such as Chinese cabbage, carrot, apple and pineapple, while the latter marinated group is made using a wide variety of vegetables, ranging from mustards and cucumbers to winter melon and radishes. As of now, there are more than 130 kinds of pickles.


== History ==
Vegetables have been a food resource for human survival since ancient times and in order to supply people with basic food needs, it was necessary to store some vegetables during the peak harvest season for consumption in the off-season. Therefore, the ancient Chinese used salt to preserve fresh vegetables by salting and pickling them in earthen jars.Claims to the history of pickled vegetables date back to the Shang dynasty. The Shijing (~11th century BCE) mentions ""葅"", understood to be a word for pickles. The pickled vegetables and fruit we refer to today date in practice back to the sixth century B.C.E. In the following Zhou Dynasty, Northern Wei Dynasty, Tang Dynasty, Song Dynasty, Yuan Dynasty and Ming Dynasty, there were historical records and books about pao cai.


== Flavor ==
Chinese pickles all need to balance the flavors of sweet, sour, pungent, salt, bitter and savory. There are also spicy pickles with floral notes, such as the Sichuan pepper. However, most Chinese pickles still aim for a balance between the tastes of vinegar, salt, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, hot chili, sugar, and the vegetable or fruit itself.
Most pickles need to wait for a few months for the vegetables and fruit to ferment, but there are also ""quick pickles"" which can be eaten a few hours or a few days after preparation. Cucumber pickles, for example, may be eaten after they have been pickled in a jar for three hours.


== Consumption ==
Chinese pickle can be eaten directly from the jar as an appetizer, or used as an ingredient for cooking a larger dish. Before the meal, it is served with wine, beer, sodas, or tea to stimulate people's appetite. People eat the small dishes of Chinese pickles and some snacks to drink and chat. Chinese people can also eat pickles as a dish with steamed rice when they do not have many dishes. Chinese pickles are used as ingredients to cook the food as flavor base. Pickling ginger and pickling pepper are most frequently used ingredients to make Sichuan food. It can also help to flavor and enhance the vegetable, meat, poultry, and seafood. For example, Chinese cook duck soup with pickling radish to make the soup more delicious.


== Fermented ==
Vegetables and plums are salted and allowed to ferment with the help of lactic acid bacteria. Depending on the desired product, the vegetable may also be fermented with Chinese wine and spices. Some types of these preserved vegetables are produced through being repeatedly dried after the fermentation.

== Marinated ==
Vegetables are usually marinated in a soy sauce mixture with sugar, vinegar, salt, and additional spices. The vegetable are lightly boiled in the soy mixture before being left to cool and absorb the marinade:

Cucumbers (酱瓜; 醬瓜; jiàng guā)
Radishes (腌萝卜; 醃蘿蔔; yān luóbo)
Bitter melon (腌苦瓜; 醃苦瓜; yān kǔguā)
Garlic (腊八蒜; 臘八蒜; làbā suàn)


== Possible health hazards of pickled vegetables ==
The World Health Organization has listed pickled vegetables as a possible carcinogen, and the British Journal of Cancer released an online 2009 meta-analysis of research on pickles as increasing the risks of esophageal cancer. The report, citing limited data in a statistical meta analysis, indicates a potential two-fold increased risk of oesophageal cancer associated with Asian pickled vegetable consumption. Results from the research are described as having ""high heterogeneity"" and the study said that further well-designed prospective studies were warranted. However, their results stated ""The majority of subgroup analyses showed a statistically significant association between consuming pickled vegetables and oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma"".The 2009 meta-analysis reported heavy infestation of pickled vegetables with fungi. Some common fungi can facilitate the formation of N-nitroso compounds, which are strong oesophageal carcinogens in several animal models. Roussin red methyl ester, a non-alkylating nitroso compound with tumour-promoting effect in vitro, was identified in pickles from Linxian in much higher concentrations than in samples from low-incidence areas. Fumonisin mycotoxins have been shown to cause liver and kidney tumours in rodents.A 2017 study in Chinese Journal of Cancer  has linked salted vegetables (common among Chinese cuisine) to a fourfold increase in nasopharynx cancer, where fermentation was a critical step in creating nitrosamines, which some are confirmed carcinogens, as well as activation of Epstein–Barr virus by fermentation products.

Adrian Barath,"Adrian Boris Barath (born 14 April 1990) is a former West Indian cricketer. A right-hand opening batsman for Trinidad and Tobago, Barath made his Test debut in November 2009, becoming the youngest West Indian to score a century. He played his first One Day International (ODI) in March the following year. He is also the second youngest West Indian to have scored a century in first-class cricket, after Bruce Pairaudeau. Barath played his final test match for West Indies in 2012.


== Career ==
A protégé of Brian Lara, Barath became the youngest West Indian player to make his first-class debut since Ramnaresh Sarwan when he first appeared for Trinidad and Tobago at 16. In his debut match, Barath scored 73 against Guyana and put on a 170 runs partnership with captain Daren Ganga. This gave them the record for Trinidad and Tobago highest opening partnership in first-class cricket. Barath scored his maiden century in his second match. He became the youngest player in the Caribbean to score a century in first-class cricket since Bruce Pairaudeau in 1947, and he followed that up with a second century in the next game.Barath was part of the West Indies U-19 team for the 2008 World Cup played for the West Indies A team against the touring England side in January 2009, making 132. During the Airtel Champions League Twenty20 2009, Barath made his T20 debut for Trinidad and Tobago against Diamond Eagles where he made 63 runs off 41 deliveries.
He made his Test debut for the West Indies against Australia at the Gabba on 26 November 2009. He fell early in the first innings with a score of 15 but led the West Indies in the second innings scoring 104 runs when following on. He became the first West Indian to score a century on debut since Dwayne Smith. At the age of 19, he is also the youngest ever West Indian player to score a Test century, having taken over from George Headley.Though initially included in the West Indies' 15-man squad for the 2011 World Cup, Barath suffered an injury to his right hamstring and was unable to play in the tournament. As a consequence he was replaced by Devon Smith. Initially, he was expected to take three weeks to recover, however two months later he was still unable to play. Barath returned to the West Indies side for the last of five ODIs against India in June. A three-Test series followed and Barath replaced Kraigg Brathwaite as opener. Though he had played in the Trinidad & Tobago Twenty20 Festival, Barath struggled during the Test series, looking out of practice and edging to the slips. He scored 150 runs from six innings.The West Indies toured Bangladesh in October 2011 and during the opening ODI Barath incurred an injury to his hamstring and did not play again during the tour and was replaced by the in-form Lendl Simmons. Barath recovered in time to be selected for the squad to tour India the following month, taking over from Simmons who was omitted. He scored 17 runs from two ODIs, but was more successful in the Test series, managing 128 runs including two half-centuries from two matches including two half-centuries. Injury forced batsman Shivnarine Chanderpaul to miss the third and final Test, and it had been anticipated that without his influence the inexperienced West Indian batting line up might struggle. In the event, Barath opened the batting with Braithwaite and the pair put on a 137-run opening stand in the first innings, the West Indies' highest partnership for the first wicket since 2006.Australia toured the West Indies for five ODIs and three Tests beginning in March 2012. A finger injury forced Barath to miss the first three ODIs, but having proved his fitness by scoring 114 for Trinidad and Tobago against Guyana in the Regional Four Day Competition was called up for the final two matches, replacing fellow opener Kieran Powell who had scored twenty runs from three matches. Playing in all three Tests, Barath managed 65 runs. Barath was not alone in struggling against Australia's bowlers, and captain Darren Sammy remarked ""Stats don't lie. Our top order did not click against Australia, but the selectors have shown faith in two of them [Adrian Barath and Kieran Powell]. They are quite young, they are still learning on the job. Yes, they will fail sometimes. But there is one thing we won't do and that is give in.""Barath fell out of the West Indies test team after the series against England in the 2012 English summer. In 2014, Barath took a break from cricket to prioritise his Jehovah's Witness faith. Despite several attempts in the following years from cricket stakeholders to lure him to return, Barath never returned to cricket. Barath was aged 24 at the time of what turned out to be his final first class game, a very early end to a once promising international career.
